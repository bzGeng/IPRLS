1	i subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to woodworkers journal since 1990 . each magazine has a character of it 's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents . this magazine is a bit more complex than , say wood magazine . it should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified . i have one of woodworking journal 's projects in my living room . it is perhaps the most beautiful piece i have ever made . if you have become an advanced amature ( sp ? ) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others
0	i ordered this magazine thru amazon three months ago , and still have n't received a single issue . i 've emailed their subscription department to no avail . they have my money , but i do n't have a magazine
0	so i 'm mostly with other folks on the content . if you get lucky , the small sampling of product reviews will include some item you 're looking at ( or should ) , and the anemic review will prompt you to follow up at the manufacturers website . the `` buyer 's guide '' was of decent breadth and useless depth on the bikes . no bikes from gary fisher , the inventor of mountain biking . huh ? i 'm primarily interested in mtb and the issues of mountain bike are good . but , you only get 4 issues , and the content is redundant between the two magazines ( or even within each mag ) . for instance , the may mtb issue had a story on rebuilding trails in los alamos ( i actually really like their reviews of specific places ) , and the cover also boasted a `` great american trail guide . '' one of the four trails talked about in this `` great american..guide '' : los alamos . i can spot a cut and paste job when i see one . also in that issue `` the bike that started a revolution '' about the sp stumpjumper . a great idea for an interesting article that was butchered into a condescending comic strip . also , having ordered the mag for the issues of mtb , i was disappointed when they did n't even show up . emails with customer service resulted in one of the more disappointing `` did you not read my email '' type exchanges . two months later , and i now have one of the two missing issues in hand . they have great photography , and i have yet to find a better option , but i 'm really disappointed . i wo n't renew
1	i have been a long time subscriber to vogue knitting , it was one of the few us knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns . i am from germany , where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns , i missed that when i moved to the us . however , i find that the content in vogue knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs , sometimes , it was just too far out and there was n't a single pattern i wanted to knit . i stopped my subscription for a while . then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky , yet still chic and fun . i still enjoy reading it every once in a while . after having my daughter , i changed my subscription to family circle easy knitting , since vogue knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids , which i really find a shame . i even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission . especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them ! the german magazines do a great job of having some unique , but still fun kids designs . if you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns ( some very expensive ) , then vogue knitting is the magazine for you . if you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional , but still challenging , i would suggest interweave knits and rebecca ( english version of a german magazine ) , both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns . if you have kids , there is n't much out there , i would suggest family circle easy knitting , also rebecca does a kids issue once a year , which should not be missed
1	this is not the kind of magazine you read , at least not cover to cover . this is for serious shopping , or shopping ideas . feel a whole in your wardrobe ? lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges . that is one of the reasons i really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look . it also gives great website types , which is very helpful when your stuck out in the middle of the continent . the `` everyday girl '' advice on mixing and maxing is often lacking , but the magazine makes up for it with pages of clothing , shoes , etc . devoted to shopping , pick this up
1	go into high gear man ! great business mag ! what you do not know you will know , if you buy this mag . read on man !
1	i have been reading this magazine for years . i love the tips and enjoy looking at what is `` fashionable '' at the time . i recommend this magazine !
0	! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! dont buy ! ! ! ! nuff sai
1	i love w magazine in all its oversized glory . its frothy with articles for the affluent , gorgeous photography , celebrity interviews and other frothy delights . it aims for the affluent and its unabashed in doing so . its amusing that certain people review on amazon.com with their personal rants that have nothing to do with the product at all . if anyone works hard for their success then why should they be abashed for enjoying the good life and beautiful things ? its these people that w addresses , and its frothy and i 'm going to enjoy it for all its frothiness
1	i ordered this magazne when my daughter was between 8-11 . the whole family enjoyed the informative issues . my daughter is in high school now , so we no longer get the magazine . when my 2 young kids are around 8 or so , i ca n't wait to order the magazine again . detailed photos along with the articles make it very attractive to students . i never had any billing issues and highly recommend this magazine
0	i started reading this magazine because i needed something to read , but i stopped right away . thr articles are pointless , because you can buy another magazine and see the same information , and same with the pictures . the editors of this magazine put exclamation points basically after every single sentence , none of which were exciting at all . maybe i just hate pop star ! just because i do n't care for celebrity magazines . or maybe not . but the only people i would recommend this magazine to is children under 10 years of age
0	if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would . when vibe was introduced , it was a relevant , interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative , r and hip hop artists . the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who 's hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world . lately i 've noticed that it 's nothing more than a fluffy version of the source . i hate a lot of new rap music that 's out and did n't appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover . and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over , all of the female r singers ' covers and stories are horrible ( we wo n't even discuss that disgusting brandy cover ) ! this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i 'm in line at the grocery store . yes , the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking . i 'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription
0	if you are into high brow interior design then this is for you . but my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at veranda and the subscription department 's ability to read . they are by far the worst
1	loved this magazine . they had such great articles and tips that saved my sanity ! loved it and highly recommend it
1	i was sceptical at first . but after getting a few of the magazines i really got into the way they looked at the whole body health and did n't just focus on `` body '' exercises like most magazines
1	there are precious few magazines out there for the military historian with the appeal that this one has . the illustrations are stunning and complement the well-written and informative text month after month . one of my favorite magazines and a must-have for the military historian
1	as a potential interior designer , i find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest . i have a subscription and i find that studying the designers , the styles and the themes i have learned so much about the work of a designer . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color , fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors
0	forbes is a great magazine . amazon on the other hand , well they ought to get out of the magazine business . order said first issue would be in february . amazon `` forgot '' , to place the order until i called in april to find out what happened . now they claim the first issue will be june 19 . yeah right . funny how they do n't forget to charge the credit card you place the order . do n't order magazines from amazon
1	i enjoy the vibe of this magazine.the q 's are truly interesting to me to say the least overall.very entertaining has a up-front vibe on things.not like other magazines that is for sure
1	i am still a college students with no children . i got this magazine because i absolutly love children . a while back one of the readers suggested taking peices you think will be important and putting them in a scrapbook based on the age of your unborn baby . i love this idea and this magazine is the perfect one to do this with
1	he 's been in the rock business a long time , serving as chief editor/founder of bar , bible review and archaeology odyssey ; he is also president of biblical archaeology society among many other ventures . i 've read his understanding the dead sea scrolls which he mainly edited , although he wrote a few articles himself . this is a magazine of substance , one i would love to have a subscription to . the issue of july/august 2004 has an interesting article/interview that mr. shanks orchestrated between elie wiesel and frank moore cross , the subject being how they understood , approached , studied the bible , from their perspective , which their lifes ' work ultimately revolves around . one , f.m . cross , comes from a presbyterian , academic background , the other , wiesel , a jewish one . frank moore cross contributed several articles to understanding the dead sea scrolls . he was the only protestant to work on the scrolls among the original team of 7 other people , six of whom were catholic clerics ; he is an expert in this field . and i just love wiesel 's mind , i love how he writes and thinks . that one article , i think is really illuminating , showing how rich in teaching the bible is regardless of its many detractors , or fumbling misinterpreters . it is , as i 've been taught in sunday school , g-d breathed , it 's g-d 's words , it is a living text even if it contains mostly stories of people long since dead and gone . elie wiesel says of it : `` wherever you open it , any page , you know that you are in the presence of something that exists nowhere else . '' the moral of the article is neither approach , wiesel 's or cross ' , toward scripture is wrong , it just simply reflects the richness , the variety of the text
1	ordered this for my son . sometimes it takes a while , for the order to reach him in prison , so i 'm not sure he has received it yet . since you wrote and reminded me , i 'm thinking it did get to him , as others have been returned
1	when i was little , my dad always said good things about this magazine . my attitude was always `` i 'm not gon na buy a magazine to bore myself some more '' - i mean , c'mon , it 's a history magazine . i was absolutely wrong . i picked up this magazine one day and i was hooked . i would say that american heritage has found its way to make history interesting . one way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest ( as subtle as they may be ) into its articles . on the second thought , i should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he 's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not . this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so that i could finish my copy in one sitting . it 's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months . american heritage makes history grrreattt ! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20 's like myself
0	i 'm very disappointed with this magazine . it seems to be a total waste of money . i found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2-3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas , but it 's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something i can use .
1	while many mainstream publications have been shying away from calling members of the current american government into account for their transgressions - from bribery and theft to misinformation and cover-ups of sexual escapades - `` the nation '' has done its job and reported the facts . for its trouble , many of those who lean the same way as the current administration lambast the magazine as `` too liberal '' and `` naively progressive . '' so let 's put it this way : if you value truth over lies and think the rights of `` the little guy '' are just as important as the rights of fat cats , you will like `` the nation . '' but be warned -- `` the nation '' is rife with page after thorough page of intense reporters ' writings , and even some clever poetry , but only rarely has pictures . which may be the real reason why right wingers do n't like it
1	i 've been to a lot of concerts , met a lot of bands , seen a lot of hype , seen a lot of scandal . this magazine is pretty much the best source of any up-and-coming band that you may be hearing on the radio or seeing on mtv . not only is spin the best magazine for music for `` kids my age ( 22 ) '' but the picture quality is some of the best quality that i have seen in any magazine . i have framed pages out of previous spin magazines , because they were pictures i wanted to keep forever . i would recommend spin magazine to any fan of indie rock especially . death cab for cutie , the shins , and the flamming lips are just some of the bands that are talked about in spin magazine monthly . spin magazine does include some rap/hip-hop music that i try to avoid but the indie-rock and rock band information that i receive is some of the best .
1	i 've been reading foreign affairs since 1980 and have always admired the well rounded scope covering everything from social cultural issues , media/public opinion , international law , human rights , economics , trade finance , science technology , intelligence , energy , resources environment , international organizations , and the list goes on . what i love most about this journal is that there is no agenda - the journalism is highly ethical and thorough . you 'll also find out about great new books . i 've loved and studied international relations since 1980 , and this is the one magazine that has never let me down . its coverage is the pinnacle in print journalism . deserves 10 stars !
0	i still have not received this magazine , what is taking so long ! !
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give . this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up . too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out - every 10 year old 's top priority right ? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue - magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span . better off with american girl magazine - this one 's to mature for younger girls .
0	i never received this product so i can not review it . i ordered it through amazon.com and they never sent the magazine . do not order magazines through amazon.com . i called customer service and being re-routed several times i finally spoke to a customer service agent who said the magazine is on its way . that was two weeks ago and i still have not received any copies of the magazine . do not order through amazon.com . order all magazines directly through the publisher or any other way . amazon.com was a terrible experience . if i ever recieve the magazine i am sure the first issue will show that i started receiving the magazine at the order date so i will have to fight with them to have my subscription end with the my first delivered magazine
1	i agree that this magazine boasts designer clothing with extremely high prices that most people can not afford , but may people be aware that this magazine is called `` teen vogue '' and obviously will follow in it 's big sister 's footsteps . `` vogue '' does not feature clothes from walmart , and so `` teen vogue '' will not either . this magazine does not necessarily cater to only rich people . who says that a person should only buy a magazine when she is going to get the exact clothes featured in it ? i am definitely no millionaire . i 'm 16 years old and still in high school , but i enjoy this magazine immensely.of course i dont slip out to marc jacobs when i 'm done reading and get myself the shirt on page 79 , but i do look at the styles so i can understand the new trends and just inspire myself some . magazines dont always have to be realistic . fashion is about pursuing beauty and covetting beauty , and if all magazines only featured `` affordable clothes ' from walmart and old navy , well.. i really wouldnt know what that would be like . `` teen vogue '' is a pure fashion magazine . it isnt an all-round magazine for young girls . it 's only fashion . and it does a great job at what it strives for . the fashion is great and the taste is great , the shoots are amazing . a former reviewer reccomended `` seventeen '' and i want to note that `` seventeen '' is a different type of magazine entirely . seventeen is extremely mainstream bubblegum and is not very fashion orientated . personally i do not like that magazine but i 'm not going to condemn it here . `` teen vogue '' is classy , stylish , and lives up to it 's name . you dont have to be a rich kid to read this magazine . but it 's the only teen magazine out there which is dedicated souly to high fashion and yes , features the best fashion . people who are not interested in fashion will probably hate this magazine , and that is probably why it has recieved so much criticism . i , on the other hand , love this magazine . the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the reviews above deemed the stuff in it affordable for young girls and that does strike me as ridiculous . otherwise , look to this magazine for some fantastic fashion inspiration
1	i have read vanity fair for the past twenty years . the articles are timely and in depth . there are articles on politicians , bankers , ceos as well as the hollywood types . this is the magazine for those who want to be in the know . also , the photographs are fantastic . if you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress/actor of the hour , this is not the magazine for you .
1	wonderful magazine ! the receipes are excellent , i have tried several and they are all keepers ! they are tasty , low calorie , high fiber etc . the format of the magazine is great and there interesting articles as well as recipes
0	the articles are `` good '' but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point . too many annoying ads . if u want something to `` read '' this isnt the magazine for yo
0	i decided that i had to write a review about newsweek this morning , after i came across yet another biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one is entitled , `` rethinking the marriage crunch , '' and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman 's chances of getting married later in life . this was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around , and neglected to have any on this occasion . i really think another reviewer 's comparison to people is quite apt , but newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue . two years ago , we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning `` infidelity chic . '' yes , it seems , according to their sources , spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue , without even a hint of contradiction , that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before . i find the magazine to be [ ... ] as they offer opinion instead of news ; theirs is a mission of persuasion . overall , there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool .
0	the writing seems to have come from under-educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool . i was n't sure if i was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles . this magazine is n't for men , it 's for boys . however , the one star is for the photos of the women which , we ca n't deny , both men and boys can appreciate
1	instyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible . the features are very informative and fun . i enjoy the man of style feature and the entertaining guide best ! for more on mags , visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com
0	i 'm so glad we did n't buy a subscription to national geographic kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first ! it truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual content in this magazine . if you 're looking for a good kids ' magazine about nature wildlife , try one of the national wildlife federation 's excellent publications . my kids enjoy your big backyard ( for ages 3-7 ) and ranger rick ( for kids 7 up ) , both of which are available through amazon.com or [ ... ] kids discover magazine ( for 6-12 year olds ) is another favorite with my children ( and me ) and contains great science social studies articles without the commercials of ng kids . you can subscribe through amazon or [ ...
0	2 months after ordering , i have year to get my first issue . i 'm sure i 'll like it ... if i ever get it
0	i 've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and i 've loved getting this , but it has undergone changes recently and not for the better . specifically , i hate what they 've done to the graphical design inside . whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about , now they 've adopted a uniform style where nearly everything looks the same . it looked better before . the writing is n't as witty or sharp ( have longtime staff departed ? ) , and there are `` filler '' pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply do n't work . the strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics , especially the movie and dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i 'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos i do n't let my mailbox fill with crap like this
0	ca n't give a review on maximum pc . never received the magazine . instead i was sent the men 's magazine fhm . please send my maximum pc
1	national geographic traveler brings content rich information about the locations covered , the culture of the people , places to stay for many budgets , along with breathtaking photography that makes me want to leap right into the pages . national geographic also has excellent travel packages ( i prefer land , no cruises for me ) to destinations rich in archeology , history , ancient culture , as well as newer destinations with respect to where to stay . if you love seeing the beauty of our planet , this great magazine will definitely help you make your decisions a lot easier ! barbara rose , ph.d. author of if god hears me , i want an answer and stop being the string along
1	this is the first time i have subscribed to this magazine . i really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles .
1	to those of you who are sceptable concerning british car magazines , as an enthusiast i must say british magazines are plain better than american automotive magazines , maybe in exception to car and driver . but evo magazine is easily the best of them . no one can match evo 's articles , stories , comparisons , special cover stories ( such as performance car of the year and trackday car of the year ) , photography that no one else can match , and everything else you 'd want from an automotive magazine . in short , evo magazine is brilliant . my only complaints is that their acceleration times are almost always about 1/2 second off ( which is an extremely small problem , a problem that is forgiven by everything else that is given in this magazine ) and a price tag that is higher than any other i 've seen . buying from america , i spend about $ 10 per issue , but let me tell you , it 's worth it . no doubt evo is the best automotive magazine out there , and it is worth the money . well ... only if you 're very interested in cars . just do n't expect to find any rednecks in their 4x4s in the mud
0	when you subscribe to the wall street journal it 's like getting two newspapers : a good news reporting paper and an what at times seems like an editorial page written by sophmomores in the local young americans for freedom college rag . it 's not that i mind right-wing editorials , i 'm somewhat of a libertarian myself , it 's just that its editorial page puts ideology ahead of reason far too often for my taste . for a much better deal -- business news , all the financial quotes , much better international coverage , and excellent and concise reporting -- choose the financial times . at the moment an annual subscription is selling for $ 50 . it 's a much better publication and on saturday 's has a very fine weekend section with good book reviews and arts and culture coverage . also because the ft is based out of london the editors are much more balanced and less cowed or ideologically obedient . even if they were similarly priced the ft would be the better deal . as it is the ft costs a fraction of the price of the wsj .
1	a must read ! ! this magazine gives you the most up to date information on the powerlifting circuit . gives great lifting and fitness tips to boot ! ! ! this magazine should have main stream publication and distribution
1	i love these magazines . we subscribe to ladybug , spider , and cricket ( each for a different child ) . the stories are great , as is the illustration . an illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines , and i figure it is the same for the stories . no advertising , of course . the thing i like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child . highlights tries to be something for everyone , so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story . in ladybug , we just start at the beginning and read straight through . as the publisher will tell you , when your child outgrows ladybug , you just let them know and they change your subscription to spider ( and later , cricket . that 's as far as we 've gotten )
1	this is a great foodie magazine . we think the writing is what makes it great . it is always interesting , has some recipes to try and is not the usual food mag stuff . very enjoyable
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there , but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous . i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90:10 . it still has wonderful fashion tips , but the ads are becoming burdonsome . in style has replaced vogue as my # 1 fashion mag , but i 'll always be a vogue reader
1	this is a great mag full of interesting story 's and poem's.i have been getting this mag for about a year know and at the end of the month i ca n't wait to get cricket.i also like it because it doese n't have any adds.it has great fantasy and history story 's . you should try this great magazine
1	the magazine was shipped in a timely manner , i would use this vendor again
0	this magazine used to be thick , fun to read , full of information . but that was about 5 years ago . now it 's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense . the editorial is almost always filled with political opinions . i wo n't renew my subscription
1	the american spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual . not only are the articles witty and well-researched , they also provide well-articulated arguments to the most pressing ( if sometimes slighlty out of date ) controversies of the times . well worth the subscription price , or even the cover price
0	i found cat fancy magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners . i 'm also very unimpressed with their cat channel online board they advertise in cat fancy and can not recommend it to others . they seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it . also cat fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine , but if you go onto amazon , you can get a renewal rate of almost half the cat fancy renewal price . so i have come to the conclusion that between the cat fancy magazine , their poor online cat channel board and the high renewal rate cat fancy charges , they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members .
0	wired magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine : that there is a level of cynical , style-whoring , inaccurate , myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely `` trading substance for style . '' wired is consistently behind the curve these days , but that does n't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know . in articles about controversial subjects , one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that i find them offensive even when i disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall . just as often , features which do n't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them , making fun of a person , group , or idea in a way that is n't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted by the subject matter . generally , wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and it industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst , desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths , shoddy reasoning , and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . is n't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin , double-talk , and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent , absurd bravado of battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize for technology 's promise and educate about its current and future potential . instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for `` hip '' that forwards an attitude rather than a message , with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy , having more in common with advertising than edification
1	mind , body spirt fitness magazine is wonderful . i get a lot of exercise ideas from them and i try to incorparate them into my workouts for my clients in chicago . thanks fitnes
0	new york magazine 's articles and advertisements are too risque , always pushing the envelope . thanks , but no thanks
0	i have enjoyed reading family fun magazine , but unfortunately have only received 2 issues . i have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service . i will not order another magazine from amazon because of this poor service . i tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around .
0	i subscribed in sept 04 and still have not received any single issue ( as of jan 05 ) . there is no phone number or email address , so the only way to contact them is by mail , only they do n't respond . they took my money , and i never heard from them again . finally i had enough and subscribed to garden gate magazine instead . they are prompt and efficient , and the magazine is great
0	this magazine was given to us as a gift subscription when our son was born , but both my wife and i quickly tired of it . the previous review that pointed out their lack of scientific research in a good bulk of their advice and their tendency to misquote and distort studies is just plain irresponsible . the magazine seems to be firmly stuck in a fantasy 'pc ' world of lofty goals and ideals for your children that have very little real world application . articles about disciplining your children that read along the lines of 'if your 2 year old hits his brothe rin the face with a soccer ball , look him straight in the face , make eye contact and tell him that it is not nice to hit ' . thanks for that pearl of wisdom . anyone with a 2 year old can atest to the futility of reasoning with them . never would parents magazine advocate something that might actually work like say taking all of his toys away and marching his butt to the corner where he gets to stand for say 9 years or until he is adopted by the neighbors : ) seriously , the magazine writes for a fantasy land scenario where june and ward are the parents and the kids act like the munchkins on a disney tv movie . if you happen to be the cleavers , go for it..
1	i 've actually met people who have said , `` i 'm too old to learn new things . '' and younger folk who have said , `` that 's too much like being in class . '' if you 're one of these people , do n't bother with mental floss magazine , or with going to school any more , or for that matter , with continuing to be alive in the first place . living is learning , and this magazine helps edify and entertain you while you 're doing all that living and learning . most highly recommended . but if you like staying stupid , you 're probably not reading this . carry on , then . p.s . to the person who complained that the editors correct their previous mistakes and clarify their obfuscations in each issue : you 'd prefer the wide variety of publications and tv `` news '' shows which do n't ever acknowledge human error ? good luck with that
0	more and more , all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like , and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure , and if you indulge in such a thing , you are 'shallow ' . music has evolved past this attitude , and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore . and oh yeah , their politics is so mixed up , they do n't even know what they believe anymore . i was a subscriber for eleven years , my renewal notice came , and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in
0	i 've read many positive reviews of this magazine and i did receive , several months ago , a trial issue . after sending in the subscription fee , i was billed again . i wrote a note letting them know that the check had been endorsed and deposited . yesterday , i got a notice telling me my subscription had expired after one issue . i give up . it might be good , but customer service is really lousy . what a disappointment .
1	i love this magazine and i look forward to getting it in the mail every single week , unless if the last one was a double issue . then i have to wait another whole week , which can sometimes be painful . i love the reviews and the magazine is funny , fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies , tv , music , and dvds . the onlt complaint i have is lately they do n't have as many reviews for urban releases
1	this is the best business and money magazine out there . they cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you did n't think of .
0	this magazine reads like an inflight magazine : something airlines , careful to not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out to lull their readers to sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . do n't you wish someone out there would publish a really good magazine about books ? one that featured meaty stories and well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ai n't it . it is dull and bland . occasionally it offers up a conservative book review by neocon writer catherine seipp , who is about as enlightening as bill o'reilly ( that is , entertaining and offensive and laughably stupid ) so this can sometimes cut the dull . but someone here said bland and i agree . avoid this one if you have an iq above 90 . pick up the new yorker , the atlantic monthly or harper 's if you like to read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries and other badly written pieces of fluff -- which is all this magazine covers -- this might just be the thing for you . i want my money back
0	truth-be-told , i hated `` having '' to give this magazine even one star , but that was the least i could do via this rating system . this magazine has some good writers but needs a new editor . mr. shoaf is very bad at his job , clearly , and seems to use and reuse the `` buddy system '' in using writers . perhaps he gets a kickback ? at any rate , this is , overall , a cruddy example of journalism . my facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction in many issues . i am done with it . get a new editor and perhaps i will reinvestigate the publication . until then , so long . i have no time for absolute rubbish
1	yes , the magazine is great ... but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads . they will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters . and occasionally , you get a big stinky aol disk in with your issue . kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios . welcome to the mainstream media
0	this used to be a pretty decent music magazine . not the best that was out there , but still decent . however , rolling stone has taken a huge nose-dive in the past ten or so years . i 'm not sure i 'd even really call it a music magazine anymore . it 's more a pop-culture magazine that panders to teeny-boppers . a music magazine 's main focus should be music , but rs has over the years started including more and more articles on tv shows , movies , politics , etc and less and less on music ... especially less and less on good music . if you want a magazine on pop-culture go with entertainment weekly . it , at least , has a bit of taste here and there and does n't spout off about politics . if i want politics , i 'll read the newspaper or watch cnn . i do n't buy music magazines for politics . i buy them for music . if you want a good music magazine , this is n't the place to look anymore .
0	my subscription was for a year . but the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired . i would suggest people subscribe to good housekeeping directly instead
1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nast traveler , and i 'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire . this magazine has articles about places not about ( as one other reviewer wrote ) articles about martinis , fashion etc . it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers . it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one
0	i do n't know what the heck is going on with your subscription service . i bought this magazine for my nephew back on july 9th , and he still has n't recieved an issue ! ! ! ! i am extremely disappointed with your service . it should not take this long to get a magazine
0	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it , not for some guilt ridden , agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics ( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate ) is something we should all read about at nauseum . when they stick to music , it 's good , when they parade their shreiking political views , it 's boring .
1	this is the sencond time i renew my subscription , i really enjoy this magazine , i know it all my life , because my mam had been used for as long i remmenber .
0	at one time , southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas . over the past few years , it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food , in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook . only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now . we can not speak to its information on gardening , just the cooking part . if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living , we would have cancelled this long ago . if you are a serious cook , get the cookbooks from years ago . the current magazine is well beneath you
1	ok , the advertisements are a bit much , but the magazine is great . my son has subscriptions to cricket and kids discover , too . he has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years , and this one stands out to me because , unprompted , he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing . this magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all . the magazine format is easy to read , yet rich in content
1	both of our grandsons love getting si for kids . it is a great way to introduce them to reading for fun
1	after subscribing to natural health for years , the magazine recently `` went to the dogs '' . i now subscribe to alternative medicine instead and it is like natural health used to be . i love it . the information is accurate and the topics are all very interesting
1	american photo has an indepth look at alot of various subjects . there are some photos of real life situations experiences . the latest issue depicted the iraq war situation , how some of the soldiers iraqi civilians are coping with what 's going on around them . the magazine also has alot more close-up detailed photo 's , so even the amateur photographer can enjoy it . i have been a subscriber to american photo for many years probably will continue to subscribe for as long as the magazine is in existence , or the rest of my life , whichever comes first . i collect each every issue . i love america photo ! ! ! !
1	touchstone features articles , editorials , book reviews and other material from the perspective of protestant ( both mainline and evangelical ) , catholic and orthodox christians who hold to traditional , orthodox understandings of christian morality . it tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-christian culture . while it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost ( see the july/august 2003 issue on `` christian unity the divisions we must sustain '' ) , it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree . the publisher , the st. james fellowship , also produces an excellent devotional guide : the st. james daily devotional guide for the christian year , available by subscription though [ ... ]
1	this magazine is great . my daughter and i are doing projects together out of it every issue . it 's great also because it is training us to be creative on our own , and to try new things . we also do these singing lesson cds together- vice lessons to go by vaccarino- really fun , and have been doing berlitz beginning spanish cds together . we love choices beyond sitting and watching tv
0	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies . filled with poorly-written articles . i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine . it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , and no i 'm not talking about the advertisements , but the actual articles themselves . the magazine is not a news magazine , it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in . if you like paying for ads , go for it
0	recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and i could n't believe my eyes . the magazine is a skeleton of its former self , with slim stories and little science . bob guccione jr 's mag is not even that fun to read . on the happier side , the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations
1	we are very happy with how quickly our fiest issue arrived . we ordered on 1-25-06 and our first issue arrived 2-24-06 ( almost a month earlier than anticipated ! )
0	do not ! ! order from this website ! i purchased a subscription for oxygen magazine on jan. 30 , 2006 , and i still have not received the first issue . i am very dissapointed , to say the least !
1	cemetery dance magazine is a world fantasy award winning magazine of horror , published bi-monthly , featuring short stories of horror and dark suspense , interviews with outstanding talent , and reviews galore . there is no shortage of opinions where products are concerned , with somewhere around forty-five reviews in every issue , including articles by writers bev vincent , michael marano , thomas f. monteleone , paula guran , steve vernon , john pelan , hank wagner , rick kleffel , william p. simmons , the list goes on and on . writer robert morrish is the editor , mindy jarusek the managing editor . the publisher and executive editor is richard chizmar , who has edited and published some chilling anthologies under the titles shivers i , ii , iii , and iv , featuring tales by top names in the genre , top names who know a thing or two about scaring people . cemetery dance magazine not only inspires `` the creeps '' in this reader , but also keeps me informed about new book releases , and other magazines in the genre . if you like your horror ranging anywhere from gonzo to literate , you will like cemetery dance magazine .
1	i was really pleased when i recieved my first issue . i was n't sure what to expect from this magazine , but it was wonderful . the design and layout are so much more interesting than other magazines , that alone makes it a joy to look at . the articles are so great , and really offer insight into living a more `` natural '' lifestyle in the home . i am really happy that someone has put together this resource , because it can be diffucult to find good information on natural products and alternative housing . i was very inspired by the stories about building straw bale homes and ca n't wait to see more . i wished the magazine was longer so they could show more photos and insights . this is really a great resource for the eco-minded .
0	as a professional photographer , i think the organization that publishers this magazine has truly lost their way . the images are predictable and unimaginative and have n't changed in the past 25 years . there are much better magazines to read
1	if you are a guy that loves some sexy women of your dreams , cop this magazine . you might even want to get a 2 year subscription . this magazine is full of of sex full figured queens and you can almost bet that the cover girl will always make your heart beat faster and make your mouth water . long live the king ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	first off , most people do n't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they do n't have but desperately want -- at least , i do n't . this magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time . is n't our home supposed to be a haven ? someplace to return to from the hustle , bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love . this magazine simply caters to people with that ethic . it 's always full of ideas -- both trendy and traditional . it 's not full of `` buy , buy , buy ! '' hyper-consumerist propoganda -- it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun . anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect does n't turn to home magazines looking to be led , like a sheep , into the latest buying frenzy . most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever , inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives -- on our own budget . this magazine is always full of beautiful pictures , great advice , and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains . mainly , though , it 's about making the most of what you 've got , and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest . do n't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review . this magazine is worth every penny
1	this magazine is published every month . for me it 's a big event . i ca n't wait to finger though the pages , look at the articles , and read the columns from my favorite writers like molly ivans . if you are a conservative this magazine is not for you but if you are a moderate , or some where on the left you will love this magazine ! senator robert lafollette r-wi originally founded it . he ran for president in 1924 under the progressive party ( which has since died out ) . he received 4,826,471 popular votes and 13 electoral votes . it was one of the first publications ever to publish the writings of martian luther king and has since been a strong voice against the war in iraq . this magazine should be cherished for being well progressive .
0	like `` where 's waldo '' , it seems every issue must have at least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this is admitedly a classic piece of furniture , one gets the impression that there are a gaggle of designers telling their clients , `` you have to have one of these , they 're what 's in ! '' most of the features in metropolitan home suffer from the same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes with the same dreary interiors that obviously were foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients by designers who know how to make an easy buck . `` modern '' equals , of course , a mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up in this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month of 1970 's florals , faux louis the whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through the dreck and finding something useable for your own purposes , it 's painful to look through this magazine . if you really want ideas for making your house reflect you , trust yourself and what you like , and if you do like mies van der rohe daybeds , by all means get one . just do n't plunk one in your sun room because you were told it 's trendy . if you like the modern style , look up the works of hans wegner and peter hvidt and go from there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years of hard use by real families and is sturdy as well . maybe you want a house where nobody is allowed to set foot in any of the rooms and amounts to a bad hodge-podge of styles that all seem a bit busy and bumpy . for everyone else , think about the things you 'd like to see if you walked into a room , save your money and skip this magazine
0	sure i like a mystery- who does n't ? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story . the tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance . we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment . the value for money is horrible , the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- alfred hitchcock would not be proud
1	woman 's day is a good resource for women . it covers a variety of topics , including health/beauty , diet/exercise , relationships , children . there are tips for getting organized , recipes , crafts and decorating tips also . there 's a tip a day calendar as well as a day to day meal planner . it relies heavily on reader 's tips which are scattered through the magazine and in the various articles . each issue tells you how to join the woman 's day readers panel to submit tips and maybe win a prize . and even if you do n't want to join the reader 's panel , there are plenty of other prizes given away by woman 's day . woman 's day is well worth subscribing to !
0	i ordered how for a graphic designer friend 's birthday in january and it is near the end of march and she still has not received anything ... so we have no idea how the product is ... we have not seen it
0	the magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up ... it is not . an 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes , being sexually active and kissing . i am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate
1	good magazine for the married over 50 group , which represents 90.5 % of the retired travelers
0	i began subscribing to gourmet in 1961 , and continued to subscribe for about forty years . i also gifted family members with subscriprions . i discontinued my subscription because the magazine has deteriorated so much in the last several years : there are so many ads and tear-outs in the magazine that one can hardly find the recipes , at least half of the magazine , and sometimes more ; also i object to the `` political , '' and some downright offensive , articles . i am catholic , and i was very offended by an outrageous article charging that , during the nazi era , naked jews were made to crawl through the streets on their knees by persons , which the article linked in some way to the catholic church . i think that the information was apochryphal ; and , what does this have to do with food ?
1	came right away and in a timely fashion every two weeks ! great product for a wonderful price ! loved it
0	i made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen . i received a very good offer to subscribe , that i did n't want to turn down . i thought this was going to be like a better homes and gardens , or country living but it was n't . this appears to be a good choice for design professionals . i was just not very impressed
0	big publication . little unique coverage . the mag is very repetitive and lacking . almost no womens coverage . gee , are they not very hard working cycling athletes as well ? the same big name riders are always mentioned . definetly a us publication , not covering an international sport . may have done more harm than good to cycling with the covers and article structure in 2005 having a lopsided , somewhat sensationalized , view of the doping issue . i would n't subscribe again . there are too many other good to excellent choices available
0	i certainly do hope one of these days that maxim magazing will get women who are small-breasted equal time . that 's all i have to say
0	laptop magazine focuses on laptops , pdas , and wireless computing . laptop magazine seems like it 's trying to be both technical and exciting ; however it lacks the objectivity of pc magazine and the deep enthusiasm of wired . thus , it reads like a series of infomercials where each `` article '' paints a rose-colored view of each technology and the vendors products followed by paid ads of the same vendors portrayed so happily in the text . their conclusions all seem predetermined : new technology is better
0	the national enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency . to now attack a sweet , wonderful , charitable guy like clay aiken is very very sad . to go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing , but to go after a quiet humble guy like clay is another . and now what ? is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage . their story is ludicrous and they owe clay , his family , and all of his fans a big apology . i will not buy this filthy rag or any american media products ever again
1	i just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here . many try to sterotype the type of readers who like real simple , well i love this magazine- and did n't manage to fit into any of there categories . my aunt sent me this magazine and then i began to read it monthly , i enjoy the tips and sections like `` no time to clean ? , quick solutions for every room '' - yes they do have product suggestions , but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have . others have called this magazine- `` a slave to fashion '' , as a woman in her 20 's i would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information . overall i enjoy this magazine , as others have mentioned the recipes are great and i always find plenty of good tips . the photography and layout are amazing , i always use the old editions for reference or crafts
1	i actually make the recipes in this magazine . the recipes are simple but interesting . the nutritional information is also great . this is my favorite cooking magazine by far
0	okay , so in touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is : a glossy tabloid . but just when you did n't think it was possible for the american tabloid press to dumb down any further , along came in touch weekly and us weekly . all in touch really is is a bunch of photographs . their writing is slop , fit for second graders , and it does n't go into much detail ( and we all know how amazingly `` accurate '' these tabloids are , anyway ) . want a quality tabloid ? read hello ! magazine ( from england ) . - donna di giacom
1	i love evo and buy it every month . so why do n't i get a subscription ? because it still costs less to buy it at barnes and noble than to get a 12 month subscription ! this must be the only magazine that can claim a cheaper in-store price . what 's up with that
0	i subscribed to t+l for one year . my wife and i found the magazine to be uninformative and of little value when planning our travels . most of the magazine seems to be centered around places to go shopping and the photos that accompany the articles are artistic photos , usually of models wearing $ 1,000 outfits , instead of informative photos of the resorts or hotels . the recommended travel products tend to focus on $ 1,200 designer duffels which , while perhaps within reach of the target demographic , are unlikely to survive many trips through a major airport . in addition , my subscription came with an unrequested automatic renewal . i did n't enjoy the magazine and nearly every copy was in my recycle bin within 15 minutes of receiving it . however t+l decided that i would somehow like a renewal although i certainly never requested one . in my book , those are questionable and perhaps unethical business practices .
0	i 'm so glad we did n't buy a subscription to national geographic kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first ! it truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual content in this magazine . if you 're looking for a good kids ' magazine about nature wildlife , try one of the national wildlife federation 's excellent publications . my kids enjoy your big backyard ( for ages 3-7 ) and ranger rick ( for kids 7 up ) , both of which are available through amazon.com or [ ... ] kids discover magazine ( for 6-12 year olds ) is another favorite with my children ( and me ) and contains great science social studies articles without the commercials of ng kids . you can subscribe through amazon or [ ...
1	a great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on . i have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by editor jason sizemore 's growing tome to the darker side of sci-fi . with solid interviews and strong fiction by established pros like william f. nolan , ben bova , tom piccirilli , neil gaiman and brian keene and talented newcomers like bryn sparks , jenifer pelland , and eugie foster you ca n't miss with this one
0	american photo began as a magazine devoted more to photography than to gear , as an alternative to the gear obsessed magazines like pop photo and photographic . it has evolved into a magazine that divides its pages between equipment obsession and cheesy `` glamour '' photography that tries for art and delivers soft core porn . no stars
0	this was a gift for my daughter . instead of receiving the new yorker , she is receiving people . you need to fix this
1	woman 's day is a good resource for women . it covers a variety of topics , including health/beauty , diet/exercise , relationships , children . there are tips for getting organized , recipes , crafts and decorating tips also . there 's a tip a day calendar as well as a day to day meal planner . it relies heavily on reader 's tips which are scattered through the magazine and in the various articles . each issue tells you how to join the woman 's day readers panel to submit tips and maybe win a prize . and even if you do n't want to join the reader 's panel , there are plenty of other prizes given away by woman 's day . woman 's day is well worth subscribing to !
1	in the world of gaming , there are specialized magazines for each system ( playstation magazine , xbox mag , etc . ) , most of which suck because they only report on ( duh ) games on their respective systems . others , like electronic gaming monthly , encompass most systems but only do it half-assed , not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it . then , there 's gameinformer . there are many things that set gameinformer apart from many other `` gaming '' magazines : 1 ) they have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play . if the game sucks , they say so ; if it 's an awesome game , they 'll tell you about it . 2 ) matt helgeson ( senior gaming editor ) and the other editors actually inform you about the game 's most necessary attributes : its esrb rating ( e to m ) , their rating for the game ( from 1 to 10 ) , and a brief introduction to the game 's faults and successes . best of all , however , they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock . these are just some of the reasons that gameinformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market . i have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only , and i hope my review has explained why .
0	i used to really like us magazine . i have been collecting every issue each week for several years now . but wait ! has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year ? where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities , movies and music ? there 's no more than a thumbnail 's sketch of info on anything now . it 's all photos and quickie hype . it has no more substance . what happened to this good magazine
0	the weekly standard is just more of the same . it 's not , strictly speaking , journalism . but i imagine you 'd like it if you enjoy reading articles that set out to promote a very conservative point of view . if you like rush or fox news , you 'd probably like it . if you are looking for a serious media outlet , this is not it
1	a magazine my children love as much as i do ! ! ! we homeschool and love to plan lessons around all the fun articles and recommended activities . my children look forward to each and every copy . and guess what ? ? ? no ads ! !
0	i'de have never read vibe in the first place , but i won a free years subscription in some online contest . and i must also mention i 'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture , so i'de think vibe would be tight ... ..daamn , was i ever wrong . first off , half the mag is advertising ... .then what little reading there is ... .it 's all bullsh** . the interviews they have with artists are totally weak watered down . they never ask any worthwhile questions . vibe also contradicts itself constantly . in one issue , they 'll give an album a low rating a poor review , then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best ... .what the f*** ? vibe has it 's decent moments , but i def . wo n't be paying for it anytime soon .
1	i have been reading this magazine for years . i love the tips and enjoy looking at what is `` fashionable '' at the time . i recommend this magazine !
1	well the articles are much better then they are in maxim . these people have some sophistication . the women are a lot of naked and that is great plus they are increddibly hot . most of them are from europe which is awesome any way . i really do n't know why i gave it 4 stars because nothing holds it from a 5 sta
0	they may have some good info , but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore , and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads ... and within the ads a lot of scams and mlm schemes . buyer beware . :
0	we subscribed to this for a school fundraiser . the first issue came november 13 with many useful coupons , only they expired in october 2006 ! i wish i could get my money back on a useless magazine filled with alot of advertising . if you want a decent health magazine , try prevention . they have alot more to offer than this rag . save your money , i wish i had ! take the time to search around . i hope this saves someone from making the mistake i had
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think ... probably anywhere between 1.5-2.5 inches ... it contained ads , reviews , supplier lists , benchmarks and sometimes trial software ... well i have picked one up sense them ... and they are now a centimeter thick ( if your lucky ) they contain ... reviews that are well written or well read , and a whole lot of ads ... my conclusion do n't buy it ... if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world ... and if you want ads ... surf the internet
1	this is an excellent magazine . there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover . this is one of the few . the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right . they are gorgeous . the writing is clear and concise and interesting . the topics they write on include history , travel , historical objects , animals , places and so on . one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers . each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture important . they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed ( if it is a person ) . this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money . enjoy .
0	i have subscribed to `` in touch '' since september last year and it 's time to renew , but i 'm not goint to ... .because this megazine is never arrived on time ( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive ) , i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service . i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining .
1	american photo is a much better magazine than its sibling popular photography , but frankly , that is not saying much . it seems as though its primary market is fashion/glamour photographers since most of its issues are devoted to these aspects of professional photography . there are other magazines which excel at nature photography , so i am not disappointed by its absence here , but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy is a major omission which i hope this magazine does address eventually . there are also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written by working professionals , as opposed solely to in-house technical equipment overviews . american photo is without question among the better photo magazines currently available , but unless you are interested mainly in fashion and glamour photography , you might wish to look more closely at shutterbug or other magazines devote to nature and fine art photography
1	i ordered this magazine for my husband and he ca n't wait to get each issue ! he especially loves the free cd dvd that come with each issue . he 's heard alot of cool , new music and read up alot on some of his favorite bands
0	i have yet to receive my first issue of cat fancy ... ... .who do i contact to correct this problem ? ?
0	i ordered a subscription for my step-son and a gift for a niece at the same time . they took my money and both of the one-year subscriptions i paid for only resulted in one issue to each child . i could n't get any more information on the magazine , as we never received any more informaiton until i got an e-mail from amazon asking me to renew . i noticed another recent post with the same problem . the magazine was really great , and my step-son and niece both waited and waited for their next issue which never showed . how disappointing . i would n't take the chance if i were you . ld
1	okay , yeah , it 's no `` vogue '' or `` cosmo , '' but `` glamour '' is a lot more accessible to the `` everyperson '' than the other two . not all of us have glamourous pagegirl jobs that ( miraculously ) pay six figures . seriously -- secretaries in prada ? as if ! so glamour is a little more realistic , and a little more fun . and a lot less expensive . it 's a fun , `` cheap , '' guilty pleasure
0	i was looking forward to a magazine that took a good look at different subjects than those covered in the mainstream media . what i received was a manual on how to think the `` right '' way . i 've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself , but i vaguely considered myself a liberal . man , was i wrong . clearly , liberal means much the same as the demonized `` conservative '' . this magazine has a single viewpoint , that of an ultraliberal ex-hippie who has found themselves wealthy in the 21st century . it is full of articles about `` finding meaning '' and `` reassessing life '' that seem to have been written by folks who drive chevy suburbans and pay too much for a cup of coffee . the magazine gives off a strong smell of covert superiority , and it made me nauseous
1	running times , true to its roots , is focused on performance . worth the price alone for pete pfitzinger 's lab report series and the owner 's manual sections . if you want to be a better runner at any level , this magazine is invaluable . if you want to understand physiology and kinesiology , you 'll find no other resource like running times . and if you are interested in the sport of running , the stats and biographies are crucial and are a much needed spotlight on our sport 's heroes . like a true athlete , running times eschews junk and filler for focus
0	i ordered a subscription for my step-son and a gift for a niece at the same time . they took my money and both of the one-year subscriptions i paid for only resulted in one issue to each child . i could n't get any more information on the magazine , as we never received any more informaiton until i got an e-mail from amazon asking me to renew . i noticed another recent post with the same problem . the magazine was really great , and my step-son and niece both waited and waited for their next issue which never showed . how disappointing . i would n't take the chance if i were you . ld
1	i have been subscribing to this magazine for years , and it is a very special part of my weekly regimen . in fact , every monday or tuesday i start to feel a pang of something being 'missing ' if i have n't yet read that week 's issue . as i explained to my daughter this summer , i do not read every word , every page , or every article . but i do flip through every page and read whatever interests me or catches my attention . alot of it is just to look at the pictures and read the captions . every issue usually contains at least a few articles that i read in their entirety -- usually in the business and lifestyle sections -- and i often pick up tips on good books , music , and movies from it . a very solid subscription . a way of life , actually
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine , but no longer . ofcourse , there are too many adds ( but then , that 's what pays for the mag ) . i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles ( the hard hitting type ) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical . i buy elle for `` the fashion/beauty advice '' not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda . for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal , atlantic monthly , and watch fox news .
0	i have been reading this mag off and on for the past 20 years . as other reviews have said , i think i am just reading the same tired old stuff from three or four issues ago . `` big guns ! '' `` huge chest ! '' `` massive gains ! '' these seem to be the ones you 'll see featured about every other month in here . as for adds ? do n't get me started on adds ! when half of your magazine is adds , it spells trouble . not only that , they need to specify to people who may not already know , `` this mag 's training tips are for people who do not work for a living and can spend 6-8 hours a day in the gym , eat 8-10 meals a day and spend massive amounts of cash on supplements . '' in other words , people with no real responsibilities other than taking care of their physiques ( which as far as jobs go , that 's a great one to have ) . i teach all day and into the night , literally , for me to eat and train like they require , i 'd have to quit my day job , sell my kids into slavery , and become a homeless person . in which case i 'd have no money to have a gym membership . i think you get the idea . on the positive side , the photos are awe-inspiring . also , to be realistic , it 's a mag that has been around for decades upon decades . how many different ways can you say , `` lift heavy , eat like a horse , and train like you have no other responsibilities in life '' ? it just becomes repetitive any way you slice it . my recommendation would be to buy an issue or two every decade or so . buy january 's `` big guns '' issue , and then february 's `` huge chest '' . then wait a decade and repeat . good luck
1	as an aging,53 , appreciator of music , i find paste to be a welcome read every time it shows up in my mailbox.granted- i do not know every artist mentioned in the magazine nor do i care to , but the artists i do follow are treated with respect and with a sense of genuine interest ! the cd that comes with the magazine will help you decide beforehand whether or not to purchase that winterpills or eddie spaghetti cd ! as previously mentioned , in another review , the print can be small and my reading glasses are always nearby ! gre
0	i must say that i 've read just about every teen magazine on the market , and this is by far the worst one i 've ever read . however , at this point in my life , everything appears superficial and immature . i first picked up twist when it debuted on newsstands . i believe that was in august 1997 . i was nine then , and looking to be fashion forward among my girlfriends who were still into the jungle gym . because of my insane desire to be cool , and because twist was n't too hard for me to understand , i loved it and bought it religiously for about a year . my obsession with it slowly faded as the magazine got progressively worse and i did n't pick it up again ... ... until my junior year in high school . looking through a then-current issue of the magazine , i noticed that the way in which it was written was made to be comprehensible to a nine year-old , or the lowest common denomination of older teenage readers . what i 'm trying to say is this magazine is totally dumbed-down . it does n't give girls any credit for being able to think creatively , let alone read above a fourth-grade level . i also found the content to be more childish and superficial than other teen magazines ( although they are all superficial to an extent - that does n't mean they do n't make delightfully fun and entertaining reading to share with friends ) . therefore , i recommend this magazine to tweens ( 9-13 ) , and tweens only . but even they can do better than this magazine . older readers should check out the somewhat more sophisticated 'elle girl ' or 'cosmo girl ' , my two personal favorites . p.s . i agree with one of the other reviewers who pointed out the numerous spelling errors in the magazine . possibly my biggest caveat is the constant misuse of the apostrophe ( i.e . tuesday 's instead of tuesdays ) .
1	if you 're like me - middle-aged , white , male , conservative , christian , who buys most of my clothes at old navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article . and yet i find it very entertaining ! although i 'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits , and i 'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views , i find their articles interesting , well-written , and insightful . i must admit , i should hate esquire , because the editors and writers would find me disgusting . but somehow i look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month . the writers , if nothing else , are intelligent , which is more than i can say for the writers in most guy magazines like fhm and maxim
0	i first subscribed to gq when it was still a quarterly ... an issue only every 3 months . back then it was primarily a men 's fashion magazine . it was sophisticated , useful and classy filled with clothing men could actually wear and practical grooming tips , trends and style . i suppose in many ways it resembled a ralph lauren print ad . now fashion is relegated to a few pages in the back of the magazine with men wearing things they seem to have found at a local flea market . nothing seems to fit properly , patterns - plaids - stripes ... anything goes . it resembles homeless couture . odds and ends that nobody should actually wear . sure the world has changed . but fashion , good taste , and quality are timeless despite tweaking and contemporary preferences . the editors may feel that grunge , hopeless edginess for it 's own sake and adolescent sloppiness sell issues . but they might be surprised that there 's a huge pent up demand for sophistication and real style , both formal and relaxed . i hope someone else picks up the torch .
0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews . unlike the description included on the amazon website , the subsription does not include the cd-rom , which costs an additional $ 1/issue . and , if you want to purchase the cd-roms for past issues , they cost $ 4/disk . sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain . buyer beware
1	i love this magazine it helps me pick out a style when i need it
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money . thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else . but instead i 've paid and never received it . i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else , so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off . they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point , it 's been a couple months now
1	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew , who just loves it . it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it . now only if he would put it down so others can look at it
0	i was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas . it is n't really , and there is n't really that much to this magazine . it is just another tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked at the august and september issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on elton john 's out of africa fundraiser and the article on julian mcmahon . the rest of it was ads , and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in vogue magazine , but the same old ads you 'll see anywhere else , and they are annoying . there were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it `` plastic person syndrome '' ) mark consuelos , waay too much on jennifer garner and her baby , and other weird things , such as the trend of designer cupcakes . i wish i was kidding on the latter , but i am not , nor do i have $ 25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is jessica alba 's favorite . there was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here . despite the size of this magazine , there is very little to sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos of the same old same old , and tips for mimicking them . i am not interested in becoming a teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested in seeing vanessa carlton 's pad . this magazine is for you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , a subscription that is actually not a year ( it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine ) and your life 's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in new york because some celebrity did . this magazine is mediocre at best , and the worst part is , it has the exact same fashion advice as vogue . i went with vogue because there is substance in their magazine , and the ads are classy and very chic . leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at aol time warner .
0	kissinger , honorary chairman of the national interest , was going to head-up the 9/11 whitewash commission , but he begged off when families objected . dov zakheim , the 2.3 trillion dollar missing and unaccounted for pentagon funds man , is on the journal 's board . one is better off reading commentary magazine , where at least the `` neocon fascist madmen '' ( in web tarpley 's phrase ) state their case in clearer and more honest - if that 's the word - prose . i remember reading one article in the national interest which actually made the assertion that we , meaning the usa , will need to engage in terrorism on occassion . i could n't believe they would actually print something like that , but they did . this fundamentally dishonest journal is a waste of time , for the most part , because it is neither interesting ( the statement described in the above paragraph notwithstanding ) nor meant , in the main , really other than to fool the public . kissinger i have a strong suspicion knows what happened on 9/11 and so do i suspect does zakheim ( to put it mildly in the latter 's case ) , and yet they pretend the official version is true . supporting this journal is supporting the bad guys
0	do n't pay amazon $ 34 for this subscription when you can get it directly from national geographic for $ 15
0	why is it that us weekly ca n't get a copy to me weekly ? sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue . then i 'll receive three in one week . us weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses . i 'm not buying their story or the magazine again
0	i was reading this magazine at work , and i consider it to be a trashy magazine . it only focuses on the sexual part of women , like if sex is the best thing in the world , because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi , and she thought the taxi guy was fine , so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts . and then she says it was the *best experience she ever had . i just cant believe they publish garbage like that , giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart , on the emotional , and spiritual side of things . and read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future , and throw away the garbage this society has
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature , stupid , and boring . the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so-called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste . do n't bother
1	i picked up a copy of spirituality health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away . this magazine is wonderful if you 're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life . this magazine covers everything ; mind , body , and spirit , the total package . in the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in . i highly recommend this magazine , as i always catch myself saying to someone , `` i just read this awesome article in spirituality health ...
0	articles were n't anything new . mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads . better info and exercises in oxygen and women 's m
1	though i oftentimes disagree with some of the articles written by the new republic , i can not help but keep coming back to this magazine when trying to gain better insight into current affairs . if for anything else , the quality of the writing in this magazine is amazing and its reporters obviously conduct painstaking research in writing every nuianced article . the group that writes for tnr are obviously some of the best journalistic writers around and its critique on intellecual matters and popular culture are itself enough reason to purchase a subscription to this magazine ( if you do n't like its politics ) . all in all , this is a fine magazine
0	i got charged for this and havent gotten it . what bulls**
0	if you are looking to do major renovation work in rooms of an older house , then this magazine will give you some ideas , before and after pictures , etc . there is precious little about minor jobs , improvements and fixes you may make on an older house . there is a lot of showcasing new and expensive top of the line stuff . my needs are more simple . i want information on fixing and improving things in my house . i am not a professional contractor . for the major stuff , i will hire someone . i have subscribed for three years but find that there is only one or two pages in each issue that can help me . their tv show `` ask this old house '' is much more informative . for magazines , i am going to try `` family handyman '' magazine instead .
1	i love instyle . i can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of instyle . it is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic , timeless fashion . it shows what is hot , how to put outfits together , who wears what , and it does n't try to dabble in other areas . it sticks to fashion and i like that . that is why i subscribe to it and probably always will . the best out there . much better than elle and likely even better than vogue . i love it
0	lucky is one of my frequent checkout pickups . bright , fun , and not requiring any frontal lobe interference , it 's the perfect pick-me-up for the early morning commuter train . i give it five fabulous stars ! however , the actual subscription was very underhanded ! within the space of a week i was sent last month 's issue ( long gone from the stands ) , the issue just about to decirculate , and , finally , the actual current issue . so , two weeks after my order i am already 3 issues in to a 12 issue subscription , and none too happy about it . condï¿½ nast needs to be told that subscribers do not exist to let them clear out their unsold backlog
0	i would agree with previous reviewers , in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read . the number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles . it is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads ( possibly 50 % or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such as viking ranges , bmw 's , oceanna cruises , trips to bora bora ... wtf ? although i do enjoy i a luxury meal , i do n't want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling . ocassionally , behind the clutter , i find a useful recipe ; i rarely find an interesting article . i am going to let my subscription expire at the end of the current period
0	i bought this magazine as reading material for my flight home from ruzyne airport in prague to nyc . this was the first time i ever purchased this magazine . terrible choice . first of all this magazine was not worth the $ 10+ usd i paid for it . it was way too large to do anything with on the airplane and the content was for the lack of a better word boring ! every other page was some chic ad . who buys this magazine ? well i will not be buying it again
1	i can hardly wait for my next copy to come . i look forward to the magazine more than any other magazine i get and read every word in it . i save them for years and go back to them as they have relevance years back when new books come out . they give me pleasure with every read . even though i can read them on the computer i just love having them around the house so i can pick one up and see what was around months ago or years ago . i 'm a real fan . i ca n't say enough . i 've given them as gifts to all of my friends that join audible . i buy books i might not have noticed without reading about it in audiofile . thank you , thank you , thank you . what more can i say . keep them coming .
1	motor trend never fails to deliver . i like the fact that they cover such a wide variety of vehicles , everything from suvs , cuvs , trucks , sportscars , import `` tuners '' , sub-compacts , high-priced exotics , concepts and rumors . the news is fresh and accurate , the issues arrive on time , the mags are thick , pics are crisp , letters are interesting and articles provide usefull information
1	i have been getting this magazine for a year now . i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis . the pictures are pretty . the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed . the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store . there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters . so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them .
0	multi page story on asphalt ? who the f @ # k cares ! ! ! skimpy and unfocused editorially . the only thing they 're consistent about is the use of short punchy blurbs in different fonts and sizes . for example , they had mari holden on the cover of a recent issue promising pro secrets . what was her secret ? my parents told me to use a helmet ... and similar advice from other pros . read cycleplus magazine from the uk for an in depth , systematic approach to product review , ride routes ( almost all in the uk ) and a variety of short relevant articles that inform without dumbing down the issue . ( ok . the two pages on yoga every month is a bit too much but they can get away with that becaause the magazine is so much fatter that bicycling .
1	i 've had a subscription to pc world over the past few years ( as a gift ) and i love it . the articles are very insightful and relevant . i can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue i 'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that i 'm looking to buy
1	i have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine . the interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community , not just a crazy cat person . i like the extensive breeder listing in the back , whether or not i ever will get a pure bred cat .
1	this past summer i picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before i finally got around to reading them . i was impressed . the quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine i 've seen . the image quality , the paper , all top notch . this is a fine arts magazine and does n't ( at least from what i saw ) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art . rather , it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work . there are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine i 've read . i intend on subscribing .
0	i 've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time , but they 've finally hit bottom . the bulk of the april 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars . yes , todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized , but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops . pc mag has been drifting far afield , doing articles on apple computers , gaming systems , and extensive reviews on cameras . instead of pcs , the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it , or is in some way remotely related to computers . the obvious inference is that there 's nothing interesting going on in the pc world , so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages . i find that hard to believe ; i think it 's more likely that the staff has lost their focus , or they 've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about pcs . the lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent . what used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of time magazine . they now have a `` new look '' , and it 's awful . their readership used to consist of well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people do n't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , with cutesy `` handwritten '' notes belaboring the obvious . that 's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans . compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago , and it 's obvious that they 've `` dumbed down '' the entire magazine . i 've subscribed to pc magazine for years , and considered it a `` must read '' to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the pc world . but no more -- it 's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of personal computers .
0	i ordered the journal about a year ago and received 2 issues , and never received another issue . i contacted customer service about the problem , used the problem report forms ( or whatever it 's called ) and never heard from them again . i get this email today telling me to renew my subscription ... ( after i had almost forgotten about the whole incident ) what nerve ! ! ! i remember when i bought this a year ago , another person had written a review warning people that she had not received her subscription . back then i just thought this would never happen to me.. ( the same thing happened with vogue magazine ) boy was i wrong . the 2 issues that i did receive were pretty good though . i buy tons of stuff from amazon but i would highly recommend getting this from another vendor or ebay ( they 're usally cheaper too )
1	having been a bw subscriber for more than two years , i found bw is one of the best business magazines in the us . it is funny to see some readers accused bw to be biased . granted , bw criticized many policies of current administration , because they were against long-term growth of the economy . some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff , those policies will do no one 's good . business is business , for those party-faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes , they do n't need to read anything intelligent and balanced , fox news will be suffecient
0	2 months after ordering , i have year to get my first issue . i 'm sure i 'll like it ... if i ever get it
1	i 've been a subscriber to revolver for over three years now and i must say that they are the best `` bang for your buck '' music mag there is , period ! they pretty much cover all the bases of heavy music ( extreme , doom , death , grind , metalcore , hardcore even punk at times ) . i 'd love to check out other metal mags , well the good ones anyways ( bw , anvil , terrorizer ) , sorry but hit parader and metal edge are kinda lame , too little too late , but also , i simply do n't have the cash for a $ 100+ subscription , all though you do get free sampler cd 's with great bands w/ each mag , revolver bust 's you out w/ free mp3 's each issue too , so you do get to hear something , even though personally i think they could be a little more cutting edge w/ their mp3 choices as they tend to stay in safe territory as far as what they push , whereas terrorizer and bw really give you `` extreme '' music to listen to , as well as their reviews ( they have gotten a bit better ) . i am however a little pissed , as well as confused as to why i just renewed my 3 year subscription for $ 15 and it 's only $ 10 even hear on amazon ... promo ? i guess . oh well , simply put , this is the mag to get if you enjoy metal music magazines .
0	i have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational . recently i have subscribed to shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer . its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks ! ! ! !
1	unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me . however it took quite some time before i could read anything about the era . now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream i wonder if i should have kept up with this magazine . i now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area i was in . the major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information . yet i have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them . there is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in vietnam in that time in history . as with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history . be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items . 1/10 th cavalry 1967-68 armed recon .
0	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to `` take a ride '' on the creativity of others . my advice : do not purchase , read , or advertise in this third-rate publication . there is little more credibility or validity than watching `` jerry springer '' . please , do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only
1	the address label is wrong for proper delivery . has street address instead of post office box
0	i subscribed to hobby farm and after reading two issues i cancelled it . i read an article in the march/april issue about show birds . then , i got my may/june issue . don schrider , the communication director of albc , wrote in to correct the story . the article claimed `` over 1000 '' birds at the show , the correction was 11,640 birds were present . the other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs . in the mar/apr issue i read an article about guinea hens . in the may/june issue i read another letter from a reader ( dana manchester a member of the guinea fowl breeders assoc . ) correcting the article in the previous issue . apparently , guineas are n't the `` watch fowl '' they are portrayed to be , but fall victim to predation often . dana manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of guineas . these may be small errors but how goods is a resource that is n't reliable ? if errors were the only issues , i may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the may/june issue was lacking on many levels . the advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field , fill'er up and drive . one word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden , but there was n't one word on how to rot manure . i liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle , `` bigger is not better '' may/june but we 'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections . i am not waiting around . there are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms . i like mother nature news and i just subscribed to countryside ( my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm , as well ) . i also like john seymour 's book self-sufficient life and how to live it . he has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit .
0	`` spin '' is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype , for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines , then spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he 's cool by name-dropping the strokes . spin covers some of the same turf as rolling stone and blender , but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands . some of them are quite good -- the hives , for example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job on `` blues clues '' after hearing a flaming lips album , and reinvented his life as a rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment , and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever `` coolest '' / '' best '' lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock . indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the comas and metric , but this info is halfhearted . it 's like they 're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands , regardless of talent . the writing , however , has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have : the need to be cool . their writers always are trying to be funny , but rarely come across that way . it seems silly and strained , like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress . even the cd reviews are mediocre . however , one recent highlight is dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , and a little bit skewed . in fact , they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine . one of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in hollywood . scarlett johanssen is a wonderful actress , yes . but she does n't sing , nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . and what is up with party coverage on tv starlet mischa barton and mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under the radar and the online kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands . as for spin ? it 's still trying to convince us it 's cool , but eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it

0	have n't received this item . it has been almost 2 months
0	i loved this magazine in 1995 , until a few years ago . they have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads . no new information . glossy pics of models with bright red lips . what is about health here ? get life extension magazine and alternative medicine magazine . they 've changed too over the last few years , but still a far sight better than this one
1	i never subscribe to anything ! this magazine is great . there are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes . i 'm on a health kick right now and find most cooking magazines are n't that useful to me . i might enjoy reading them but i do n't actually use their recipes . i 've made 4 of the recipes out of this last everyday food issue and they were very healthy ( lots of veggies , chicken , brown rice , salmon etc . ) tasted really good , and were also fast which is a bonus for me . i 'd give this magazine 10 stars if i could : -
1	i always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom -- while she shopped , i hung out in the magazine section reading mad , cracked , and fangoria . now , 25 years later -- i finally got my own subscription -- and unlike retro video games , nostalgic 80 's cd 's , and members only jackets , this is just as good as i remember . it gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases , the low down on independent , if not underground , extreme horror dvd 's , and , as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects . any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine . it is a great read and a lot of fun .
0	but over the last 10 years it has just become another `` muscle '' mag that uses t to prop up its `` bodybuilders '' . i 'm surprised its still around
0	i wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it . will not renew , not what i wanted
1	i watch cnn , too . when there is a big story , i get parts of it on cnn , then newsweek comes and it fills in with a larger story , the bigger picture in a way that i understand . then i relate to other news sources as a more informed listener/reader . if it in fact has a liberal bias , i have not detected it , but i tend to have a slightly liberal bias myself , so i ca n't speak to that . i buy time on the newstand when there is something that seems to be particularly well covered in time . i do not consider newsweek lesser . i used to take time years ago . now i prefer newsweek . the only complaint i might have is that both magazines seem to be having more `` magazine '' , or feature type stories , that i do not see as `` news '' and am not interested in . i think that is driven by these magazines ( both time and newsweek do it ) attempt to find out what works in this expanding world of media . ninety percent of those human interest subjects are not my interest and that annoys me . but the few that speak to me , yes , i will buy a magazine for that . for instance if time has a good article on the older groups of people in america , i will buy that single issue . at the same time i am usually disappointed in whatever is featured in either magazine if it is not news driven . newsweek has been my news magazine that comes in the mail for years . for me , it remains my choice . mary p jones
1	too many christians are ignorant of our rich past . we know a lot about the 1st century and the current times , but everything in between is somewhat blank . christian history magazine is more than informative ; it inspires , challenges and even admonishes in its unique way . i look forward to each issue . i doubt i will ever let this expire
0	if i could give this no stars i would . i bought this magazine because nickelodeon programs are my sons favorite to watch . i bet they were banking on that when they made this sorry exuse of a children 's magazine . not even half of the magazine is ad free ! ! ! ! i bought this to keep my son busy on a flight , and he looked at it maybe two minutes . i wondered why , since he loves everything else nick , so i looked inside for myself . boy was i dissapointed . instead of the quality children 's material i had hoped for , it was just ad after ad . i 'm glad i only bought one issue in the airport , instead of being one of the unfortunate people to purchase an entire subscription before seeing it 's lack of content . if you want a great children 's magazine , go for ladybug for younger children and cricket for older children . they are both high quality and they are n't stuffed full of advertisements like nick
0	i got this magazine as a gift , starting a few months back . i really ca n't say i 'm impressed . admittedly , i 'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything , they 're just fairly rare . if you want to read a well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this is n't it
1	this is an excellent magazine about american history . the magazine provides a wide range of stories on a bi-monthly basis . it does n't repeat the same stories that most people know but it tries to tell instances that are not as well-known . in some cases it is little known stories about significant events and other times they have stories about little known pieces of american history . i only wish the magazine had a monthly publication
1	i like this one better than cosmo . great info on beauty and the like
1	the magazine is made exclusively for hardcore bodybuilders . if you 're into fitness , this magazine ai n't for you . however , if you 're into bodybuilding - hardcore , then this is the magazine for you . it is jam-packed with muscle upon muscle of some of the most hardcore bodybuilders in the business .
1	a magazine filled with hot women , movie reviews , game reviews , and nonsense that is sure to make you laugh out loud because of its stupidity .
0	admittedly , i am slightly older than the `` relevant '' demographic . but i 'm not 40 yet ! so there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me . and i applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues . still , the magazine suffers from it 's unrelenting fawning over the whole post-modern vibe and it 's own sense of self-importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness . ( `` hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks have ipods too ! '' ) usually , the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance , the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant . so , like it 's spiritual cousin `` charisma , '' this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture . it trumpets its ability to ask `` the tough questions , '' even as it follows a relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea of being cutting edge was to put bono on the cover . if you want to be cutting edge , put the libertine adam clayton on the cover and ask him about bono 's faith . now , i would read that article ! ( i am a major u2 and bono fan . i 'm not knocking him ; just the lack of imagination at `` relevant '' . ) there 's also way too much emulation of the world 's perspective on generational heritage . `` hey , we 're young , and we 're smart , and we do n't need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it . '' i guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles does n't cut it in today 's paris hilton culture , but i 'd like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values . actually , `` relevant '' seems to be a little afraid to say what `` biblical values '' are ( beyond the obvious politically expedient ones ) ; it all seems amorphous here . i 've never been a fan of the whole `` what 's hot/what 's not '' ethos . and , i 'd like to give a little more respect to today 's christian young people to think they could handle something that did n't fall into that same faddish trap . i am hopeful that they may get it right yet with `` relevant '' . at times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than a slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization of youth , culture icon quotations , and psycobabble `` cool dude '' theological lingo to make one relevant
0	i cook almost everything from scratch , so i figured home cooking would be for people like me , who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines . instead , recipes consist of packaged dough in a can , bottled sauces , etc . i do n't need to read a magazine to figure out that i can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole !
0	my sixth grader likes it . it is extremely ordinary and easy to outgrow
0	simply stated , if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority , buy the mag . i 'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons
0	i got my first month ( a horrible green day issue ) and then nothing ! uh , what up ? its not that good of a magazine , i just want what i paid for
0	i received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing . boy , am i glad i did n't subscribe ! the magazine is nothing but fluff - good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures - not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health .
0	while i rarely subscribe to magazines , i was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so i signed up for a one year subscription to shape . before and during college i was a ballet dancer , but after entering the real , 9-5 working world half a year ago , exercise time became more difficult to find . unfortunately , i found that shape magazine was not really about exercise at all . it was about beauty products , fancy new-age spas and resorts , and trendy workout accessories . i was also shocked by the models on the magazine 's covers and pages . not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing . i finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through , lacy top on the front of it , visible nipples and all . workout wear ? i think not ! trust me , the woman belonged in a porn magazine , not my exercise magazine
1	touchstone is one of the better magazines/journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past . the editors , numerous in number , are orthodox , roman , and protestant christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the church . in other words , they realize that tradition is the glue that holds the church together , and by extension , sanitizes and sanctifies culture . first things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well . enjoy !
1	this magazine is my dream magazine . i subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store . it has quite a few useful articles covering everything from animal health to hoof trimming , to special breed information and generators . i think it 's a must for anyone who has ever been interested in farming or ranching , or just getting back to the country life
1	this magazine has beautiful pictures , heartwarming stories and as a bonus , a laugh or two . it covers the countryside of all of the united states and reminds you of a slower , more genteel time . it makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself . if you long for life outside of the city , you 'll enjoy this obvious labor of love
1	a good start to create your own business
1	saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from food festivals to very easy-to-make recipes , like blueberry pudding . while there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy , the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare . restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials . while reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like chicken fried steak . yes , this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for olive bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills . after reading this magazine i 'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything i 'm putting in the oven . the recipe for stuffed tomatoes and summer squash had me wishing it was october again and the recipe for fig jam reminded me of my childhood in africa where we had a fig tree in the backyard . saveur is filled with nostalgia , entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes . with amazon 's gourmet food section , we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine . ~the rebecca review
0	i still have not received this magazine , what is taking so long ! !
0	lots of lovely photos , great ideas , deco tips and food
1	a friend introduced me to this fun magazine . without being ponderous , it has more useful and accessible information than i 've seen in one food or wine journal in a long time . i 've learned practical things like not to buy the econony sized vermouth , 'cause it wo n't keep well once opened , or the best sparkling ciders , what wine to bring as a dinner party gift , and why guinness tastes better in ireland . it has great virtual trips - like to thailand , oaxaco , and jamaica woven around the theme of the liquid pleasures produced in each country - everything from tea to rum , or chocolate . i find it humanizes the products from all over the world that i take for granted - while giving me imaginative ways to serve them . when cnn starts to drown me with bad news , this snappy mag is as refreshing as thai iced tea or a tall vermouth cassis
0	the magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up ... it is not . an 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes , being sexually active and kissing . i am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate
0	it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head . it skims the surface and is 'pop ' . anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world . again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world ( newsweek is exactly the same ) especially in the united states . time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice . the other irritating thing about time is it 's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious . subscribe to the economist , there are less pictures !
1	indispensable guide to what is happening in movies , television , books , and popular culture . comprehensive , witty , well-written and , of course , entertaining
0	first off , i 'm a huge geek . i love programming and computers and the internet . you 'd think wired would be like some great magazine for me . but the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this `` bad '' stuff in the world , it makes you sick . for every cool article about japanese robots , you have to wade through like 10 articles about `` how america is doomed '' . whatever ... they need to man up
1	consistently the best sports writing in a periodical format -- i even find myself absorbed in articles in sports i know little about or have n't followed because the writing is so good . photography is great , too
1	i got american girl when i was nine . and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it . i think you can be intreseted in teen people type magazines but still love american girl . it has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the `` lunch box '' section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school . it is a short magazine , but they make up for it by having the jumbo summer issue . i think its definitaly worth the money .
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
0	i ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue , but unfortunately over the course of the year i only received a total of three issues ! the magazine is great , but i wonder what the problem is . i have no received much help from amazon or modern bride . guess i learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore .
1	if you have any interest in design , i recommend getting this mag , it has the latest trends in design as well as new products and designers
0	the latest pshycology today had to be trashed . the clinic treats abused women and incest and rape victims ... .lust did n't go over well
0	i ordered this magazine a year ago , and my nephew still have n't receive a single magazine ! every time i email customer service they would tell me that it 's coming next month . i will let you how the magazine is when i get it , but do n't hold your breath .
1	just received my first issue and it is just wonderful . great ideas and recipes which everyone can enjoy . looking forward to more issues
0	i can not review something that i have not received . i thought i would have received my first issue by now but have not . if and when i receive the magazien i order i will be happy to review
0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage , and recent years have only accelerated this trend . in the 60s and 70s , it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend ( originally it was considered quite conservative ) , but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance . as for its being part of the `` liberal '' media , this is inaccurate . recent coverage of the ( 2004 ) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person . the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered , except for one very brief article listing a few `` fact check '' points . instead , the cover story wa about new products and movies , a kind of sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan . it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election , but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office . in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment . the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush , but it 's still mostly bland and superficial . your money is better spent on the british magazine `` the economist '' which is far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint is conservative , it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics . `` the economist '' also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach to the news . time can still be entertaining to read , but i would n't take what they say too seriously . they tend to bend with the political wind
1	the young rider is the best horse magazine for kids . it encourages horse lovers to love horses even more . it has great tips on riding english and western saddle . it publishes letters that readers sent in the magazine . young rider also advertizes horse camps , tack , and riding clubs . every magazine has two huge posters . my room is full of them . it talks about horse problems and how to cure them , horse breeds , stories , quizez , comics , and lots lots lots more ! it is good for kids 5-15 and is great even if you are not a horse lover . all my freinds love this magazine ! i loke this magazine ! why ca n't you ! ! ! you will not be disipointed . so what are you waiting for ? subscribe now ! ! !
1	most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere . having lived in washington , i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado , but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all ca n't live in the pacific northwest . i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice , but i do wish bh would take that into consideration . otherwise , i love this magazine . i used to get several magazines , but this was always my favorite . it is chock full of ideas that we can really use . and i love the photography . what sets bh apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses . slippers on the floor , newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too . they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot . it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable . i would say get this magazine right away . i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing .
1	very simple , i do not give perfect ratings for anyone or anything
0	as a member of a southern family who treasured this magazine , it is with a heavy heart and a sense of loss that i have decided not to renew my subscription this year . yes , i 've always given the brides in our family a subscription as a gift , and waited eagerly for my issue to come in the mail . but those days are past . southern living magazine has been offered to all states for some time now , and i believe this has caused the editors to try to appeal to a broader readership . this , in turn , has changed the recipe section into something one can find in any other magazine . honestly , i do love all sorts of different cuisines , but in a magazine called `` southern living '' , i expect to find wonderful and traditional southern recipes ! this magazine needs to go back to it 's roots . from now on , i 'll be giving new brides a subscription to southern lady magazine , and that 's what i 'll be reading myself ! i will miss the christmas book , though .
0	i thought i detected some deterioration in the quality of discover magazine in recent months , so i went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion . indeed they have . sad .
0	this is great if you 're a hobbyist . or a maker of hotel..no motel paintings . sucks if you 're not
0	first off , i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years , and enjoyed it . but the `` main guy '' robert kennedy , is someone who offends me both personally and politically . he assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny . for his information , some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well , and are still heavy-set . his comments on heavy-set people are offensive , thoughtless , and sometimes even downright cruel . nonetheless , the pictures/articles were inspiring to me , and it is a decent fitness magazine
1	the `` new yorker '' for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends . the articles are well written , though occasionally idiosyncratic . it is one of two magazines i subscribe to ( the other being the new yorker . ) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards , then this magazine will appeal to you . it is not gourmet or martha stewart ( not that i have a problem with either of those titles , this magazine is just different ) , but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice
0	i have read and subscribed to organic gardening ( and farming ) since mid-70 's but dropped my subscription in and around 2000 . i pick up an issue now and then in newstands , just to `` check in '' and hope for a return to the `` good ole days '' . the publication used to be superior ( find old issues in a library to see the what i mean - especially the 70 's ) and gave tons of information to all levels of gardeners ( some issues used to have 100 's of pages , almost all text - though in a smaller format ) . i still have old copies and to this day find inspiration in those articles . now its just large glossy pictures , sparse writing , reduced page counts , basic gardening info/lists and more than a dose of maria rodale 's opinion/politics . i guess their surveys/advertisers tell them this is what `` organic '' gardeners want ... but i would bet robert rodale ( who edited the mag back in 70 's and early 80 's ) would be upset to see how his daughter has screwed up the magazine . save your subscription and read the old ones at a library . yeah ... the varieties will be out of date ( that 's what a seed catalog is good for and/or seedsavers.org ) but the info is pure `` organic gardening ''
0	wired magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine : that there is a level of cynical , style-whoring , inaccurate , myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely `` trading substance for style . '' wired is consistently behind the curve these days , but that does n't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know . in articles about controversial subjects , one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that i find them offensive even when i disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall . just as often , features which do n't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them , making fun of a person , group , or idea in a way that is n't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted by the subject matter . generally , wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and it industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst , desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths , shoddy reasoning , and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . is n't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin , double-talk , and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent , absurd bravado of battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize for technology 's promise and educate about its current and future potential . instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for `` hip '' that forwards an attitude rather than a message , with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy , having more in common with advertising than edification
1	this magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy . years ago , i subscribed to the magazine and now , as an international relations grad student , i use articles in the national interest to address my areas of concentration . the pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth . i appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue . i particularly like the reporter-at-large feature and the recent `` conversation with henry kissinger '' segment . top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers , well-known policy-makers , and prestigious journalists make the national interest an exciting read . the broad and varied views enhance my studies . i like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others i read like the economist , foreign affairs and foreign policy . i find that every article offers level-headed reasoning ; no sound bites , no bumper-sticker clichï¿½s . the articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions . for anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy , and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the `` front lines '' of world affairs , this is the magazine i recommend without reservation . 2nd year graduate student at the yale university , mcmillan center of international studies .
1	i have been a faithful subscriber for approximately 10 years . this is the magazine that impatiently wait for every month . it has beauty tips , interesting articles , fitness information , etc . i even gave my mother a gift subscription . it 's the best
0	loved the magazine , but after two years of it , the onslaught of mostly bare-chested men both in the mag and on the cover was too much . where are the women ? if it is targeting the gay audience , please say so . each month , i 'd count the number of men vs. women photos and there are very few women . just unshaven boys . not my cup of tea , so my subscription has n't been renewed
0	what can be said ? the show sucks and the magazine is just an ad for it ! wow , that 's impressive . just makes you wonder how much money the `` this old house '' folks are swimming in , does n't it . yep ! look at all the 1-star reviews . does n't that signal you not to buy it ? does n't it ? local crazy monke
0	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover . unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising . as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual `` content '' in about an hour . the rest is advertising and bs . this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago . just let it die already like it 's supposed to
1	no ads . large print . beautiful illustrations . interesting age appropriate stories . every magazine by this publisher ( cricket , etc ) are all quality magazines that are child centered . my daughter is five . i think this is a bit young for her but she loves it and 'reads ' it cover to cover . she also enjoys looking at the pictures as well . this is worth every penny .
1	i am so happy that there is a market for this magazine . the mantra of the book is dead people is thwarted by this pub . i scribble down scores of books each issue that i have to read and it reawakens my interest in books that i missed when they feature classics . i buy more books than ever now thanks ( or maybe no thanks ) to this magazine
1	i 'm usually not one for taking a chance on new magazines ( especially if they 've been shoved down the public 's throats or oprah winfrey endorses it ) but this is one instance where oprah gets major-league credit for putting her faith and money in rachael ray . i was impressed with the magazine 's layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - and the recipes contained within are delicious and easy to prepare ( and you wo n't go searching every speciality shop in the country for the ingredients , either ) . i also like how rachael let readers in on her italian wedding and african safari honeymoon . unlike other celebrities , she did n't let us know too much information ( thank you ! ) and i 'm sure her recommendations of trattorias , cafes , and hotels in tuscany are worth the time and easy on the budget . just because she does n't have initials besides her name and a culinary degree ( she 's not the only one on the food network lacking this ! ) , rachael spent her whole life in restaurants and with food and she learned the same tricks of the trade that the fusion chefs on the network know . this is definitely worth a look at and i 'm seriously considering ordering a subscription .
1	still talking about the 'asian thing ' ? - get a grip ! ! this is the best magazine on the market . period . it speaks to you in an honest matter and the info is top rated . there just is no better men 's magazine without a nude centerfold .
0	i was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas . it is n't really , and there is n't really that much to this magazine . it is just another tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked at the august and september issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on elton john 's out of africa fundraiser and the article on julian mcmahon . the rest of it was ads , and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in vogue magazine , but the same old ads you 'll see anywhere else , and they are annoying . there were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it `` plastic person syndrome '' ) mark consuelos , waay too much on jennifer garner and her baby , and other weird things , such as the trend of designer cupcakes . i wish i was kidding on the latter , but i am not , nor do i have $ 25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is jessica alba 's favorite . there was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here . despite the size of this magazine , there is very little to sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos of the same old same old , and tips for mimicking them . i am not interested in becoming a teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested in seeing vanessa carlton 's pad . this magazine is for you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , a subscription that is actually not a year ( it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine ) and your life 's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in new york because some celebrity did . this magazine is mediocre at best , and the worst part is , it has the exact same fashion advice as vogue . i went with vogue because there is substance in their magazine , and the ads are classy and very chic . leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at aol time warner .
1	keeps you up to date on the worlds sports news of the week . is better than t
0	i was reading this magazine at work , and i consider it to be a trashy magazine . it only focuses on the sexual part of women , like if sex is the best thing in the world , because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi , and she thought the taxi guy was fine , so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts . and then she says it was the *best experience she ever had . i just cant believe they publish garbage like that , giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart , on the emotional , and spiritual side of things . and read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future , and throw away the garbage this society has
1	i 'm a bit of a magazine junkie and subscribe to about 15 different magazines ( and slowly reviewing them all ) . in style is definitely my favorite fashion magazine . it does n't give advice on how to pleasure your man but they do have a few fun articles on celebrities and fashion-related news . the styles they show are so versatile and easy to assemble yourself in real life . in style offers alternatives to super expensive clothing by categoring some pieces in $ , $ $ , and $ $ $ . i love it because i can afford 80 % of the fashion they show , whereas elle , vogue , and w are all a little bit `` over '' my taste . to me , in style is more affordable and easier to relate to on an everyday basis . if you do enjoy high fashion and $ 1000 purses , you should probably look elsewhere . in style offers a healthy dose of celebrity fashion that i need every month , and i really , do do do love this magazine
1	as your grandfather told you , you ca n't always judge a book by its cover . nor , these days , does the title of a magazine always clue you into the content that begins on page three . refreshing , then , to page through an issue of car and driver and find that -- still crazy after all these years -- it 's *still* about cars and drivers . do n't get me wrong ; the usual suspects do appear month after month in columns that dig into one aspect or another of the auto industry . and there are those ubiquitous pages of ads from the major auto producers and the after-market confectioners of shiny things to bolt onto them . but everything else is about cars and the people who drive them . to be slightly more accurate : about cars , written by and for the people who drive them . a fair number of pages are given over to the exotic and performo varieties of the four-wheeled and the fast . but car and driver displays no embarrassment about majoring on the cars that the rest of us drive . or might drive or might choose never to drive , given due attention to the reviews put into the hands of drivers like this reviewer by drivers who drive for a living . ' wan na ' know what madonna drives ? buy another magazine . ' wan na ' know what 's new in the '07 chevies , fords , and bimmers ? that would be car and driver
0	where are the critiques ? the articles lack any critical substance . whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed . it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype , vibe will go along with the flow . on top of that , there are more ads now than ever before . even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space .
1	growing up in the church , i 've received a lot of christian magazines , from in depth analysis on scripture , to q on highschool drama help , but all have fallen short of what young christians today are looking for . i followed relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine and kept up with the amazing articles online . i was very excited for the debut of a magazine that made god relevant to specific everyday life decisions and made god seem ever more practical in the way we construct our lifestyles . god has obviously done great things with this staff and is still working . their podcast is also great and really demonstrates the character of today 's young christian thinkers who are excited in their faith and are willing to show it . they bring a lot to hope and pray for for the christians living in a culture that denies christ . i 'm not a twentysomething quite yet , but the message of relevant is important which is : put away with your indifference and go out and make a mark on culture for the glory of god
0	give me a break , people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip-off/wanna-be of alternative press.i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years.think i may 've saved one of those issues.sometimes , i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind.i 'll then take it home , then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice.avoid at all costs
1	the best weekly news magazine on the market , time also gives science and technology updates , movie reviews , some celeb news , and provocative articles on world trends . well worth a subscription , especially if you do n't have time for the nightly new
0	this magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work , had time to work out four hours a day , had your own chef , could go on vacation six months out of the year , or could afford ( or cared ) about fashion . otherwise do n't bother . they sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it
0	i started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81 . it was excellent ! ! it had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to `` preventing '' ailments/conditions . now it 's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters ! wow ... what a change now . i 'm not interested in `` paying '' to read ads . i 'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources . besides , i got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while i rode the stationery bike ! what a waste of trees . :
1	my impression of mainstream american food magazine is that they focus on mostly hearty meals and thick , dense , and rich desserts , which is not what ij 'd like to include in my diet . delicious magazine is different , it has a lot of refreshing and light dishes . it is more expensive then the other magazines probably because it 's being imported and printed in australia ( instead of printed in china like other books nowadays ) . you should try to see if your local bookseller carries it because the cover price is only us $ 8.99 per issue/month . when i am writing this review , amazon is selling it for us $ 126 for 11 issues . you do the math ;
1	a great magazine that puts the rest of `` womens magazines '' to shame . this one talks about women 's issues worldwide , what you can do to help , as well as the more mainstream fashion stuff . also not heavy on the advertising like so many . a great magazine
1	i 'm a beginner and this magazine came highly recommended by experts at the yarn store . at first i was amazed at the amount of advertizing . i enjoy the variety of patterns offered . it still may be a little too advanced for my stage of knitting when reading pattern instructions . overall , i look forward to future issues
0	if i see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek i am going to puke ... i have not seen one truly imaginative , artistic image in this magazine . everything is run of the mill , boring , standard outdoor photography . lots of sunsets , flower fields . no different angles or perspectives , colors , nothing new . the articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive . i think i clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines..
0	i paid too much from amazon . the subscription would be significantly less expensive straight from the magazine . i learned my lesson
0	do not order . they only placed an order for 7 months but i got billed for 12 . after 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it . after pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but can not extend the subscription . only order from the magazine itself
1	i have been subscribing to `` young rider '' for 4 years now . my grand daughter has loved this magazine from the begining . she saves all the pictures posters . she even takes the magazine to horse shows to be autographed by `` stars '' she reads about . our family has standardbreds , so she has always been around horses and she has developed a love and understanding and a talent in the show ring . this magazine has contributed to her growth
1	the new york review of books is published 20 times a year , biweekly except in january , july , august and september . it is a respected publication which is devoted mostly to reviews of current books and an occasional movie . it also contains articles of social or political interest . the letters section is usually brief with little waste . contributors to a recent edition included mark danner , sister helen prejean and daniel mendelsohn . reviews covered such diverse items as a collection of short stories by graham greene and two books about the actress anna may wong in addition to alexander , a film directed by oliver stone . the new york review of books consistently offers provocative writing in a highly readable style . it definitely deserves its reputation for excellence
0	this magazine reads like an inflight magazine : something airlines , careful to not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out to lull their readers to sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . do n't you wish someone out there would publish a really good magazine about books ? one that featured meaty stories and well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ai n't it . it is dull and bland . occasionally it offers up a conservative book review by neocon writer catherine seipp , who is about as enlightening as bill o'reilly ( that is , entertaining and offensive and laughably stupid ) so this can sometimes cut the dull . but someone here said bland and i agree . avoid this one if you have an iq above 90 . pick up the new yorker , the atlantic monthly or harper 's if you like to read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries and other badly written pieces of fluff -- which is all this magazine covers -- this might just be the thing for you . i want my money back
0	this magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away . i was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside , but the articles are very short and pointless . it was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they do n't know what their doing
1	men 's health magazine provides informationand tips on men 's fitness , health , sex , career , relationships , nutrition , recipes , weight loss and muscle building.no matter how much you know about men 's health , there 's always room to know more about ways to a better lifestyle , the top men 's health concerns , and the importance of getting medical care and regular screening tests.so you deserve to pay more attention to yourself ! take better care of yourself physically , mentally , and emotionally . or if you are a woman searching for ways to help the men in your life , tell them about the men 's health . one way to start is to use the resources you 'll find in the magazine here.this magazine is dealing with all aspects of the daily lives .
1	spike fett is mistaken . the 100 greatest moments he mentions is not for all time . they were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime , which is only 8 years . this is one of the best film/dvd magazines out there . i highly reccomend it . it has awesome articles , reliable reviews , and great color photos . another thing i like about it is that its an british publication , so you get a different opinion and point of view . its a great magazine .
1	i have been a regular subscriber of sci fi mags for just about the past 15 yrs or so . it all began with omni and when omni folded , i found a a copy of science fiction age . i had been subscribed to it for about 2 years before it folded . i found a few omni-like glossy mag twins thereafter , but they all folded as well . finally , i found the magazine of fantasy and science fiction and analog and have been consistently subscribed to other for the past 10 yrs . both of the latter are outstanding 'zines but for me , analog is the best because it satisfies the craving for hard sci fi and *fact* at the same time . if f analog ever have to close up shop then i would hope they would merge because then i 'd have my hard sci fi , fact *and* horror/fantasy all in a one stop shop .
1	in this age of digital media , a billion cable channels and the internet , you might think nat geo print editions are a dinosaur . but far from it . a fan of the flagship mag , adventure was a pleasant surprise . the magazine is full of compelling , exotic and education stories with great journalism , writing and photos . bravo nat geo
0	its been months and i still have not recieved my copy of this magazine . they had no problem charging my credit card , but they cant seem to get a copy of this weekly magazine out in under a quater of a year . what a bunch of nonesense .
0	it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head . it skims the surface and is 'pop ' . anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world . again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world ( newsweek is exactly the same ) especially in the united states . time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice . the other irritating thing about time is it 's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious . subscribe to the economist , there are less pictures !
0	i have been a reader of businessweek for over 10 years . i have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year . while there are more articles on `` personal business '' , the hard-core articles have gone the way of newsweek , and u.s. news and world reports . the nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today . like many others , i have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year . specifically , their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left . bob kuttner is co-editor of the american prospect and contributor to the boston globe . every one of his articles begins with the premise that the president 's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis , to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson is better , but as a former clinton advisor , is not objective in her analysis . alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout , does not agree with the numbers stated in their own figures of the week . while bw has the potential for great reporting based on their resources , they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting . for serious business readers and students , i recommend going to alternative sources . and yes , i will let my subscription lapse this year .
1	unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents/teachers , this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do , that do n't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials , and that are very attractive when finished . i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it -- very important when it comes to encouraging creativity .
0	this is a disgusting rag full of synthol articles , profanity , porn , and blurry black-and-white photos . it has nothing positive to say about bodybuilding , and it 's obvious publisher steve blechman only wants to destroy competitive bodybuilding at any cost
0	the latest pshycology today had to be trashed . the clinic treats abused women and incest and rape victims ... .lust did n't go over well
1	i do n't speak a word of french , and i barely read it , but i love this magazine ! ! ! if you love fashion , get a french dictionary , i did , this is a magazine to savor ! i have every issue since ms. roitfeld took over and will keep them forever ! this magazine is very sexy , modern , french , well edited , up to the minute , bold , well designed ( fabian baron ) intelligent , i could go on and on , i 've seen/get all the rest , including vogue italia , this edition has all the best stylists , photogs , and editors , i ca n't wait for the next issue !
0	all this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes . i ca n't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number anywhere to contact customer service . do n't waste your money unless you love paris hilton
0	order placed early june . first issue of subscription not yet received . this is service
0	as a new elementary art teacher , i do not find school arts to be a very helpful magazine at all . other educators write in general ideas about lessons to teach , but do not specifically outline materials , vocabulary , procedures , safety cautions , steps , or ways to integrate art lessons with general subject areas . i was also hoping for large posters to use with lessons . the posters and art lessons in instructor magazine are much more hands on and usefull . also , because the magazine has lessons for all ages and grades , there are only a couple of lessons to work with on the elementary level . i will not renew my subscription on this magazine . new copies i receive lay around unopened and useless
1	new moon is an okay magazine , but some of the articals might bore you like about `` duck tape fan . '' or something like that , it is sort of like a school magazine that teachers might want you to only read in their class , but some of the stuff is good , i am a magazine freak and i have all the discovery girls issues and it is nothing like new moon , new moon has facts about not be mean but `` dead people . '' and that is just really boring . i suggest this magazine to a history fan or a science fan , because it is for you.. discovery girls atleast has celebrity interviews and makeup and things about crushes , and reader art and cool stuff , but this magazine has things like : 1- a topic about stuff that is annoying and one girl was saying that she was not ''gay . '' but always was holding her friends hand.. :0 it is gross ... 2- a fan of duck tape , it shows a picture of girl having tuck tape all over her.. creepy.. 3- wierd musems.. uh sigh , boring ! i tried out this magazine thinking it was just what i needed , yeah right , it was boring , the only part i liked was the letters and the comics , i suggest getting a subsription to bop or discovery girls , because you wont enjoy this ! plus it 's 5.50 ! i am so mad because i wasted it on this crud . i am 13 and this the second worst magazine i 've read ! the magazine for any girl is discovery girls , and my favorite issue is august/september 2004 because taylor dooley is on it . ** check out my other reviews ! **
0	great magazine but beware of subscriptions . my subscription was paid for back in august '06 and i have yet to see a copy ( january '07 ) . their customer service have assured me twice that they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives . plus , the phone number they provided is not in service ! its a shame because the magazine looks to be really well done
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
0	i ordered this magazine thru amazon three months ago , and still have n't received a single issue . i 've emailed their subscription department to no avail . they have my money , but i do n't have a magazine
1	this is by far the best design magazine anywhere . the price might be daunting but , beyond being on the bleeding edge content-wise , issues are typically loaded with custom papers , finishes , a fold out poster , postcards , and other generally inspiring material . if you are tired of yuppie design rags and are looking for great work that spans an incredible range ( every month ) , this is it . not for `` 8 ways to better drop shadows '' types . this is the real deal
0	the thing i hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section . supposedly , they 're written by real people . but after reading this magazine for the last few years , these letters all seem to have the same maudlin , soporific , sappy style of prose that reads to me like they 've been edited that way . there 's this condescending `` athletes are supposed to behave like good ladies and gentlemen and if they do n't , then tsk tsk - what will the children think ? '' mentality that i absolutely hate . the good things about si are the photography and whatever articles on the nba they have any given week . and the swimsuit issue ? i guess if you 're a 13-14 year old it 's exciting as all get out - i 'll take the hard stuff any day over their annual fleshfest
0	occasionally when i go to the grocery store i pick up a magazine by the check out counter . so i bought an issue of fitness magazine and then decided to get a subscription . i do n't know what the heck i was thinking . each time i got the issue i noticed there was always some skinny blond chick on the cover wearing a bikini . there were never any women of color on the cover . so when i was sent a letter , asking if i 'd like to renew my subscription , i said he11 no . i 'm not wasting my money on a so-called fitness magazine that does n't feature women of color on its cover . there 's just no way . i thought fitness was for everybody , not just for skinny blondes who wear bikinis . and just because your skinny does n't make you `fit ' either . skip this if possible
1	i think j-14 is a really good magazine if u like to hear the latest gossip about all your favourite celebrity 's , or if u like to get nice posters of all the hot celebrity 's , or even if u like to take those quizes to find out lots of neat different things ! ! i recomend this magazine to anyone who likes either of those things
1	the recipes are great and so is the travel advice for those seeking a good meal while traveling . i get great ideas for presentation and entertaining at home . if you enjoy fine dining , or just reading about it , then this magazine is worth a subscription and would make a nice holiday gift that will keep giving year roun
0	i ca n't imagine how many hours of my life i wasted worrying about ego-trippin ' jocks . although , i understand how i got hooked on this bad habit . the rich folk who own our media do a great job of marketing this endless diversion to the masses . so , instead of worrying about economic justice , environmental destruction , the well-being of children and so forth ; the passion of a large segment of the general public is frittered away on watching one city 's gladiators combat another city 's gladiators . on top of that , with the us vs. them pattern of thinking that is encouraged , the anthem singing , and so many pro sports figures involved with right-wing politics ( bernie kosar , john elway , steve largent ) , i 've come to realize how poltically-charged this so called `` escape '' actually is . on top of that , i just got sick of all these sports announcers barking about this or that , wagging their finger in my face . the ads in sports illustrated are also a bunch of macho [ ... ] . by the way , before he was killed by `` friendly fire , '' pat tillman was reading noam chomsky and howard zinn books . in fact , he had arranged to have a meeting with chomsky after he returned from our war of terror . too bad he was n't able to pursue that path . my interest in sports is now limited to badminton in my backyard , and books like `` what 's my name fool ? '' which is about how sports figures sometimes remember issues like peace and justice
0	i have not yet recieved this magazine , how could it be reviewed
1	the london review of books is , without a doubt the best literary journal in the world : at the same time erudite , entertaining and informative , each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media . there was a time in my life when i could n't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter , but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob . highly recommended
1	this is an excellent magazine . there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover . this is one of the few . the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right . they are gorgeous . the writing is clear and concise and interesting . the topics they write on include history , travel , historical objects , animals , places and so on . one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers . each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture important . they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed ( if it is a person ) . this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money . enjoy .
0	this is one of the many magazines that float around the school library , and it is the most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all that is in it is pure celebrity gossip . there is really nothing else in here . if you like blurry photos of lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul and the like , ( blurry so you ca n't see the zits and the flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it was coming back . she was wearing a baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts are common among women wanting to hide a gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far as i can tell ) . if you want to read about the fact that nichole richie has acquired yet another chloe paddington , the fact that donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now that he has gotten her knocked up , or you would like to see photos of victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine is full of lies as well-for instance , one writer claims that young people like lindsay lohan can get higher car insurance rates for accidents they were not at fault in . false ! you only get higher rates if you are at fault . this magazine is nothing more than an overpriced tabloid . there is nothing of value in here . half the time the insider is some anonymous friend , and half the time the facts are n't right . avoid this thing at all costs , unless of course you are a celebrity worshipper . i 've got better things to do than worship people who have too much money for their own good . i 'll stick to more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch
1	i have been a subscriber of shop etc . since its debut , when i heard that they were going to publish a magazine for familes i ran to subscribe and i have not been disapointed yet ! i love it
0	this magazine used to be thick , fun to read , full of information . but that was about 5 years ago . now it 's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense . the editorial is almost always filled with political opinions . i wo n't renew my subscription
0	i 've subscripted to gourmet for years but i let my subscription run out . the lifestyle articles keep pushing out the recipies . as i read through food magazines i dog-ear the page with a recipe i want to try . in the last year there were very few dog-eared pages and it was n't worth continuing the subscription
1	tsn is an excellent sports magazine for the general sports fan . it covers nearly all the sports in and out of season , including nascar autoracing . a sports fan will find something of interest in every issue . i was able to find a free subscription which makes it ever better ! i would recommend it to any sportsfan who wants to read about his favorite teams or sport
0	i have yet to see a pw review of anything that was not vetted by the pc police , not to mention utterly stupid . when they want to pan a book , they apparently have a list of criticisms they pick from at random , such as `` non sequitur '' or `` murky argument '' or `` reductionist '' . they pick them by throwing darts at the list and writing down whatever phrases the darts hit , in ways that prove that they do n't actually have any understanding of what the terms mean . it 's especially annoying because even when it 's a book i like , i can easily see criticisms that someone with a different worldview could make that would be valid , but they do n't make them ; that would require work . the reviews are so shoddy and wildly inaccurate that i thought about asking amazon.com to stop using them for the product info pages , but then it occurred to me that any book pw pans is guaranteed to be good , so they are useful in a backwards way . anytime pw praises a book , i do n't bother with it , but if they attack it , i know it 's going to be great
1	i only got the first issue , but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers ( hence the name ) . i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction . they might do well to keep the two separate , especially the contests and events . it 's an attractive format and very upscale , high quality literature reviews and advice . the stories are well written and enjoyable , although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers
1	this magazine is absolutely wonderful . after receiving my first copy , i went to their website and backordered about 10 copies ... excellent reading and information regarding ideas on what people are doing to successfully make money off of your land ... alpacas , flower growing , chickens , small and larger animal livestock , etc ! lots of neat advertisements too , on things you just didnt know existed ... ..i will never be without this magazine , it is inspirational
0	where macworld is bad , addict is dreadful . it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat , and the `` reviews '' do n't deserve the name . the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing , leaving no pretence of independence . like its competitor , it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry , so we get articles about the `` secrets '' of such and such product . a `` secret '' in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer . this should be blasted , not applauded . but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product
0	have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it . simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme . they say we americans are obese in body , but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism . page after page of glossy ads for things we do not need . and rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections . sure they make pretty pictures , but who wants all that 'junk ' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful . i recommend the magazine dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning . for someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden , oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply . and how many homes does one american need , when so many americans can not afford even one
0	if you 're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on . there is nothing of substance in cosmopolitan . open the latest issue and you will find `` sex tips that will drive your man crazy ! ! ! '' and `` snag that cutie ! ! '' galore . it 's pathetic . and sophomoric . the sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a ) looking for your `` one true love '' and by default b ) how to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners/boyfriends whilst on said search ! and let 's not forget inane question and answer spreads . those are a hoot with such inquires as `` my crack gets really itchy . what should i do ? '' no , this magazine is not my bible . this is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace
0	i ordered on 10/4/2005 . as of march 27th , i still have n't received the first issue , i do n't even want it now ! how do i get credit for the payment made back in october
0	gee , i guess i really ca n't rate it . i ordered it on august 9th , and still have not recieved it as of november 3rd . guess i 'll know better then to order through amazon again
1	this mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality . it 's an icon all over the world . the editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism . she and vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent . without vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry
0	during the 1970s , bicycling was a great magazine with lots of in-depth articles about bike tours , bike racing , and bicycle technology . the magazine zoomed downhill through the 1990s into the worthless rag that it is now . the articles in the current version of the magazine are very superficial and lifeless . many are thinly veiled press releases from various advertisers . if you really want to learn about road bicycles and bicycling , a much better magazineis *cyclingplus* . for mountain biking , try *bike* or *dirt rag*
1	i have subscribed to business week for two years now . i suggest that people accusing them of having a liberal agenda reread their past issues . bush was receiving criticism for not being republican enough ! his deficit spending is the most clear example . other fiscal conservatives , such as george will , have criticized the president . does that mean they are following a liberal agenda ? i think not
1	this magazine is pretty . i am not that interested in long articles , so the fact that this magazine has alot of pictures helped .
0	i used to love light tasty , then they decided to change the look and format , even though reader surveys said keep it the same . the new look is hard to read , and lacks the down-home feel that makes the magazines popular . there are less pictures of the finished dishes , and the pictures they do show are smaller . they added full page ads for thier country store products , which goes against the no ad promise . i have subscribed for years , but this new look is horrible . get it at the store to see if you like it first
1	`` fortune '' is a classic on the newsstand , and is as vital and important today as ever . `` fortune '' generally caters to people with a managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world , the global and national economic climate , and forward-looking technology and trend information . each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story , like the enron trial , or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year . i do enjoy the articles where they rank things , but more than the rankings themselves , i am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings ; while i do n't always agree with the magazine , i do always find it good food for thought . the features are generally very polished and accurate , and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a ceo as to a college business student . i particularly appreciate the interviews that `` fortune '' has with key players in the financial industry , and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue . the magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like `` kiplinger 's . '' nonetheless , the investment advice and insight `` fortune '' offers should generally be held in high esteem . i also appreciate the coverage of key trends , and in particular want to note that `` fortune '' has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in america : coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader . many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money ; while there are several i would recommend , `` fortune '' remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends , and should be a part of everyone 's business library
1	this magazine is great ! for sport-specific magazines , this is probably one of the best that i have seen . yes , the photos are large and detailed . but , the kicker is the writing . incredible content without being wordy . variety of topics and approaches brings out varying highlights of the sport . just very impressive
0	well , imagine my surprise when i picked up the february 2004 issue , and found that things had drastically changed . mainly in the editor 's letter . it used to be 1 page , now it 's just a small little column now , that is exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now the redesign isnt as bad as other zd game mags , but the removal of the 1 page editor 's letter , really steams me up . at least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey 's scorched earth column . it 's still 1 page . it 's on the last page usually . and yes the redesign is really bad in terms of readability . most of the time they have a red or blue or yellow background , and it 's really hard to read the text at times . now at least their disc will auto-load , unlike pc gamer . and what really pisses me off , is when a magazine has a hot 100 section , or a best pc 's or videocards , or peripherals section , and they hardly ever change the captions or descriptions come with it . i 'm sorry if i got off track a lot , but i felt the need to . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor 's and the editor-in-chief was re-assigned to become the editor-in-chief of the official xbox magazine . the new eic of pcg is the former executive editor , and i hate him , so this is why i say cgw is now the best pc games magazine
0	i ordered the magizine subsribtion and when i ordered they told me it would take up to 6 weeks , so i went out and bought that months issue . a few weeks later that issue came , which is understandable but they had sent me the previous month before that . i hadnt even ordered my subsription that month .
0	if i could give this no stars i would . i bought this magazine because nickelodeon programs are my sons favorite to watch . i bet they were banking on that when they made this sorry exuse of a children 's magazine . not even half of the magazine is ad free ! ! ! ! i bought this to keep my son busy on a flight , and he looked at it maybe two minutes . i wondered why , since he loves everything else nick , so i looked inside for myself . boy was i dissapointed . instead of the quality children 's material i had hoped for , it was just ad after ad . i 'm glad i only bought one issue in the airport , instead of being one of the unfortunate people to purchase an entire subscription before seeing it 's lack of content . if you want a great children 's magazine , go for ladybug for younger children and cricket for older children . they are both high quality and they are n't stuffed full of advertisements like nick
1	this is definately a must buy for every ps2 fan . great reviews on popular current games , giving strong points and weak points for each reviewed game , previews on popular upcoming games , and some very helpful tips for your more popular games . note the word `` popular '' as this magazine will not cover every single game out there . comical captions here and there also make it a pleasure to read . throw in the annual swimsuit issue which the previous reviewer mentioned , opinion pages and fan art , and there should be nothing stopping a serious ps2 gamer from subscribing to this magazine
0	my dad bought this magazine for my mom and i usually pick up the copies to browse them . that is all both my mom in her fifties and i in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke . it is not that special it is chucked full of ads . the cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information . i find this magazine a waste of our money . it will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription . my mom has already stated that .
0	i had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until i bought one from our local super market . i was surprised at the difference that i had already paid to order from amazon and what it was there . i canceled my order and ordered from them . some items are much less on amazon and some are much more . you just have to be careful . a magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from .
0	self what ? the entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page . their product placements went from `` convenient and subtle '' to obviously pandering to their revenue sources . plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain could n't relate . i once enjoyed self and their monthly self-help plans . their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing
0	i got charged for this and havent gotten it . what bulls**
0	let me first say i am one of martha stewart 's biggest fans ! i have enjoyed msl magazine for years and loved the format of the `` old '' show ( the new one is taking awhile to get used to ) . i jumped at body and soul when it first came out , but have been repeatedly disappointed in the obvious exclusion of anything `` male '' in the articles . not to mention , the articles on relationships and love have never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , and just plain stupid from a marketing standpoint . why exclude men and gay people ? i have also noticed there are no ads from advertisers marketing to men either . most if not all of the articles are nothing more than `` new age '' pablum , either `` borrowed '' or stolen from much better magazines such as alternative medicine . do n't waste your time or money on this one . this is n't even good enough to line my cat 's litter box
0	flipping through the pages of writer 's digest at a local bookstore , i found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting , especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer . so i decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that i realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine . since i have subscribed online directly through wd 's website in jan 2005 , i have received only a few issues . in the first few months for almost half a year , i received no issues at all . it was only later then when i e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me . the annoying thing is that even though i have e-mailed wd a few times on this problem , they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription . how does this tackle the root of the problem ? if they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service , they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers ' option . ironically , i received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter . logistic problems aside , the magazine does have its plus points . in the issues , there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing , but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well . occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work , their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration . all this from a range of authors from a range of genres . essentially , the business of writing is also not left out . however , the magazine is not one fraught without problems . the problem with wd is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered . each article though containing valuable tips on writing , does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented . in addition , because of its range , it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently , which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers . sometimes , it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues . this for example , can be seen in the amount of publishers ' addresses that they offer . at most , each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses . there is nothing wrong with this , but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a writer 's market collection of publishers ( and agencies ) addresses collected into one ? and ironically again , the same company does publish a 'writer 's market ' collection which is of excellent quality annually . that said , the same problem - the lack of information and depth , is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well . to make matters worse , every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times . writers want to organise their time and information , not add on to it . if you want are thinking of subscribing to wd , do consider the alternatives that are currently available . writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think . however , if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life , than this magazine might be for you . but do your research first
0	we had a subscription to this magazine and it 's a pretty good one for the kids , albeit woefully thin . i found it too expensive for the few pages the magazine has and did not renew it . after ignoring the standard renewal pleas , yesterday i found in my mailbox a letter ( with subscription invoice attached , of course ) stating that my account was `` seriously past due '' and that `` further action is pending '' on my `` delinquent '' account . for those getting similar notices , i found this number to call : 1-800-825-2821 the lady i spoke with said she cancelled the 'unathorized order ' ... we shall see if i receive any other notices . it really is a shame that the tactics of the subscription services overshadow the actual product
0	i like to read cook 's illustrated at the library . their magazine is much too expensive for the small amount of recipes included within . i like the tips sent in by readers , and some of the product reviews . i have found that most of their recipes are very involved -- nitpicky , to be kind . the lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried from their `` america 's test kitchen '' cookbook -- calls for cooking cornstarch in water , cooling it , and then beating the solution into the meringue . supposedly this keeps the meringue from destabilizing . all that happened in my kitchen was i found little lumps of cornstarch glue at the bottom of my mixing bowl while scraping out the meringue . i have made meringue before without cornstarch , and ca n't help thinking this is an extra step that is n't neccessary . their `` best '' brownies are good , but i can make equally good brownies without all the extra steps involved in melting chocolate and cooling it , etc . if you 're looking for easy , fool proof recipes , that do n't take a gazillion steps and are n't fussy about exactly what ingredients you use , this is n't the magazine for you
1	i live in one of the `` red states '' in the deep south . therefore , unfortunately , quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find . but , fortunately , yoga journal is delivered to my area , providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that i have received through the years . however i agree with other readers , i do n't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream ~ ( who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice ? ) i also do not care for the models they use is this publication , most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the senior prom ! there are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on shiva rea , ana forrest or one of the iyengar family members but for the most part , this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young , skinny women , what a shame . having said that , there is alot of good material here , you just have to get past the aforementioned . there is some very good advice on fitness , nutrition and health , athletic injuries ~ from hatha yoga and other forms of exercise . there is also many articles on yogic philosophy and spirituality and living our yoga by bringing it into everyday life . all in all , a decent publication , especially if quality yoga studios and instructors are scarce in your area .
1	uncut is without a doubt the best music mag in the world right now ... .but why on earth would anyone buy 12 issues for the price of 15 ? this mag is 8 bucks in any of the stores mentioned in the other reviews here , not 11 an issue which is what this subscription breaks down to ... .whats up with that ? also , if you get a subscription direct from uncut 's wesite , it 's literally half the price they 're selling it for here
0	oh those were the days , when i was in college , reading my first issues and then subscribing . there were great things to be found in its pages , columns by brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . the great struggle with the soviet union was going into a critical stage . it seemed nr was so on the right track . and it was wonderful to read , at least from about 1979 to 1983 . but then it became for a while duller . it had some periods of recrudescence , such as under the editorship of john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began to dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i 've really discovered of late is how badly the neo-con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine . we 've got in the 50th anniversary issue a call by midge dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in iraq . really something has happened to the magazine , a sinister force has entrenched itself there . what is that force ? well , go to come-and-hear.com and you will begin to learn part of the picture , especially when you read the material by elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley 's they dare to speak out , which details the israeli lobby 's domination of our congress . nr was once a courageous conservative magazine , but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing . wfb should know better , and maybe he does . if he does n't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! and neo-conned again ! , and then he should listen to tony martin 's talk given to the ihr on a certain group 's tactics deployed to suppress free speech . what has inspired me to write this review is wfb 's recent column on the incarceration of david irving . it ends in a disgusting gloating . wfb has fallen into an evil trap , and so has the magazine he used to run . what has happened to the christian faith of people like buckley ? he now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group ... and you , mr. lowry , come on now : read widely and deeply and do n't be afraid of reading the talmud and about the israeli lobby . once you do , maybe you 'll develop the strength to think outside the box . we 're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet .
1	the wsj has always been required reading for business people and finance wonks , but in the past several years the whole thing -- reporting , layout , editorials -- has been overhauled and the result is one of the best general newspapers in america . first of all , business , economics , finance , etc . are extremely important to everyone whether their profession involves these things or not . everyone 's lives are shaped by these things and it is important to understand them . second of all , a thoughtful couterpoint to the `` liberal media '' has long been lacking and the wsj editorials fill the need ... read both the wsj and the new york times every day and you will likley hear two , thoughtful but opposing sides of all the major issues confronting our nation and world , from which you can begin to develop your own independent view . i can not recommend strongly enough that everyone subscribe to and read the wsj every ( week ) day
0	my family received this magazine for years , but recently we have decided not to re-new our subscription . this used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue . at this point , nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements -- this is n't the real science magazine it claims to be , and is a waste of money . the content is not all that great . the articles are often extremely short , too short for even a pre-teen audience . my kids often wished that this magazine included more serious science topics , and not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much of the magazine is full of `` fluff '' -- things like word searches and picture matching games , which did n't interest my children . the content might be okay for 7-8 year olds and children at slightly lower reading levels , but older children will be bored . all in all , i 'd recommend that you simply get the regular , adult version of national geographic . though the articles might be too complex for children , the pictures will make up for what they ca n't read . if you 're looking for more of a children's-oriented magazine , you 're better off with muse , a high quality general science magazine that is published by the smithsonian museum in washington , dc . however , muse caters to a slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 and up .
1	this magazine is totally awesome . from the excellent software on the disk , to the freakin-awesome reviews , to the silly humor and funny letters on the back pages , this magazine is for any mac user who want 's more than the professional macworld can give projecting humor into a computer magazine is not something many editors can do , bu rik myslewski ( spelling ? ) does a great job . i totally recommend it
1	this is the best artist 's magazine being published . i have had subscriptions to them all at one time or another . i have been a subscriber for at least ten years now . it 's the only magazine that i can actually use in a class on how to : my students learn from the articles , and so do i ! k.j . murra
0	i am not alone here when i say that knit 'n style is a joke to most knitters . myself and my knitting friends agree that it 's evidence that someone , somewhere , is seriously deluded if they think that these patterns are what the average knitter is yearning to make . i ca n't help but believe that if you ca n't get published in a worthwhile knitting magazine then you go to knit 'n style . because , seriously , they 'll take anything and try to sell it to poor unsuspecting knitters . save yourself the money and flip through this magazine if you see it on the shelf somewhere . you may get lucky and find one pattern that 's worth making in a single issue ... but then again , you may not . i suggest interweave knits , family circle easy knits , or vogue knitting if you want patterns you 'll actually want to wear .
1	this wonderful magazine made me a good cook . period . each issue considers upcoming holidays plus what fruits and veggies are in season and provides a ton of new recipes . my family never knows that the recipes are light and i 'm actually somewhat happy about sitting down and planning out meals . the recipes are also a mix of complicated and simple , fruit and desert , main dishes and salads . i buy subscriptions as gifts . plus , there 's not one iota of advertising in this beautifully photographed magazine . refreshing ! mary in p
1	i really enjoyed the first issue . sure , it is about high end products . however , this mother is happy to find an alternative to pastels and winnie the pooh .
0	i too have stacks of organic gardening and farming . i love to go back and visit robert rodale . too bad it has become a political bullypulpit . i would not subscribe again with out a major change
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
1	this magazine is great ! ! ! the weddings magazine is for the bride who wants great ideas and advice for a stylish and elegant wedding . the magazine includes great articles for wedding tips , sanity savers and after the wedding advice . weddings does contain advertisements for attire , but that is not their only service . this magazine also includes wonderful `` real wedding '' stories that are inspiring and give great ideas for your own wedding . i highly recommend this magazine for a more mature bride , or for a bride who already has picked out her dress but still wants great wedding ideas
1	i 've actually met people who have said , `` i 'm too old to learn new things . '' and younger folk who have said , `` that 's too much like being in class . '' if you 're one of these people , do n't bother with mental floss magazine , or with going to school any more , or for that matter , with continuing to be alive in the first place . living is learning , and this magazine helps edify and entertain you while you 're doing all that living and learning . most highly recommended . but if you like staying stupid , you 're probably not reading this . carry on , then . p.s . to the person who complained that the editors correct their previous mistakes and clarify their obfuscations in each issue : you 'd prefer the wide variety of publications and tv `` news '' shows which do n't ever acknowledge human error ? good luck with that
0	i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents ' subscription . it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about . frankly , the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack ; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters . a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers -- to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story -- any future coverage is designed to prove time 's initial position correct . the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event ; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories -- '' we told you so , we told you so . '' even worse , the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story . ca n't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn ? out of sight , out of mind is the mantra ... in fact , i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media ; newspapers are failing , television news ca n't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis . neutrality is dead . frankly , i do n't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant . time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states -- no more . iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page . african states are making vast strides towards democracy , we get an article about nigerian computer fraud . russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy , but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq . japan , one of the world 's most influential cultures , in the week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein 's puerile take on pornography and social deviants . but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks : how in the hell did our world become boring ? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer ? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage -- educate the reader about the world in which we live ; do n't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week . time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine , if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
1	this is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures . they are usually seasonal meaning 4-5 issues a year . this particular magazine is mostly black white pictures . at least the issues i 've bought were . this is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut . a majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above . this is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait
1	as a subscriber to martha stewarts magazines i have to admit this has become my favorite , simply because its concise and interesting to boot . love the week end dinner section , as well as the recipe index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when i am looking for something quick to consider fixing , but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine . some of the other regular features that i like and find helpful are the cooking for one section , since as a widow i hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas . also like the wine basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that i now like trying . in season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season , which makes shopping and cooking easier . the size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so i can recheck it while shopping to see what items i have highlighted to pick up . this is also a great magazine for couples , singles of all ages , which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class , 2.5 children homes . and ... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue
1	this magazine is one of my nightly treats ! i take it with me to bed and read it until i fell asleep , dreaming about the vacations awaiting me . this great magazine covers just anywhere in the world . i have learnt a lot about travelling . i even love it 's advertisements ( the vacation packages )
1	i 've received the whole dog journal for the past year . i have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements . it 's pure holistic news , information , health , nutrition , training , food testing , and anything else pertaining to dogs ! i would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned . one thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing . it 's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date , helpful , and necessary . with the whole dog journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd-rom . called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at $ 19.95 that there would be no monthly cd-rom . they charged us another $ 10 to have the monthly cd-rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues . but that cd-rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine . you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine , but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd-rom . it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine
1	i picked up a copy of health at my local grocery store , mostly out of curiosity . i found myself enjoying it enough so that i will be ordering a subscription . here 's why : 1.it encompasses every facet of health , not just diet or exercise . as one reviewer noted , it is broken down into categories : looks , living , moving , feeling , and flavor ( it was just redone ) . the articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable . i particularly enjoy the feeling and living sections , as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines . 2 . unlike many other magazines , i found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine . i , like most others , enjoy getting the most for my money . while everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a `` good '' magazine , this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house
1	this magazine transports you to a different world . every issue is a wish-book , with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month , or crafts to do over your next long weekend , or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room . well , in my life , years go by and i dream on . but just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped , negative , angry thoughts . i will never laugh at `` crafty '' people again . i will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside , but the dreams are sweet . the expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating , but then you have gardening , cooking , baking , furniture , decorating , beading , anything do-it-yourself . martha is truly a wonder woman . worth every cent
1	the first copy of the magazine my wife received was a two month old copy of the magazine when the current magazine issue was on the newstand , the second issue came on time but the third issue has yet to arrive as the current issue has been sitting on the magazine shelf for weeks . the distribution of this very good product is very inconsistent ... . maybe i can cancel my subscription and take a money lost and get this superior magazine from the magazine store
0	as a practicing photographer and not a collector , i 've been very disappointed with b on the few occasions it 's crossed my desk ( i 've never had a subscription , so i 'm basing this on just the few issues i 've seen ) . quality wise , the last issue i received was poorly printed - it contained streaks through the images and rampant misregistration , among other things . the paper is unimpressive as is the printing itself - the line-screen looks quite course . in a full-colour magazine , it would be fine , but for one in which everything is in monochrome , i would expect that they would print stochastically or at a higher resolution etc . in terms of content , every time i 've seen this magazine it has been filled with work which is typically very well-executed technically but un-innovative and un-inspirational , at least to me . most of it is of the hobbyist/dedicated amateur variety , with few capital-a artists or professionals . stereotypical nature and bodyscape-style photos seem to dominate , with few examples of conceptual , thematic or `high art ' work , and i 've never seen any fashion or photo-journalism either . we could use more non-technical photography magazines , but b caters to an audience obsessed with traditionalism and the imitation of old masters such as cartier-bresson and ansel adams . ps : reading body copy set in futura with tight leading is a real pain
0	i 've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine . something happened to them in early 2006 - they 've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something . this magazine is absolutely terrible now . all ads , fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue , and the hilarious articles are now long gone . my last two issues ( sept and oct ) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox . i 'm canceling my subscription .
0	do not order mentle floss magazin . it preetends to be smart but it 's just a teaz . covers intersting toppics , aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng . each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu . whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself ? like ths revue , it dos n't live upto it 's claims .
0	gee , i guess i really ca n't rate it . i ordered it on august 9th , and still have not recieved it as of november 3rd . guess i 'll know better then to order through amazon again
0	i received this magazine as a gift ... and i will not renew . articles are very short and refer you to websites , telephone numbers , etc . for more information . why so little information in the magazine itself ? additionally , there is a load of advertising : take that out of the equation and the magazine would only be a few pages long . for my money , there is much more available elsewhere , including a `` google '' search . waste of paper , imho
0	i subscibe to this magazine . will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical . it is way overpriced even with the amazom , and others discount
1	some people may not want to hear the truth about professional bodybuilding , like the guy who gave this magazine 1 star . to people like him i say continue living in your fantasy world and go read muscle and fitness . there you can keep believing that the pro 's get to be 280 @ 3 % body fat by using creatine . as for the rest of us who do not live in the land of oz we can all benefit from the no-nonsense scientific articles put forth in muscular development . this is the best magazine to read if you really want to know how to get freaky big . the beginning of the magazine is filled with excerpts from various medical and scientific journals and the articles that follow give you some great advice on `roids , supplements , contest prep , dieting and training . by far the best magazine in the business
1	each issue piles on the terror . do n't read this late at night ! what i truly enjoy is the variety of stories . it 's not just for horror fans , folks . some of these tales are suspenseful and others just leave you sitting there thinking , `` what the f* % k ? that did not just happen ! '' i have a lifetime subscription so i guess that means i 'm takin ' it to the grave ... ... .and they 'll still deliver ! ! !
0	i sir still did not received any fancy food and culinary products magazine
0	ordered my wife a subscription last christmas . recieved 2 issues , never got the rest of them . i 'll never order magazines through amazon again .
1	alrightly . folks it does n't get any better than this . this magazine blends humor with serious reviewing . they will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite - like me ! anyhow , i 've read this magazine for a while and i 've never been disappointed . the `` ask the 800 lbs . gorilla '' section is a riot . the bottomline gamer this is an unbiased , not corporatly owned ( like opm , and xbox magazine ) and a pleasing magazine to read . anyone `` hooked '' on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a psm and get a subscription .
0	as a child i remember finding this magazine at my doctor 's office and reading it because it was the only thing available . it has not changed much . there are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content . this magazine will neither stretch your child 's mind nor keep him entertained . it only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen . in the coming era of global connection , children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them . only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia
0	i flip through time every now and again at the barber shop . sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change , people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists . for the most part , since time receives most of its revenues from big business advertisements , it ca n't challenge the establishment as it needs to . so instead i read magazines like z , utne , mother jones , the progressive , the sun , earth island and the new internationalist
0	a great magazine . i had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago . i paid $ 104 for the 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly the price in the us has skyrocketed astronomically . i can go to any music store or a borders/barnes and noble and buy each individual magazine for anywhere from $ 8/issue to $ 9/issue typically , and i have never seen it more than $ 9/issue . however , suddenly the subscription they have is like $ 13 an issue , which is outrageous . it 's not amazon 's doing either , i was a subscriber for 2 years and this same thing happened to me . they asked me to come back at a lower rate ( something like $ 99/year ) , which is still $ 8.25 an issue . sure that 's might be a bit cheaper ( about 25 cents an issue on the average price above ) than buying each one in the store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially at tthat price . the upside is that uncut is far and away the best music/movie magazine in the world . i 'd say about 60-70 % of the issues i would have bought in the store when i was a subscriber . but until they begin printing the magazine in the states , it 's just not worth a subscription . the writing of the magazine is superb . brilliant and varied writing throughout . each magazine is about as big as a small book too , and of them i 'd read a good 80 % of the magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles about artists i could care less about , because the articles were so well written ) , but the price is way too high to subscribe . it 's a shame too . rolling stone is nowhere close to being as good as uncut , and although mojo and q are strong , they ca n't hold the candle to it either . the only blemish on the magazine itself ( for all you who might want to buy a single issue ) is that the covers tend to repeat every 3-4 months , and i mean how much beatles can i read ( and i 'm in the upper 5 % of beatle freaks out there ) . still the magazine is well worth it , the subscription price is too incredibly high though to recommend in any circumstances . i would think this would be a great market to move into in the us if i was in that position . i do n't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would do away with the `` free cd '' bonus too . aside from a few listens and the novelty of it all ( the free cd was a good incentive to make me interested a few years back ) , the cd 's get old quick , and after a while i would toss them out after a quick preview . summary : wait until/if the price drops , but do n't subscribe . it 's too expensive , and much cheaper to buy each magazine individually . the magazine itself though is 5 stars and almost always great
1	as a cooking school instructor , i believe there are only four pieces of reading material a home cook needs : `` fine cooking '' , corriher 's `` cookwise '' , `` the food lover 's companion '' , and goldstein 's `` wine lover 's cookbook '' . your magazine has it all : excellent cooking tips ; first-rate articles rating various appliances and cooking tools ; excellent pictures detailing procedures ; and recipes that are error-free with ingredients listed in the order in which they are used in the instructions ( a pet peeve of mine ! ) . i agree with a recent review stating that the level of difficulty in your recipes encourages stretching one 's cooking abilities but not to the poit of giving up . in the past years i have really liked that you have highlighted a small grower or breeder on the back cover -- one on goat cheese and another on apples come to mind . to all the editors and contributors : keep up the wonderful work
0	i was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication . it was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines . over the years things changed . columnists died or moved on . editorial directions were switched . articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant in the marketplace , `` outdoor photographer '' was in the vanguard , pushing every gadget and photoshop manipulation plug-in that popped up . the magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be ) . what i thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film ( ! ? ) , a lot of large format guys , occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non-existent . at some point , my interest in this garbage lapsed before my subscription . the magazine made a once monthly trip from the mailbox to the trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . `` outdoor photographer '' impresses people who measure quality photography by whether or not the equipment used in production cost the equivalent of the gross national product of small third world countries . it offers little in the way of nutrition to a hungry mind . it 's empty calories , just making you want more and more while starving your potential . it truly is wretched .
1	fortune is the best business magazine i 've ever read . the articles are insightful and well-written -- informative without being dry
0	i would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine is n't worthy of its title . i subscribed before reading review , i was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read , though some stories are interesting i 'm sure i 'd be able to find them in other magazines like vogue or cosmo . and there is plenty of ads , probably more than stories . and much like other reviewers when i first ordered it , it took forever for the first issue to arrive , now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course
1	this is a great magazine ! i love the beautiful pictures . . . even if i 'm not looking for a project - this is enjoyable just to look through . i really love the fact that there are no advertisments - just lots of helpful information with a very easy and relaxing layout - it has a very neighborly feel to it . also - since it only comes bi-monthly , there is just enough time between issues to look forward to the next
0	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to `` take a ride '' on the creativity of others . my advice : do not purchase , read , or advertise in this third-rate publication . there is little more credibility or validity than watching `` jerry springer '' . please , do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only
1	my husband is a culinary student , so i ordered this magazine subscription . he looks forward to each issue , and is always finding ideas when he reads fw . i know we 'll subscribe for many years to come . this is a fun magazine for those who enjoy cooking , both at home or in a professional setting
0	the problem with computer shopper is , it 's neither a serious trade magazine like pc mag , or a shopper 's paradise like its former self was . if you want hardware tips , maximum pc is way better . you can find pretty much everything in computer shopper for free on the web ..
1	bell'italia is an italian-language magazine that is to be read and savored and then saved for when you actually get to visit the areas described . the photos and the narratives are excellent and they highlight not just those cities that are famous but those places that many tourists never get to see and that are just as deserving . moreover , in the more famous cities like venice and florence , the places presented are often those that do not get much notice . in addition , the magazine highlights those restaurants and events in the area that will make the visit even more exciting . i have been a faithful subscriber for the past 6 years and never miss an issue
1	as a potential interior designer , i find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest . i have a subscription and i find that studying the designers , the styles and the themes i have learned so much about the work of a designer . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color , fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors
0	while waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month ( july 2005 ) , i read through what i thought would be the familiar redbook magazine of the past . instead , i was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described . another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing . i felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read . i am age 48 , college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers . i would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice , nor do i think it appropriate for a magazine such as redbook . parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes . it has changed
0	... because that 's all this magazine is : an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who are n't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet . do n't be fooled by the venerable `` national geographic '' name : this publications pays only the briefest lip service to educational content . when my son received it as a gift i was shocked to see that the ads were virtually indistiguishable from the articles . and in fact , the ads were often much more visually interesting . the photos were excellent , i must admit . but the layout was jazzed up to the point of absurdity , as if designed to play to kids with minuscule attention spans . the science facts were sound , but again , the articles were cut absurdly short , more like squibs and factoids than actual articles , as if the editors believe that kids could n't possibly focus on one topic long enough to actually read more than 250 words about it ... or maybe because they did n't want to distract the kids from all that tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page . as an editor and a parent , i am appalled by this magazine and would not recommend it to anyone . national geographic should be ashamed of itself for pushing this kind of junk on young readers . avoid this publication like the plague .
0	the magazine is very nice with color pictures and recipes that look okay , but that ingredients are either rare or expensive , the magazine is too fancy , and it 's hard to find what the recipe is like . they do n't put a review , you have to tell for yourself . and plus if it does n't have a picture , you have to guess what 's in it . i rate it one star . i 'd rate it a half star if there was such thing , but there is n't . i would n't buy this magazine
1	this is my new favorite magazine ! ! it 's so edgy and hip ! i love reading about all the hot new clubs and trends going on . one2one living definitely keeps me up-to-date with what is going on in the singles ' world and gives me new hot spots to go out to meet new people
0	i have never received a copy of this magazine that i ordered in august of last year ! they did n't hesitate to take my money though ! i have no idea if the magazine has any redeemable articles in it at all
1	most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite . this is the only weekly newsmag i can stand to read , and i love to read it . us news is a grab bag of topics , international is excellent ( vs. other us sources of news ) , finance business is excellent , science is a grab bag , books arts is quite good , and the periodic special reports are great . cheeky and clear , a delight to read . bring your skepticism , though , because the reporters columnists are not shy about taking a position , and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion .
1	i have been getting this magazine for a year now . i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis . the pictures are pretty . the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed . the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store . there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters . so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them .
1	i have subscribed for years to this - in my opinion , the hand's-down best , most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available . practical , solidly researched , non-preachy and impeccably edited , it provides even-handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog 's happiness , well-being and ability to be a good companion . the annual dog-food ratings alone are worth the subscription price . every constituency should be as well-served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one
0	just from picking up this mag in the store , and reading their spin-off `` pocket gaming '' , i have concluded that this magazine is pure rubbish , i would n't waste my money subscribing
0	time magazine named george bush as person of the year , despite the economic , international and ecological damage he has done and will continue to do over the next four years . speak and be heard . cancel your subscription .
0	i know apr is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there , and i think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine , but it 's more of the national enquirer of poetry magazines . it 's a large , newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles . you 'd be better off subscribing to poetry , the hudson review , the texas review , tar river poetry , or any number of other journals
0	i had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample . it is a lovely magazine , beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about `` other coasts '' ( besides east and west ) . but , at least with the most recent issue , in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian . even the advertisements had only white people ( save for one about vacationing in mexico that had some cute mexican children in it ) . while i doubt this is intentional , i would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue . there are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about
0	when i was 9 i loved this magazine . it seemed so gown-up to be reading this when my friends were still playing dolls . now when i read it all i find is trash . the magazine dose n't have one useful article in it . unlike seventeen or cosmogirl ! there are no real life stories or health articles just trash about stars . all the quizzes are the same thing . they repeat and repeat and repeat . and about the stars . puh-leeze ! i do n't care if hilary duff is dating joel or not , nor do i want to know if ashlee simson dies her hair herself or goes to a salon . i do n't reccomend this magazine to anyone . if you have nothing to do than go ahead and read it , but you wo n't enjoy it if you 've ever read a real magazine like seventeen or ellegirl
0	great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it 's free - but not worth your money to own . i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here . oh , once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine , but not consistently . the home section is n't that inspirational either . go for it if it 's free , but if it 's not , do n't buy it
0	i never bought gq back in my 20s because for one thing , i never thought of myself as a clothes-horse . also , i actually took the g in gq to mean that it was actually for gentlemen , ie , sipping champagne on a yacht pass me the the caviar type gentlemen . well , after now having reached a `` certain age '' i find myself going back and forth between esquire and gq and find that in many cases , neither are exactly right for me . however , i think i 've bought my last episode of gq . the 2006 `` interview '' with will ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs , and then it became an excercise in self referentialism , disguised as an attempt at wit . also , the politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-bush administration , which would be ok except for the fact that i 'm not reading gq for political content . there are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty , and when i find it in gq , its just tiresome . frequently , swipes at bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article , as if the editor decided that a jab at bush and his policies might help the piece , regardless of its content . not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display ? $ 800 tennis shoes ? i fear that i will be an esquire reader - i ca n't bear to become a `` men 's best life '' subscriber just yet
0	if you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead . if you want better exercises and articles look to oxygen or women 's m
1	i guess i do n't have the agendas of other reviewers . i prefer to use organic foods , healthcare , and body products , and find this magazine offers much useful information on alternatives to conventional offerings . i am not familiar with the `` old '' natural health magazine , maybe it was more `` earthy-crunchy '' or something , but i found nothing offensive in the `` new '' format . i would recommend this magazine to my mother and my siblings and friends , who i 'd like to see dip their toes into the world of natural health/beauty/food products . just be aware that not everything in here is purely organic . i find this magazine much less offensive than `` organic style '' , which in its last issue had models wearing leather coats , uber expensive consumer goods , and advertising from merchandisers who are definitely not on the organic band wagon
1	great magazine for families with kids ! my son loves all of the activities that can be done ! great price too
1	my initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge , and full of ads . i also read vogue , though , and to be honest , w has less ads in it . w convieniently avoids the snotty air of harper 's bazaar and vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in cosmopolitan , redbook , and marie claire , and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of instyle . this magazine has excellent layouts , and from what i 've read thus far , excellent-and very different-stories . as a regular vogue reader , i 'm used to reading about older designers like coco chanel , the versace and prada lines , and reading about a small smattering of socialites , like aerin lauder , paris hilton , jemma kidd , victoria traina . what is different about w is that it profiles the new and the modern . an article in the september issue profiled kate spade and her new line . other articles talked , almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites , meanwhile talking about , in an article aptly titled `` a bag called it '' the trend of statement purses and their proper place . w is also similar to vogue that in addition to the good layouts , it has even better photography , there are no photoshopped to death photos in here , and if they are , this student ca n't find them . what i like most about w is its sarcastic wit , something that is lost in most magazines , many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man , worship teri hatcher , or read dumbed down articles .
1	i do n't know what planet that guy is from who is saying below that he had to wait a long time , if he bought a pair of glasses he would notice that you have to wait for 12-16 weeks for every magazine you order from amazon . i had no problem with that -- i think the strand is a unique magazine . with fiction by such great writers as sir john mortimer , edward marston , and great interview with actor michael york . they also have fine articles one such article was about hercule poirot agatha christie . they are doing a great job
1	a passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years , concentrating on italian cooking for the last 10 years , writes this review . my favorite cookbooks are `` the professional chef '' by the culinary institute and `` culinary artistry '' . with more than 500 cookbooks in my collection i am typically disappointed by food magazines . if you like watching america 's test kitchen you will love this magazine . the editors cover equipment reviews , cookbooks , develop new recipes in their test kitchen and pass along reader 's tips . if you love to cook , give this magazine a chance . i think this magazine is better than the original that it emulated . in the june 2006 issue this magazine features the following articles : weeknight grilling rich , fudgy brownies two ways make room for basil a shortcut to juicy chicken chopped salads making the best quesadillas cuisine : vietnam berry tarts for those cooks that like to make everything , they even include a recipe for homemade tortilla shells ( a foreign process to those of use without latino heritage ) . the editors include an easy to use recipe index in the front of the magazine that is segmented by type of recipe ( appetizers , meat poultry , desserts , etc. ) . in short i have enjoyed every issue of this magazine that i have read . i would highly recommend this magazine to anyone that is serious about cooking or eating .
1	this is *the* magazine dedicated to advanced topics on the windows nt series ( nt , 2000 and xp ) . as the most popular and one of the best operating systems , windows nt series is incredibly complicated , and this magazine , issue after issue as well as on its cluttered website , gives you lots of detailed information . a lot of the contributors are respected programmers who really know windows internals . you also get the `` inside '' view of microsoft managers and developers from time to time . this is just one incredible resource for expert windows uers . ( after all , even an expert still has a lot to learn . ) now , this is going to make amazon mad : if you subscribe on windows it pro website , you save another $ 10 plus you get free access to their entire article archive
1	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine . the primary difference is the longer well-written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published , more up to date and more direct version of the other . it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail . if you do n't have a lot of time to read , policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy .
1	i have been a subscriber for some time . it 's a business publication that does not focus solely on wall street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for . think entrepreneur or general business topics and that 's business 2.0 . it does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball ' as well . monthly sections include `what 's next ' , `what works ' , `what 's cool ' . the articles are cutting edge in some cases , well researched and well written with an informal slant . they cover tech , marketing , product development , product design , ideas , new products and services , m 's and a wide range of general business topics . you will find out about new things before most of your coworkers , giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler , happy-hour settings . to go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s , the ads include autos like camry , land rover lr3 , mini cooper and even the porsche boxster , laptops , business productivity software like office 2003 , business products like copiers and printers , mobile calling plans , hp , credit cards and even lufthansa airline . so if you are not in this demographic , maybe they 're not targeting your demographic . why buy : you are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation ' of your career . you are entrepreneurial minded . you want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news . as a gift for someone with these interests
1	since first getting this mag from gamestop as one of those free add on things you get when you buy games there i have come to really like it . unlike other magazines who only seem to care about backing one system or another game informer talks about everything that is going on in the gaming world , even addressing the serious issues of children and m rated games
0	the editor 's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid lifestyle magazine , which you 'll enjoy only if you 're like her -- rich , creepily entitled , self-absorbed , and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining , but not really food or actual cooking itself .
1	i heard of this magazine even before i came to this country and it never disappointed me ever since i subscribed it . i valued it most among other photography magazines i subscribed to . the reason is that i find this magazine have real stuff . for equipment , it has a detailed and objective test . the articles are not just obscure evaluation u find elsewhere , for instance , it once said : ... based on our field and lab test , this amateur lens gives a better performance than its professional counterpart ... , whereas in other magazines , what u find probably is this lens is good , and that one is nice ... . for photo tips , it is more insightful than just sunny 16 or always use a tripod . u can find the photographer 's own consideration as to why put the composition this way but not that . in all , i think this magazine is for anyone who is interested in photography to begin and continue wit
0	it is beyond me why any pre-teen or teen would want to read this kind of magazine . i was reading this magazine a couple of weeks ago on a ski trip because my 13-year old friend happens to get it in her mail . the truth is , this magazine lacks substance . i do n't see why people even care what jojo 's friend thinks about her being a celebrity , how mk is recovering in the hospital from being anorexic or what jesse mccartney 's marital status is . leave the celebs alone ; let them live their life . i 've seen the same things printed in this magazine over and over . this magazine is shallow and is downright materialistic ( i.e . some articles that i have seen on various covers were `` get him to do anything you want ! `` , `` what 's jesse mccartney 's nickname ? '' and `` terrified of being alone ? '' ) . i do n't like most magazines , but if you want a mag with real substance , look forth for seventeen or cosmogirl ! magazine . and to the preteens -- skip this magazine . the editors write at a level that 2nd graders can understand . read anything but this -- your local newspaper , even national geographic ( one of my favorites ) . this magazine is $ 17 for 10 issues -- do n't you think that 's a bit pricey ? if you 're a parent , please do n't buy your daughter this mindless garbage . ca n't you find anything decent for your kids to read ?

1	we 've been getting discover for about a year from someone who gave my children a subscription ( but we ca n't recall from whom ) . that sub was nearly ended , so when my 13-year-old son said it 's his favorite magazine , i bought him a new subscription for his 14th birthday
1	i will always subscribe to this fabulous magazine . there is so much variety in each issue . i am amazed at how this magazine always get me interested in things that i have never even thought about before . and the way the articles are written , i feel like i am being entertained while i am being informed -- it 's awesome ! the mix is not just heavy subjects either -- there are always ighter-weight articles too , so i can pick up this magazine on any occasion when i 'm in any mood and i can always find something that i want to read about
0	i subscribed to forbes magazine for a year or two , and in general the content is good , but i cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons . ( a ) 33 % of the pages are all advertisements - what a waste of space , ( b ) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as i read the magazine , and ( b ) the classifieds in the back are `` not of interest '' to any real business person . if you do n't mind the ads and the fluff , then this magazine might be right for you ! it 's not for me . i give it 2 stars
1	i ordered this magazine for my grandmother , as we are both huge paula fans . we got the first issue and read it front to back several times . it is an awesome publication filled with recipes and pictures and stories about paula 's life . i think it really captures the feeling of paula deens show
0	i was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor 's office . i love instyle , lucky and other shopping mags , but the tone of this is mean and snooty . there are too many ads , and very little content . there 's a q section about sex after baby that 's just mean , threatening that if you do n't jump back in , `` one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing ... '' way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby . yuck .
1	i have always enjoyed marie claire . i do n't know why i took so long to actually get a subscription . it 's a well rounded magazine , and well suited for women who are younger and older
0	it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head . it skims the surface and is 'pop ' . anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world . again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world ( newsweek is exactly the same ) especially in the united states . time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice . the other irritating thing about time is it 's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious . subscribe to the economist , there are less pictures !

1	this is one of the best literary journals i have seen in years ! the content is broad and interesting ( a good mix of fiction and poetry ) , and it seemed like i had a new surprise in store for me every time i turned the page
0	i am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\ sure it would be good if i was ever to get one ? dave tuman new bern , nc
0	this definitely a magazine for gearheads . it 's pretty much just equipment reviews and advertisements . i would have given it a higher rating but for two things : 1 ) i do n't think i 've ever seen popular photography not love any piece of equipment . the reviews can still be useful if you 're just wondering what features the new gizmo has , but still , they ought to be a bit more critical if they 're going to be such a review based magazine . 2 ) many of the ads are from vendors with bad reputations . i believe they make some sort of claim about requiring a certain level of honesty from anyone they sell ad space from , but it sure does n't look like they have ever kicked anyone out of the magazine to me . so what do you have when you have a magazine full of uncritical reviews , the occasional beginnerish article about technique , and a lot ads from stores of dubious virtue ? at best a 2 star magazine
1	after been loaned this issue of june 2004 , by a committed , really genuine episcopalian , i was greatly impressed ! these creative , unique articles captured my imagination : `` what is power ? '' by sam keen ; `` taking the first step '' by anna lappe` ; `` accessing sacred energy , '' by judith orloff , md ; `` the making of a chaplain '' by karen o'brien ( so like the pages of my earlier verbatim in cpe ) . `` the best spiritual books '' are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by fred and mary ann brussat ! we surely agreed on the first few named : `` the heart of christianity '' marcus borg ; `` beyond belief '' elaine pagels ; `` the wisdom way of knowing '' cynthia bourgeault ; ++ `` the lord is my shepherd '' rabbi kushner+ `` the power of patience '' by m j ryan ! i am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating , artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for thought and reflection . retired chaplain fred w hood
0	harper 's bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine , but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription . true , each issue would be more expensive , but 1 ) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying , as some are thin and empty 2 ) they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue . i have only gotten one issue on time , to be honest .
0	i am sure this will be a great magazine , but i have not received my first issue yet
1	whether you are a technical guru or someone who 's emphasis is on the words , any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously will love american cinematographer . the official magazine of the american society of cinematographers , this magazine gives you in depth interviews with dps and directors on the technical approach towards the shooting of the picture . they cover not just lab soups and lighting techniques , but also the approach to the script , design notes on how to visually approach the script - in other words , a great detailed overview of how this particular crew of filmmakers went about creating the visual language of the film . and not just film - as technology advances , and more films are shot on video , this magazine gives the same great coverage to those pictures as well - from star wars to anniversary party . while it 's true that there are only so many films that ac can cover each issue but i think you 'll end up feeling like i do - that i wish they could cover them all
1	i actually make the recipes in this magazine . the recipes are simple but interesting . the nutritional information is also great . this is my favorite cooking magazine by far
1	i have not yet received my issue of creating keepsakes . i have viewed previous issues at stores and have enjoyed all the creative ideas and layouts .
0	have n't received this item . it has been almost 2 months
1	`` the writer '' is the premier magazine for writers of all varieties . kalmbach is known for publishing a great series of specialty periodicals , and this one is extremely well written and edited , as is appropriate for the subject matter . the magazine is best for aspiring writers of fiction , with the clear majority of column inches . poetry is also covered well , and nonfiction ( my area of interest ) , while covered , is definitely in third place . in the end , though , most techniques for fiction also help nonfiction authors and vice-versa : i read every issue cover to cover regardless of area of concentration because i have gleaned some of the best tips from articles that superficially seemed not to pertain to my writing . the magazine is very good at covering new developments in the publishing world , and features in-depth reporting on subjects like `` print on demand '' ( pod ) publishing . many articles concentrate on in-depth technique implementation , while the utilitarian short pieces that cut through grammatical tedium and stylistic methodologies reinforce the basics . if you are interested in writing as a professional or just for personal satisfaction , `` the writer '' is the magazine for you .
1	i 've been getting this magazine since it first came out years ago , and every issue is just as exciting as the first . it not only gives you the military aspect of events , but often goes into detail as to how and why these events occured , which is invaluable in itself . i ca n't wait for the next issue to come out , and wish it would come out more often . and the fact that it comes in hardcover format makes a nice presentation on my bookshelf . thank you mh
0	american photo began as a magazine devoted more to photography than to gear , as an alternative to the gear obsessed magazines like pop photo and photographic . it has evolved into a magazine that divides its pages between equipment obsession and cheesy `` glamour '' photography that tries for art and delivers soft core porn . no stars
1	i have subscribed to asimov 's for 15 years . it is the very best sci fi magazine out there . all the best authors that you have heard of and many that are undiscovered treasures . if you are a fan of short science fiction then you will not be disappointed
0	i have always enjoyed every issue of threads in the past . the new format / contents does not appeal to me . threads is now a beginner sewing magazine like many others on the market . thread 's was once a great magazine , the only one on the market for the intermediate and advanced sewers . the projects were wonderful and i and other 's i know kept every single issue . not now , there is n't really much in thread 's for the wearable art/advanced sewer . i will really miss the couture finishing techniqes and other articles with new ideas . these articles were much more detailed than any book . because of this detail a sewer with some experience could use these articles to become an advanced sewer more quickly than buying many books . i only gave the 2 star 's because it is a nice beginner magazine . if you are new to sewing this is a good magazine , but the more advanced sewer 's should pass this one up
0	... 1 ) i ca n't ; 2 ) on second thought , it deserves at least one star for having some silly , funny stuff that you do n't find in other magazines . that said , it is grossly overrated . how is it consistently in the top sellers list ? well , there are as many millions of folks with a below average iq as there are above average . it 's too bad they ca n't play up the silly humor a bit more while leaving the abhorrent juvenileness out . the images are generally trashy and sometimes airbrushed to the point that it looks fake and ridiculous -- they could improve the quality of the photos a lot . admit it , you would probably hide an issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected . does n't that say it all ? reconsider the standards you are setting for yourself , and respect your own brain , too
0	this is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your wish list address if you `` wish '' for magazines . my son changed his address in his amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city . amazon did not use this information to update his address within his wish list . when i ordered $ 138 worth of magazines from his wish list last december , amazon hid the street address `` for privacy '' - therefore i could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address . in november , i asked my son if he 'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any ! after i spoke with amazon , my son now gets a message when he goes to his wish list that his address does n't match the one in his account , so it 's clear amazon is now aware of this problem . the publisher will not redo this subscription for luerzers , saying the magazines were never returned to them , and amazon has not responded to my request for a refund
0	i 'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is . there 's nothing wrong with celebrity mags , but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially , it 's about as deep as an e ! true hollywood story about kato kaelin . i 've tried many times , but alas , this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it
1	i 've been a bw subscriber for 8 years now , and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is , i see at least 60 more years of subscription . bw is a very well balanced magazine focusing mainly on business trends and headline news . a majority of their articles are extremely informative , well written , and objective . if there is an opinion piece , it is clearly stated as `` commentary '' . i enjoy the `` economic viewpoint '' where it alternates between right and left wing economists ( hubbard for rep. , tyson for dems ) . bw is also forward thinking in writing about trend analysis and disecting what the future may bring . there is a good snippet of international business . a couple weaknesses of the magazine : -tech you column . the guy writes about the same category of gadgets over and over again ( mainly pda what not ) . i would like to see more articles about hdtv , laptops , desktops , software , etc . tech you appears to be written for either a road-warrior or a technophobe . -personal lifestyles section . seems like the magazine is catering towards a more upscale crowd , writing about exotic vacations and expensive wines that only either a very rich person or a very debt prone person could afford . i also find the magazine to be weak in covering the retail sector . i 'd like to read more full articles about companies average consumers deal with on a weekly basis . the kmart/sears deal was largely overshawdowed . all in all , if i could only choose one magazine to receive , this would be the one .
0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage , and recent years have only accelerated this trend . in the 60s and 70s , it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend ( originally it was considered quite conservative ) , but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance . as for its being part of the `` liberal '' media , this is inaccurate . recent coverage of the ( 2004 ) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person . the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered , except for one very brief article listing a few `` fact check '' points . instead , the cover story wa about new products and movies , a kind of sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan . it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election , but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office . in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment . the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush , but it 's still mostly bland and superficial . your money is better spent on the british magazine `` the economist '' which is far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint is conservative , it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics . `` the economist '' also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach to the news . time can still be entertaining to read , but i would n't take what they say too seriously . they tend to bend with the political wind
0	there was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking , tolerance , and openness to healthy , civil debate . no longer . and harper 's is a perfect symbol for all that ails the left . to call this magazine `` left leaning '' is a farce . it does n't lean ... it completely , totally , enthusiastically , and blindly tumbles and falls into the `` far left '' swamp . the tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan , reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of america . the quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years . this rag is about as credible now as the guardian , national enquirer , or , come to think of it , the new york times ! save your money , lol !
1	starting as a quartely publication , black book has vaulted to bi-monthly releases and the highest level a magazine can aspire to reach . the publishers have their finger on a pulse that pumps literary , fashion , music , entertainment and art style onto eye catching pages . i have n't missed an issue and never will
0	i agree with the others in that this magazine is too content-filled with the most irrelevant content ! the copy is way heavy , but few true words of wisdom . it showcases very little work by other graphic designers so if you 're looking to peruse the latest talent , definitely stick with ca or how

0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than $ 100 on babya outfits , etc . it is not a magazine for most of america , but rather for the elite , or those who wish to pretend they are . there are way too many ads , and insignificant articles . parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category .
1	in the years i have taken this magazine , i have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow 's news from the latest hot-spot in the world . so prescient , it is eery - if you have any interest in current events , news or foreign affairs , this journal is a must read . the contributors are a who 's who of politics , science and business in the world . often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration . for example , the last issue discussed avian flu virus . as a physician , i can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was . and now this stuff is on tv every day and i can amaze my patients with how much i know about the issue that no one else does . reading this will definitely make you look smart . try this experiment and see if i 'm right . this article is written in october 2005 , days after receiving the october issue with multiple articles about china written by chinese authors . of course that means that these articles are n't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what china wants us to believe . i predict that china will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months . so put this magazine to the test and see . one negative is that although the authors are bi-partisan regarding party , they are not `` conservative '' . you wo n't ever find pro-tariff , anti illegal immigration , isolationist , anti judicial activism or pro-life articles in here . indeed , regardless of which party an author supports , you can pretty much count on expanded government , especially one-world government presented as the solution . and lastly , some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted , obfuscated , diplomatic jargon . you will rarely find a simple , eloquent phrase , but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news . just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability . all in all , this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting-edge ideas . just realize that many of them may be wrong
1	i was in the travel industry for years , and found cn to be an excellent , albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations , and all other aspects of travel , whether upscale or backpack . yes , it is not encyclopaedic , and yes it is chock full of adverts . however , the latter brings the cost of publication , no doubt , and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue . their travel product ratings are next to none , and shortlists the selection process , allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions
1	this magazine is an interesting mix of pictures of hot women wearing very little , short articles on sexual improvement books , health , and beaty products . if any other these interest you ; i would highly recommend this mazagine .
1	under the radar and filter are the only music magazines i come near . i hear mojo is just as informative , renovative , and enjoyable , but i 'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres i ... do n't care much about . fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling `` indie '' /alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/ ! ! ! ! , take a gander at this . and the covers are slick and durable . they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table
0	i have not yet recieved this magazine , how could it be reviewed
1	there are many reasons to love this great magazine and a few reasons not to . one of the reasons not to is there many ads , but if you want to read what great writers write you have to make reading the new yorker on your top 10 list
0	i received this subscription as a trial , and found it one of the most boring publications that i have ever read . by the last few issues that i got , i was n't even looking at the pictures anymore . there are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life , which were very materialistic . at the end of every issue there were pictures of real-life wedding announcements . perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper , but it struck me as out of place in a magazine
1	a great magazine for digital camera users from beginner to expert . has great tips and information
0	i received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing . boy , am i glad i did n't subscribe ! the magazine is nothing but fluff - good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures - not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health .
0	i have not received even one issue yet , what seems to be the problem ? ? ? ? ? ? i am giving no stars whatsoever , and i demand an explanation
0	i subscribed to t+l for one year . my wife and i found the magazine to be uninformative and of little value when planning our travels . most of the magazine seems to be centered around places to go shopping and the photos that accompany the articles are artistic photos , usually of models wearing $ 1,000 outfits , instead of informative photos of the resorts or hotels . the recommended travel products tend to focus on $ 1,200 designer duffels which , while perhaps within reach of the target demographic , are unlikely to survive many trips through a major airport . in addition , my subscription came with an unrequested automatic renewal . i did n't enjoy the magazine and nearly every copy was in my recycle bin within 15 minutes of receiving it . however t+l decided that i would somehow like a renewal although i certainly never requested one . in my book , those are questionable and perhaps unethical business practices .
0	i purchased subscriptions to both `` ask '' and `` muse '' for my daughter ( 9 years old ) and am thrilled at the lack of advertising in those magazines . i subscribed to `` young rider , '' as my daughter is very much a horse lover . i was dismayed to find it full of advertisements . and not only that , but poor quality ads , irresponsible ads perpetuating gender stereotypes ( e.g. , males do not wear pink ) and blatant consumerism ( `` from hoof to toe , wear the brand . '' ) while i 'm using the magazine as a means for teaching media literacy , we certainly will not be resubscribing . as to the content , it does seem informative , especially for a beginning rider , though the writing is not particularly compelling . and the articles are hard to find amidst all the marketing , making it visually confusing . while my daughter picked up her first issue of `` ask , '' sat down and did not get up until she 'd read it cover to cover , she picked up `` young rider , '' glanced through it , tossed it back down and has not yet returned to her first issue . and this is a child who is horse crazy -- not much of a testimonial for a horse magazine
1	fhm is absolutely gorgeous ! hot and sexy covers , great entertainment and fashion info . men lifestyle is discussed in this magazine . make sure that you subscribe yearly to save up cost
1	i have found `` your dog '' very interesting and informative . i am glad i subscribed and plan to resubscribe . this is a no advertising ( which is very refreshing ) scientifically-based mag which is very helpful for dog lovers .
1	i do n't know if anyone else out there has noticed this , but jane magazine has gone through an a-m-a-z-i-n-g transformation ! i picked up the october issue this week , and was shocked to find out that it not only has gone through a visual transformation . ( it now looks a lot like a hip , european magazine-kind of like `` jalouse '' , my favorite french publication ) , but also , the information provided inside is really valuable and applicable to my lifestyle . ( i am 24 ) there 's tips for decorating your home with cool silkscreened rock posters , delicious recipes for dinner guests on a budget , and really great fashion coverage that is not at all cookie-cutter and formulaic like some of the other women 's books ( aka lucky , glamour , etc ) also , the voice of the writers is so clever , and funny-i would hang out with these girls ! ! anyway , i am not going to go on and on like a crazy person , but i was so excited that i wanted to share with u folks-follow my lead and pick up a copy ( or a subscription ) asap ! !
1	my son in law insists that i give him a subscription to this magazine every year for his birthday . he really looks forward to it .
1	xxl is much better than the source and vibe it will always be my favorite magazine keep it up xx
0	if you 're a teenage guitarist and want to learn nickelback , green day , and nu-metal songs , then this magazine is for you . there 's also some pretty good tips for beginners from time to time . but in the last several years the quality of the feature articles and interviews has gone steadily downhill , and there are far too many ads . as many people have said , sometimes it does n't seem to be geared towards musicians at all anymore . the smarmy , `` hipper than thou '' rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style of writing seems to be taking over the mag . and other styles of music such as blues , country , jazz , etc , are pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you 're a teenager and you see it on the newsstand and there 's a song in it you would like to learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine
0	i purchased a subscription as a gift last feb. and the recipient never recieved it ! instead they got a gift certificate from amazon and a vague explanation..
1	after reading several digital photography books , and going to grad school classes ... i found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country . there are many articles on artists , workshop-type tutorials , as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan . i believe this magazine has something for everyone ... from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost . in addition , i have found two other british publications , digital camera world , and digital photography techniques ( both at www.dcmag.co.uk ) , that i would strongly recommend for those who can afford them
1	that 's what j-14 stands for . it 's for teens pretty much yes . if you like gossip , posters , and info on your favorite celebs , music , and movies . i just started collecting them last september and i think their good . i do n't care abou the gossip that much but i like the rest of it . i 'm sick of seeing those kids off of high school musical though . i wish they would take them out of the magazine . especially zac efron ... blech . their good magazines though
1	this is a fantastic magazine . what i really enjoy about it is how often the featured homes are ones with small kids . they show it is possible to have great design that works well with young ones too . it 's comfortable , livable modern . now , if only we could find a way to import the products shown here to the u.s. !
1	since the early 80 's i have been a fan of cemetery dance magazine . it comes every other month full of short stories by popular and up and coming horror authors . the magazine also contains great movie and book reviews , advertising , and author interviews . i encourage any horror fan to check out their website ... the staff there is very friendly and helpful . on those hot summer days , it is a super mag to delve into and forget about the weather ! ! ! ! enjo
1	this magazine if full of fun fashion items ! it shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year ! its a definite go ! ! :
0	psychology today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman , but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements . i give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout , and a second star for hiring writers that do n't insult the reader 's intelligence by abusing alliteration ( unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults ) . however , the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people . i have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect , rather than simply a personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )
1	not only black + white is a great australian magazine , and of top quality . i used to buy it in bookstores here in new zealand , but they do n't seem to be available here anymore . i am not subscribing to it , but i 'd keep getting them if they were available in bookshops where i live . i emailed the publisher twice about this , but i did n't get any response . aside from that , this is a great mag ( yes , it has fine art nude pictorials as well as lots more ) and one that you would hang on to like a `` coffee table '' book rather than treat like a typical magazine . it has a thicker cover and pages than normal magazines too . for a magazine , you could almost rate it a 5 , but nothing beats a proper book ( no advertising , etc ) , so i rate this a 4 . aside from the photography , it also makes a good reference for page layout and typographical ideas as well , for anyone into desktop publishing
0	when i first started reading this magazine back in 2003 i thought `` oooh what a cool mag ! ! '' but clearly i was totally wrong . since 2003 seventeen has changed from a girly sophisticated mag appealing to girls just barely in their teens to to a cheap , overated , cliche` , piece of crap ! ! ! i 'd like to know what happened ! ! ! ! ! it 's super boring now . it has no style . all the sections are about health garbage boring global trash . hello ? what about the stars , movies , .. the music section sucks ! nothing is good anymore ! if you disagree with me your probably just as boring as it yourself . i hate it and i do not recomend this magazine . do n't read it ! ! you 'll be wasting your time
0	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me . there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..i dont recommend glamour at all .
0	i received my first `` issue '' of modern bride in the mail yesterday . it was just the cover of the magazine , nothing else ! now i 'll have to go through the trouble of ordering a replacement . do yourself a favor and just go to a news stand and buy one
1	my son looks forward to his ranger rick magazine . i am glad that we decided to go with ranger rick instead of the 4-6 year old magazine version . our 4 year old loves the pictures and he loves the information .
1	i have been reading health off and on since i was in high school in the late 1980s , and overall i love this magazine ! the articles are usually rather interesting , and there is always at least one long article that i find relevant to my life or curiosities . however , there are times when the topics/articles border on resembling cosmo and glamour rather than really being related to health . overall , i recommend health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health-related issues , but do n't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article
0	where are all of my magazine subscription first issues ? ? ? ? ? ? ? mar
1	as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine . i think it 's totally hot . i really like the fiction , and the guys are such cute young hotties ! some of them look a little `` mean '' for my taste - they look so challengingly at you , instead of invitingly , but then again , a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn i guess . very few , if any of them are over-beefed ( too muscular ) , and some of them are n't muscular at all , which means nice variety . the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i 've looked at - lots of first times , nothing really bizarre or violent . overall a cool magazine
0	i 've subscribed to self on-and-off for about 15 years , but have recently been feeling like i 've outgrown the magazine . the articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers . fine , but not for me anymore ! also , their subscription department is terrible ! my most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues , double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that ca n't quite pull themselves together .
1	i have loved the magazine for years and decided it would be smarter to subscribe . the first issue came a month earlier than i expected in perfect condition . this was a wonderful buying experience
1	i love this journal ! i am very interested in the very best for my pets and this is the place to find out about things like food and training . i found this at my college 's resource center for their veterinary technician program - so , it is highly recommended by more than just myself
0	this magazine recently ( april 05 ) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time . number 1 was the sing-along scene from magnolia . other moments in the top 10 included the credits from austin powers 3 and one of eugene levy 's quotes from american pie . keep in mind , these are the 100 greatest movie moments of all time . this mag/rag is nothing more than the film section of fhm stretched out to full-issue length . utter trash
0	recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and i could n't believe my eyes . the magazine is a skeleton of its former self , with slim stories and little science . bob guccione jr 's mag is not even that fun to read . on the happier side , the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations
0	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands . what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else ? i will never order a magazine from amazon again , i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead
0	why endure the months wait . get it from the source for the same price and you 'll get a sample issue before you have top commit to a subscriptio
0	i purchased subscription on december 23 , 2006 . trusted amazon to deliver a good service . the estimate for delivery was 4-6 weeks . now , it is march 7 , 2007 ; the magazine has never arrived ; the provider of subscriptions first kept promising `` any week now '' but now they say i would n't start my subscription until mid-april . no explanation why . can not cancel and get a refund of $ 150 . extremely disappointed . should have ordered directly - another french weekly , subscribed directed from the publisher a month ago and already received two issues . i am not even sure at this point i would receive my paid subscription for paris-match . i contacted the publisher and they told me they provide us subscriptions through a completely different agent . so , amazon , what do i do now about my subscription
0	interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it 's not quite what i expected . with a title like `` interview '' i read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews . it turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine , but it 's not the only one . there is substantial space given to fashion , movies , and other areas , too . some of these columns are worth an occasional look , but they failed to grab my attention . the writers seem to play it safe , and that includes the interview section . they do n't ask many daring or controversial questions . they keep it simple , asking questions about an entertainer 's latest album or movie , without delving much into their personal lives . interview has many general annoyances . my greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents . about half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads , with fashion , liquor , beer , and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue . the ads are everywhere , with the majority in the front pages of each issue . the table of contents is buried , and i find this very frustrating . the contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page , then a few pages later , proceeds to the remainder of the contents , which is the regular monthly features . what 's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents . it varies from one issue to the next , falling somewhere in the first half . interview also varies greatly in length . some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long . the shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way , minus any metal . this magazine centers on entertainers , fashion , music , and the like . you wo n't find any interviews with politicians , businessmen , etc . interview sticks strictly to entertainers , and that includes the regular monthly columns . you wo n't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry . you will find only articles about the stars themselves . interview 's only saving grace is the photography . it would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing . but in many ways , the photos are overemphasized and there is n't enough substance to the magazine . the articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material . overall , interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material . my subscription was free , and i 'm thankful that it was . besides a few nice photos for clothing , there is n't much to make this magazine worth the cost .
1	`` fortune '' is a classic on the newsstand , and is as vital and important today as ever . `` fortune '' generally caters to people with a managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world , the global and national economic climate , and forward-looking technology and trend information . each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story , like the enron trial , or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year . i do enjoy the articles where they rank things , but more than the rankings themselves , i am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings ; while i do n't always agree with the magazine , i do always find it good food for thought . the features are generally very polished and accurate , and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a ceo as to a college business student . i particularly appreciate the interviews that `` fortune '' has with key players in the financial industry , and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue . the magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like `` kiplinger 's . '' nonetheless , the investment advice and insight `` fortune '' offers should generally be held in high esteem . i also appreciate the coverage of key trends , and in particular want to note that `` fortune '' has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in america : coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader . many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money ; while there are several i would recommend , `` fortune '' remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends , and should be a part of everyone 's business library
1	i have reviewed two issues so far . the articles are practacal and challenging . well worth the investment for someone working on a manuscript
0	i used to love outburn magazine . i first discovered it when i came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain . the first thing i saw on the cover was vnv nation . i bought that issue and soon after that i ordered a subscription . what i loved about outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that are n't covered in the mainstream music magazines , namely those in the goth , ebm , synthpop , and industrial scene . unfortunately within the next year and a half , the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands , two genres i do n't give a rat 's behind about . i do n't know wtf happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music i would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to . just like alternative press , outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends
0	oh lord ! ! does anyone still read this ? ? i was a subscriber back in the early 70 's , when it was a folded up , newspaper.by and large , jann wenner let people run it , that knew how to . it is now , and has been nothing more than an ad choked , gossiping teen slick.right , like they are the ones with the money ! ! i wonder what they still pay raoul duke , to do ? ? ! ! ralph gleason has to be turning over in the grave
0	unfortunately as this subscription has not yet started i am not in a position to comment or review
0	the magazine is great ! the problem is , i am not receiving them . i ordered a subscription in january and have received 3 issues only ! ! ! all my other orders with amazon have been received , i have no idea what is happening with my magazine subscription . i wrote to amazon to ask if there was a way of tracking my order but have n't gotten a response
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
1	eqmm is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries . is every story exceptional , of course not and that 's unrealistic to expect it to be . the stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers . i think it 's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale . to address , some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer , look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover . if the publishers only produced great classic books , we would have only a handful of books each year , instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year . the pages smudge , but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like people or time or sports illustrated . at the current price , you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages . if you 're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of eqmm and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be
0	even if you 're a `` conservative , '' you got ta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around . if you like good writing , do n't even try this one . a `` one star '' is still too generous in my opinion .
1	now i dont usually write reviews for things , but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it . and i must say this is one of the best , if not the best music magazine out there . but before you go on if you like bands like simple plan or new found glory just stop and go read something else . this magazine is for indie rock fans or just plain rock . they give you reviews on at least 30 albums and have great interviews with artists . now this is not like `` spin '' who jumps on anything that is popular at the moment to make some money . i enjoyed reading this summers issue ( with death cab for cutie on the front ) so much that i ordered it the day i got the magazine . a must have for indie fans
0	it is a shame that such a good magazine lacks so much in customer service . i subscribed in 2005 and only received one ( 1 ) issue which was informative , well structured and beautifully illustrated . when i e-mailed the company to find out what had happened with the rest of my subscription , roseanne tully 's ( ceo publisher to intermezzo magazine ) response to my inquiry was that the next publication would be sent immediately and that `` the rest of the 6 issues would be delivered even if it takes more than a year '' . to date , i have not received a single issue since i made my complaint in march nor have i received a refund . if you 're a foodie as myself , and like to keep up with the trends in the culinary industry ; what good is it to subscribe to a publication that takes your money and does not deliver or delivers outdated magazines
0	i agree with ms hunters review , for me too many ads not enough depth on our relevant subjects
1	i like shape because it has great tips to help spice up a workout so you never get bored . there are great articles on places to stay , hike , relax , etc . as well , there are great inspirational stories
0	the magazine is not bad , marginal at best . to my surprise , i am now a member of a club . i also was surprised to receive the first of a series of gardening books ( mine to keep for a small fee ) . needless to say , the description for the magazine was not forthcoming with the additional items and obligations ( mailing the book back , etc ) . all i wanted was the magazine . i do n't like to feel like i was taken advantage of . please pass on this one . there are plenty of other good gardening magazines to order .
0	we 've never received this magazine , but we just received the bill with a message that we are about to be turned over to a collection agency . beware of this compan
1	love this magazine ! just wish it came out more often . great for more than those with farms or homesteads . articles on gardening , building projects , animals . buy it
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time . if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator , readsomething else
1	i subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and southern accents is the best , bar none . the houses featured are absolutely dreamy -- the photography is gorgeous -- and while the magazine does n't offer how-to decorating ideas , there is so much inspiration . i find it to be intelligently written ... which is rare in a decorating magazine . the articles on antiques are particularly informative . this magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful , classic design -- whether or not you live in the south
1	from cover to cover this magazine is artistically designed and inspired . everything you expect it to be , it is . not only do the articles and pictures portray the latest and greatest in fashion and pop culture , but even the ads lead you to the high-end fashionably eclectic such as oakley eyewear and screaming mimi 's . the articles are varied , going from mandy moore 's new style to the new l.a. african dance trend known as `` krumping '' ( ferocious , free , and performed at breakneck speed ) , to architectural design so out-of-the-way that it includes a cardboard box house . if you love fashion , the odd , the sensual , the just plain cool , then subscribe to paper . i 'd buy it for $ 20
0	this magazine should be free , since there are so many advertisements . also , it is strictly modern decorating , unlike the editor 's claims . if you like extreme , modern style , try it out ; otherwise invest in something else
0	this magazine just dares people to pick the most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . `` town country '' is an extremely old money venture , and while it does have some good and useful articles ( and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford , ) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly . `` town country '' was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture , two areas i have great interest in . as an applicable aside , when i read a list of tips in the offshoot `` town country travel '' publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights , i realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class , ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to europe or asia costs . as i mentioned , there are some good articles , and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like `` town country travel '' that are eminently more readable ( although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast , etc . ) i will say that the photography is always good , and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like to be seen reading this magazine . despite having occasionally worthwhile features , i find `` town country '' to be excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have , whether it is fashion , society , or travel .
1	sometimes the national enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject - for example it broke the story about o . j . 's shoes . i guess you have to pick and choose your articles . some of the articles , i admit , are useless . however , other articles are interesting and some you ca n't find anyplace else
0	i purchased this magazine solely to get cheaper access to espn insider online . the magazine is so all over the place otherwise that its hardly worth reading . its chock full of tidbits that barely gloss over sports topics . i keep it in my bathroom and i guess its good there when i only have a few minutes to read while brushing my teeth or whatnot . do n't expect si-type depth though , its full of ads and slick factoid type departments . reading this magazine is like watching sportscenter , a lot of many little things with no depth on anything . i guess its worth it for less than 60 cents an issue , but if i sat down to read this magazine cover to cover i would be done with it totally in under 15 minutes ... .enjoy
0	i subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in pdf form . i was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them . frankly i was disappointed . the reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis , ( the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book ) . reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review ... please . they are also fairly out of date . most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while . some titles are n't available anywhere that i can figure . whats the point in reviewing an audio title you ca n't find ? my interest is primariy sci-fi , horror and romantic-horror . most of the titles audiofile reviews are fiction . the articles are n't particularly interesting . frankly i could care less what the narrator thinks or feels , as long as they have a good voice . there is also a sort of ... literay snob tone to audiofile . i get the feeling they like certain authors and certain titles and tend to overly focus on them . i 'd really like to see audiofile have a 'coming soon ' review column . it would be very useful to know what titles will be coming out in the future . i 'd also like to see more romance , dark fantasy , and horror reviews , or at least make the section focusing on different genres a little more clear . i also think the sections focussing on children 's titles and self-help are a little large . 2 stars . if you must subscribe , get the online version . that way you can cancel anytime , and do n't have to worry about subscription problems
1	this is a pretty good magazine . the niche is that it goes out every week and thus it is the most current business news magazine out there ( if you compare it to fortune , forbes ... ) . i always find 3-4 interesting articles there , but do n't expect to read cover to cover
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
0	i paid i never received magazine at all even though i received all four of the other magazines that were ordered at the same time
1	good housekeeping is a wholesome , clean , serious magazine . various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children , household tips , financial help , or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman . i 'm married and only in my 20s , but i still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway . i absolutely love this magazine ! i was looking for a magazine with good , long articles to read , and i found this great one . they even re-designed the look , and it 's excellent . everything is more organized , clearly separated into their respective sections , and each page is clearly marked with the section header so i 'll always know which section i 'm on . i particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies , talk to me by joy behar about relationship advice , and peggy post 's etiquette dilemmas
1	if you are looking for the quality of an apa journal , this is not one . but if you love the field of psychology as i do , it 's a fun and relevant periodical . kind of a enquirer of psychology . i find it a fun read when i 'm relaxing , but be careful of their interpretation of research . you know how that can go . it 's also got a flavor of maxim or cosmo type topics . sex , relationships , dating , what do men/women like as well as diet/nutrition . overall recommended
0	knitters take note : i purchased what was titled as `` anna : burda knitting needlecrafts-english ed '' . what arrived was `` anna needlework and crafts , '' which contains very little knitting . i should have looked at the photo of the magazine cover in the ad , which displays the needlework crafts cover . since i ca n't find the magazine conveniently in my north mississippi area i 'll shell out another 50 bucks and order from the publisher , i guess .
1	before i begin , there 's one thing you need to know : i ca n't cook . i have skills that ca n't be beaten when it comes to heating stuff in the microwave , and i can use the toaster oven to , uh , toast things , but that 's it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals for me , which probably makes me the only person who ca n't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say a great deal about just how entertaining every day with rachael ray actually is . of course , as you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would be weird for someone to buy this magazine if they did n't cook and they also hated rachael , and i 'm not that weird ! however , although this is ostensibly a cooking-centric magazine , i 'd argue that it really reflects rachael 's attitude and personality . her enthusiasm , love of a wide variety of food , and adventurous spirit shine through on every page . by all reports , rachael was very hands-on in developing this magazine , and it shows . to those who ask why they need to read a rachael ray magazine , since rachael is all over television these days ( most recently with her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew on this : rachael is n't taking over the world by accident . she 's obviously doing something right to be dominating both the food network 's daily schedule and the bestseller lists ( for her ever-increasing line of cookbooks ) . people just ca n't get their fill of her ! so , what exactly is her secret ? i think it boils down to these factors : a combination of approachability and charisma , which are key ingredients of superstardom ( think of talented-yet-friendly stars such as tom hanks or shakira ) . add to that a dash of optimism mixed with a spirit of adventure , as witnessed on my favorite ray show , `` $ 40 a day , '' in which she explores a new tourist destination each week , trying to eat well on an insanely low budget . but what about rachael ray in magazine form , you 're wondering ? well , in my opinion , every day with rachael ray appeals to all tastes by brilliantly translating her unique appeal from the tv screen to the printed page . as i mentioned earlier , i probably wo n't be cooking anything from the many recipes included in each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes a picture of the finished product , and the recipes have lots of variety and creativity ... yum-o ! and some are so simple , like sandwiches or salads , that i get the feeling i might actually be able to attempt them if i really wanted to ( see ? rachael 's `` can-do '' attitude even gets through to the kitchen-incompetent ! ) the travel articles and the short pieces ( about a wide range of topics such as buying cheese , making mistakes in the kitchen , etc . ) are also fun . but , as a rachael fan , i especially enjoy the parts of the magazine written by , or about , rachael . one nice feature is a q a in which readers can send in questions about rachael which she personally answers . as someone who has participated in a lot of `` celebrity q a 's '' online in the past , i love these chances to get to know more about someone famous who you may never meet in person . in fact , the only reason i have n't rated every day with rachael ray `` five stars '' is because i 'd like to see even more rachael-related photos and articles in each issue ... how cool would that be ? ! also , i 'm hungry for more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but to be fair , this is a relatively new magazine , and all great magazines need time to sort out what does and does n't work . and so far , every day with rachael ray has hit the ground running and is off to a great start . i was actually the first person to buy the very first issue at my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky and happened to be there as they set up the display ) , and i 've looked forward to each new issue ever since that day . if you like rachael ray , you ca n't go wrong here ... start spending every day with rachael ray and `` take a bite outta life . '' even if you ca n't boil water !
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive , but it 's mostly advertising . very disappointing . it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it ( which is why it got 2 stars from me ) , but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription
0	oh those were the days , when i was in college , reading my first issues and then subscribing . there were great things to be found in its pages , columns by brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . the great struggle with the soviet union was going into a critical stage . it seemed nr was so on the right track . and it was wonderful to read , at least from about 1979 to 1983 . but then it became for a while duller . it had some periods of recrudescence , such as under the editorship of john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began to dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i 've really discovered of late is how badly the neo-con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine . we 've got in the 50th anniversary issue a call by midge dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in iraq . really something has happened to the magazine , a sinister force has entrenched itself there . what is that force ? well , go to come-and-hear.com and you will begin to learn part of the picture , especially when you read the material by elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley 's they dare to speak out , which details the israeli lobby 's domination of our congress . nr was once a courageous conservative magazine , but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing . wfb should know better , and maybe he does . if he does n't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! and neo-conned again ! , and then he should listen to tony martin 's talk given to the ihr on a certain group 's tactics deployed to suppress free speech . what has inspired me to write this review is wfb 's recent column on the incarceration of david irving . it ends in a disgusting gloating . wfb has fallen into an evil trap , and so has the magazine he used to run . what has happened to the christian faith of people like buckley ? he now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group ... and you , mr. lowry , come on now : read widely and deeply and do n't be afraid of reading the talmud and about the israeli lobby . once you do , maybe you 'll develop the strength to think outside the box . we 're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet .
0	i would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine is n't worthy of its title . i subscribed before reading review , i was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read , though some stories are interesting i 'm sure i 'd be able to find them in other magazines like vogue or cosmo . and there is plenty of ads , probably more than stories . and much like other reviewers when i first ordered it , it took forever for the first issue to arrive , now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course
1	great magazine . they got good tips on everything . eating/building muscle/sheddin excess fat/ all that . recommend this mag to body builders . i get it every month . good stuff
0	this magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year , meaning most reviews prior to april 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine . i was a subscriber since the early 90 's and have recently cancelled . this magazine had a mid ( end of life ? ) crisis and now wants to cover just about anything that uses electricity . and cars ! why would i pick up pc magazine to read a car review ? their `` improved '' layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows and `` cool '' sayings to replace actual review content . what is their market here ? 12 year old geeks with an extra $ 80k laying around to drop on an suv ? get real . until this magazine makes another radical change in direction to get back on topic , it is best avoided
1	magazine was fast to ship , with all of the timeless great advice you would expect from gq
1	bridal guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon . this magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable . besides the fashion , one can read about wedding planning , honeymoon ideas , photography , and other wedding- related things . when you read a copy of bridal guide , what stands out more than anything are the photos . this is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place : to look at wedding attire and compare different styles . models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning . to help future brides make a possible purchase , it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos . bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine , but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members , with models displaying other fashions for sale , once again complete with phone number and web page . the part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue . what i like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone , regardless of marital status . these honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine . bridal guide is a very lengthy publication , with each issue containing around 500 pages ! this is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times . also , this magazine is saturated with ads . since the majority of the gown- clad models are , in effect , advertisements for a specific fashion brand , one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine 's pages . this could be annoying to some , but one must bear in mind that the magazine 's focus is wedding planning , so excessive advertising is expected . for young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes , this is a handy magazine to have around . it 's very long , but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever .
0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer . they might as well call this the robb report . they only test highend cars and the `` best '' ones are the ones that go 0-60mph the quickest , not ride nice or get good mpg
0	full of ads , hardly any content at all . not worth paying for it .
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america , and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in europe . there are very few articles or artist bios . the photos are beautiful , but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries
0	i have received this magazine from it 's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies , however , the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service . i have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right . i have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer . if you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue
0	even if you 're a `` conservative , '' you got ta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around . if you like good writing , do n't even try this one . a `` one star '' is still too generous in my opinion .
0	i subscribed to forbes magazine for a year or two , and in general the content is good , but i cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons . ( a ) 33 % of the pages are all advertisements - what a waste of space , ( b ) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as i read the magazine , and ( b ) the classifieds in the back are `` not of interest '' to any real business person . if you do n't mind the ads and the fluff , then this magazine might be right for you ! it 's not for me . i give it 2 stars
1	people is a great magazine ! it has all the gossip without the drama of some of the other magazines . i got my first issue faster than expected ! i ordered sept. 22nd and have been reading for 3 or 4 weeks already ! : ) if you are looking for a weekly mag - this is the one to pick !
1	i 've been a subscriber to outside magazine for several years , and it seems to go through its ups and downs in terms of the strength of its editorial content , especially regarding the political side of environmentalism . it is still easily the most informative magazine out there for lovers of the outdoors , but just note that the focus is on active , not armchair , appreciation of nature . beyond the occasionally great and always heavily knowledgeable product reviews , the key strength of this magazine is the well-written and strongly researched articles on outdoor issues of concern , not just in america but around the world . an outstanding recent example , among many , concerns the economics of environmentalism in the conservative western u.s . this is the type of strong conservationist reporting that can usually only be found otherwise in books . other more whimsical articles are just fun to read for those with off-kilter interests , such as recent pieces on urban rock climbing or sauna fanatics in finland . many other articles could be classified more as travel/tourism than adventure , but the accompanying photography is always top-notch , and the editors have a knack for finding out-of-the-way hidden treasures around the world that are ripe for discovery by the adventurous . ( but on the other hand , the magazine could be faulted for contributing to the recent trend of hyping previously unknown outdoor paradises that have since become crowded , such as molly sods wilderness in west virginia . ) personally , i would like to see a little less focus on expensive vacations that extreme sports fanatics can take in hard-to-reach nations , and more on what folks with more realistic means ( and amounts of free time ) can do in humble parks and forests near home . but despite its habit of losing its focus at times , i will continue to be a fan of outside for years to come , and might just travel to some of those hyped exotic adventure locations .

1	intelligently written , beautifully illustrated and designed , this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans . it should be of interest also to non-collectors or accidental collectors who just happen to love books . great features on authors and genres will interest many ; succinct departments will help novice and experienced bibliophiles
0	after ordering this magazine it sems that i 've got a gardening membership , which was okay i guess , but now i 've got some book sitting in my office that i can preview for 10 days and decide to keep for the low low cost of only ... .. you get the picture . all i wanted was a gardening magazine . if i wanted to join a book club or a gardening club than i would have . i really feel like i was decieved by the discription of this magazine and now i get the joyful fun of returning items i do n't want or getting charged for them . yeah !
0	this magazine seems most interested in promoting books , etc . that it has a financial interest in -- most notably lately the south beach diet . prevention and it 's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads . too bad , because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition , weight loss , exercise and natural remedies that is n't influenced by it 's publishing partners and advertisers . skip this one , and try self or health for a more well-rounded look at women 's heath needs
1	good tips to read about when you do not have time to get out on the course
0	i 've subscripted to gourmet for years but i let my subscription run out . the lifestyle articles keep pushing out the recipies . as i read through food magazines i dog-ear the page with a recipe i want to try . in the last year there were very few dog-eared pages and it was n't worth continuing the subscription
0	i have been subscribing to us weekly for about a year and a half . in that time , i have never seen an issue without several pages of jessica simpson . i have to wonder ; does jessica donate money to this magazine ? she seems to dominate the whole magazine , each and every week . i wo n't be renewing my subscription . i 'm tired of jessica and the untruths that us weekly supplies

1	i 'm a culinary historian and author ( california pioneers , their stories , culture and cuisine ) who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history , especially food history . when i want to give my burned-out peepers a break , i reach for this magazine . as much as i love the food articles -- mostly because , as great as they look , realistically they are quite do-able for just about anyone -- what i really find useful is the `` ask martha '' column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about . and then there are the craft projects ... i have tried several and was surprised by my success . i credit this to the well laid-out photos and very clear instructions . my advice is , if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well-designed ( and i do not mean `` haughty '' ) lifetsyle , then you can not go wrong with martha stewart living . also , the special holiday ideas are the best ever ... makes one wonder , how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do-able for the general population ?

0	i was a subscriber to the new republic for several years , but in the waning years of the clinton administration and the beginnings of the bush ii administration , the paper seemed to take a real rightward turn . now , i have no problem with so-called liberal hawks , but the magazine 's slavish support for the war in iraq in the face of questionable evidence did it for me . in addition , the magazine spends more time bashing democrats for not aligning themselves with the magazine 's professed centrist/liberal slant than it does with presenting true progressives ideals that create thoughtful discourse among its readers . the magazine has forgotten its roots of progressive intellectualism and dissent in favor of safe , `` new democrat '' rhetoric . there are better magazines our there
0	i used to buy this off the shelf each month , but last november , my wife bought me a subscription . i bought the december issue , ... cause it had n't arrived by mail yet . no problem . in january , i received the november issue . a few weeks later , in early february , i received the december issue , but not the january , so i went out and bought the january . by the end of february , still had n't received the feb yet , so bought it . then , received the january issue and a few weeks later the february . i was fed up . i know they were getting 'caught up ' , but not only was i getting editions that i 'd already bought off the shelf , but i figured these were counting against my 12 issues . i cancelled . they deducted a few bucks from my refund for `` issues received '' and had no apologies for the mess . i like the magazine , but i will say that if you read it over time , it become redundant . the suggested work-outs are mostly rehashes of past work-out routines . lets face it ... there are only so many ways to work out and when you get right down to it , you got ta hit it hard and often , change things up , etc ... bla bla bla ... the best part of the magazine are the few pages they dedicate to the correct way to execute a lift or detail what muscles are hit . lots of weider ads ... but then its a weider publication , so what can you expect ... i 'd buy it off the shelf because you 'll eventually get tired of the same old thing ... and their subscription program is iffy . -

0	this mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an os setting . shallow coverage , and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across . it is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet . there is nothing original in this mag , ever . also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier . all the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months . do n't believe me ? take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them . the reviews are also weak . nearly every month you will see : the fastest system we ever tested ! ! ! ! ! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute , even for gamers . besides , does it really matter that system y is .00005 % faster on their poor testing system then computer z ? the second star is for mr halfhills column . it is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how . read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want , learn how to use search engines , and skip this pointless mag
1	let 's face it ... ... . owning a mac is like owning a harley or an airstream . it 's a cult ! ! ! good fun . harmless as can be and it just makes you feel good everytime you sit down at your mac . having a magazine come every month with a bunch of foolishness about this very slick machine increases the joy way more than the magazine price . i read it from cover to cover and even believe some of it
0	cook 's illustrated is the first cooking magazine that i 'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover , even though they do insert advertisements for their own products , which i suppose , to them , makes this an `` ad-free '' magazine , but i 'm not surprised they 've bent the rules with that claim . the one time i found it necessary to contact cook 's illustrated about a customer service issue , i was simply floored by the treatment that i received ... i 'll simply leave it at that . i personally do n't intend on re-subscribing ( `` fine cooking '' , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find that this is the cooking magazine for you . and , as far as what they do goes , cook 's illustrated is good at what they do - i 'll give them that . if you have not found this review to be helpful , i 'm sorry if i have n't made the value in my warning apparent . just know that there are those of us out there who have had bad experiences , and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same .
1	a good start to create your own business
1	nyrb features long , in-depth articles about recent books and events . the `` reviews '' frequently take the book under discussion as a starting point for a wide-ranging essay which then becomes a work in its own right . indeed , i 've seen articles in nyrb referred to in academic papers . do n't fear that nyrb will bore you , however . i 've often found a nyrb article to be a great introduction to an area of thought or literature previously unknown to me . the only negative is a rather tedious michael-mooreish political stance . i have no objection to seeing bush bashed , but wish that nyrb could do so in a more creative and less repetitive manner . maybe once in a while we could hear from someone who actually likes the man ? nevertheless i find nyrb an indispensable periodical . i find it a great complement to the economist , which features a more pro-business and pro-free trade economic stance and wider , but less deep , coverage of the world
0	i can not review something that i have not received . i thought i would have received my first issue by now but have not . if and when i receive the magazien i order i will be happy to review
1	i used to read the online content for this magazine ( i still check out the blog ) , but i have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online , and it 's really worth subscribing . the articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues i may not have realized i had a mind to change on . i would recommend this magazine to anyone
1	entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles.i consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information i receive for about a buck . there are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with , but that seems to be the case with most media . i do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business . it is a good complement however
1	i frequently read 'new criterion ' articles on the 'arts and letters daily ' website . they are usually of high- quality and well- worth reading . hilton kramer and roger kimball the editorial writers , mark steyn the drama critic ( and also one of the best writers on world- affairs around ) jay nordlinger ( the music critic ) are among the regulars in a solid and respectable cast of writers . the great joseph epstein also writes here . the articles in 'the new criterion ' give the sense that there is a living 'high culture ' , and this in spite of the often critical stance to many modern cultural developments .
0	kissinger , honorary chairman of the national interest , was going to head-up the 9/11 whitewash commission , but he begged off when families objected . dov zakheim , the 2.3 trillion dollar missing and unaccounted for pentagon funds man , is on the journal 's board . one is better off reading commentary magazine , where at least the `` neocon fascist madmen '' ( in web tarpley 's phrase ) state their case in clearer and more honest - if that 's the word - prose . i remember reading one article in the national interest which actually made the assertion that we , meaning the usa , will need to engage in terrorism on occassion . i could n't believe they would actually print something like that , but they did . this fundamentally dishonest journal is a waste of time , for the most part , because it is neither interesting ( the statement described in the above paragraph notwithstanding ) nor meant , in the main , really other than to fool the public . kissinger i have a strong suspicion knows what happened on 9/11 and so do i suspect does zakheim ( to put it mildly in the latter 's case ) , and yet they pretend the official version is true . supporting this journal is supporting the bad guys
0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
1	the good -- -- -- -- * this is a nice magazine for the price . * it has some informative articles , which maybe useful to newcomers to photography in general or the digital aspects of photography . * if you are getting started in photography , or you are at a beginner/amateur level , this magazine can be very helpful as a stepping stone * if you are an experienced amateur/pro , you can still like this magazine , but do n't expect many in-depth/advanced topics . * the monthly lens reviews are helpful to slr/dslr users * for people who like to flip through magazines and even look at ads from different vendors , this is a good resource . the not so good -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - * the technical reviews of digital cameras are skin-deep compared to the in-depth technical reviews by the online photography sites ( such as dpreview ) . * sometimes the reviews are word-smithed in such a way that they avoid saying negative things , so -at times- you have to pick-up on what is not said in the review in order to figure out if there 's something wrong with a product . * the `` news '' are 4-12 weeks behind real time . * if you expect in-depth or pro-level articles , those are rare . consumer beware segment -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - towards the back of the magazine there are plenty of ads from various mail-order vendors . some of them are very reputable , honorable and reliable vendors such as b and j however , some other vendors are less than stellar - to put it in mildly . you will recognize them by the too-good-to-be-true super-low prices , and they usually practice `` bait switch '' among other things . these have been documented on various websites and photography forums . if you are not familiar with all these , and you see prices that are very low , you may want to do some research before purchasing
1	aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine , and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout . although ostensively devoted to art photography , many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism . if you are primarily interested in just art photography , and can subscribe only to one magazine , i would suggest `` blind spot ''
0	i have yet to receive my first issue of cat fancy ... ... .who do i contact to correct this problem ? ?
1	i believe that this magazine is a must have for any designer . especially those that are new to the field . i am a student and i read this magazine from cover to cover and feel that it covers all aspects of the business well . it is written so that even the beginner can understand all of the aspects and use the ideas in their everyday work/projects . i think that this magazine is one of the best references for graphic design on the market that i have found
1	today i received the first issue - april 2006 issue . i found it amazing and informative resource for body , mind and soul practices toward healthier life.. the most thing i liked about this magazine is that it respects religions . it provides accurate information from various religions to help people of other believes improve their lives . ( relying to what i read until now in this issue
1	great magazine . but do n't subscribe here . you can do it online at her website or tear out the order form in a magazine and it will cost 50 % less
0	where macworld is bad , addict is dreadful . it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat , and the `` reviews '' do n't deserve the name . the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing , leaving no pretence of independence . like its competitor , it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry , so we get articles about the `` secrets '' of such and such product . a `` secret '' in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer . this should be blasted , not applauded . but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product
1	my 4ish daughter loves this magazine , as do we . each issue gets pretty tattered while she waits for the next issue . educational ( for all of us ) and entertaining . she remembers the information given to her in the short and concise articles and enjoys testing us to see if we were paying attention . a keeper for sure
0	i 've been receiving this magazine for almost 4 years now . it has n't changed much since i started receiving it ... and i pretty much still think of it as the worst teen magazine that 's still in business . i 'm 16 now and have n't liked it anymore as i 've gotten older . the strangest part about this magazine to me is the fact that they just keep sending it to me ! i mean , i barely even remember when i was first subscribed to it ( it was some kind of deal where you can get certain magazines for like 6 months or something , and i did n't have many choices so i picked this one ) . eventually the other magazines stopped coming . but this one continued to come . and still does ! i would have thought it might be nice if a company made an accidental error or something and continued to send me a magazine . i would have been thrilled if that happened with any other magazine ( i actually do n't mind seventeen , allure , cosmogirl , teenpeople occasionally , or even teen magazine. ) . but this one just makes me wonder if these people are downright stupid ... the least they could have done is `` accidentally '' send it to someone who likes their magazine ! if that person exists ? i think i read a fairly broad variety of teen magazines these days , so i 'll try to discuss my dislikes about it in relation to those . so this is a comparison of this one versus : seventeen , cosmogirl , ellegirl ( i suspect it recently went out of print however ) , teen magazine , teen people magazine , allure , cosmopolitan , and jane magazines . 1 . overall value conclusion : teen vogue= very low value and overpriced . smaller size first off , one of the easiest things to see about this magazine when its on the shelf is the fact that it 's smaller then the others . all of my magazines are about the same size . except for this one ; which is maybe as much as 2 inches shorter in height and 1 inch smaller in width . i do n't know why the magazine makers decided to do this . in my opinion , it only draws more attention to the fact that while it is around the same price as the other magazines ... they had to cut out at least something to make it smaller . sounds like a rip off to me . ( ... but i 'm getting it for free for some reason , so i guess that 's hardly my biggest concern . it may be yours though ) . cost compared to content magazine prices can be a little missleading at first glance . it 's easy to find a thicker magazine and assume that more pages = better value ? but that 's not the case . the abundance of ads in a magazine can lead you to that conclusion , but there 's a good chance you 'll be disappointed when there are hardly any articles in between ad after ad after ad . by the way ... for those of you who are n't familiar with teen magazines these days , i hope you realize : they all have ads this is the truth , but i do n't see it as a terrible thing personally . when i was 11 and i first found an issue of teen magazine at the library , i was shocked at the ad content . but i used to read american girl magazine ( which had no ads ) so i thought it was so bizarre . now i do n't mind it . i even save some of the ads because i like photography and looking at different angles of things . i do n't think it 's fair however , to hate teen vogue solely because of the ads though , as all the magazines are going to have ads . the amount of ad content in each one is the main thing that varies ; so here 's my interpretation ... seventeen , cosmogirl - limited ad content ( they have more ads towards the beginning , and then they 're much more spread out . seventeen is probably my favorite magazine of the bunch and they manage to get by with one ad opposite of an article for a few pages and then a stop the ads for a few pages or so before they do it again . i find it highly tolerable ) teen magazine - even less ad content . ( i think they 've really decreased the amount of ads over the years actually . they probably have the least ads of all my magazines ) teen people , ellegirl , jane - more than seventeen and cosmogirl but not terrible . allure and cosmopolitan = high ad content . ( i almost put them seperately , but they are similar . they have a lot of ads i think , but for the most part , i do n't mind . they manage to balance most of it out with enough articles and pictures to make buying the magazine worth while . the main difference i see is just in the choice of ads . cosmopolitan puts in so many ads for sex related things and has many more vulgar ads . allure i like more anyway . and i guess cosmopolitan as a magazine focuses a whole lot more on sex already , so many teen moms may not appreciate their daughter reading it in the first place . ) teen vogue = high ad content i 'd say the ad content was very similar to the ad content in cosmopolitan and allure . however , the thing that pisses me off , is the fact that there is n't enough content to balance it out ! ( maybe i mean `` meaningful content '' but more on that later ... ) . the saddest part about this magazine is that i save more of the ads then i ever save articles . the ads really are more exciting then the content unfortunately ... 2 . articles conclusion teen vogue = fluff filled , unimportant to me now , generally , i consider seventeen to have the best articles ( with cosmogirl in a close second ) along with maybe allure although it 's addressed to an older crowd . reasons why i actually take the time to read the seventeen articles , although i hardly even bother with the teen vogue ones : a. seventeen writes about something that actually interests me ( ok , ok , so occasionally they have a little stinker . but overall , i think they do a good job . ) teen vogue ... does not . i 'm interested by things i have n't thought of before , or personal accounts of things that i would be unsure how to react to , issues that seem to happen everywhere but with stunning new facts enclosed and statistics to give me a perspective ... etc . i could go on . but unfortunately , i do n't think teen vogue has managed to intrigue me . ever . a typical teen vogue article is something like `` the truth about crystal meth '' , `` i was being bullied online ! `` , blah blah . i can hardly even think of anything i 've ever been interested by . they have a tendency to focus on things that i already know are bad , things like drugs especially . it makes me feel like i 'm being babied ... like `` hey , well i bet you did n't know this ... . if you do this your liver could turn black and blue and all the colors of the rainbow '' and then pile a bunch of tear jerking stories of teens who had `` no idea '' of the dangers of _____ drug and then something terrible happened . i mean i think it 's important that teens see the dangers in doing such things ... i just get annoyed rather than enlightened when it seems like such an easy and obvious thing . particularly when they make a big deal about it being so `` unknown '' and mysterious like nobody has ever heard of it before , when i know that most of the people i talk to every day do anyway . if i do n't take the freaking drug ... i wo n't have to worry about all the problems associated with it , and sometimes it 's hard for me to be sympathetic to these girls who screw their lives up ( especially when in the article , they make themselves seem like complete idiots ! ) . i 'm not anti drug articles though either . when seventeen did one a while back , for example , it was an article ( or maybe more of a chart ? ) of `` drugs that make you ugly '' . now that i found enlightening and very interesting . it did n't focus on one drug , but instead on one effect that many different drugs cause . not only do i want to use the drugs less , i also feel like i 'm more able to recognize the signs of its use , so i could identify the signs . it 's important to me that magazine editors take the time to teach us something new , without beating us over again with the same stuff we hear everywhere else . teen vogue just has n't figured that out yet . b. i find the good advice in seventeen meaningful . teen vogue ... makes me wonder if i should be the one giving them good advice ... i think i was most disappointed with teen vogue on this when they did an article that caught my eye about girls who are addicted to tanning . they spent nearly 2 whole pages rambling about different girls and their tanning habits ( and general stupidity ... ) . and barely even gave the reason why it 's not a good idea . i remember reading one of the last sentences in my head over and over again . it was like `` remember to live your life and have fun , but try to be safe '' . i mean wtf ? ? ! you could be talking about anything with that . cooking , driving , sex ... it 's so generic that it 's stupid . the only thing that i got from that article was a justification that there really are a lot of stupid girls who are damaging their skin to be tan , and have no idea about it . unfortunately , if these girls read teen vogue , they will probably never know either . 3 . features conclusion teen vogue = ... are you serious ? um . i ca n't find a better word than worthless to describe this magazine 's features . i used to like the `` a room of my own '' thing that they had at the back of my issue . it was nice to be inspired by the way that other girls kept their rooms based on what they liked . but in the last year ... i think they managed to totally kill that part too . the uniquenesses and interesting things that once intrigued me a little have been replaced by more mediocre rooms by other girls ( lately they 've been somehow connected to a famous person . yeah , how exciting ... not ) that just do n't inspire me at all . oh , and one of the second to last pages or so , there 's a feature where they find some girl with `` style '' and tell her to describe it and what brands she likes ... blah blah . occasionally ( well , no , rarely ) , there will be something that i actually find interesting and want to save to remember . but most of the time it 's just a bunch of 13 year olds trying to be trendy by throwing on the coolest things they know ... all at the same time . no thank you . in most other magazines , i can appreciate a monthly space for something about hair , or makeup , or something related to beauty that i could find useful . teen vogue does not do this . but then again , everytime that i have seen them slip something along those lines in , they manage to make me question their intelligence . ( `` omigod , mom ! teen vogue says i should put glittery pink eyeshadow up to my eyebrows so i can be cool . we have to go spend $ 67 now so that we can have the exact product that they used ! '' eek . ) the makeup is useful ... if you want to be a stage artist perhaps ? i do n't know ... i 'm still working on that one . 4 . the fashion focus conclusion teen vogue = fashion help for the extremely wealthy and confused if you disregard the fact that virtually everything in the magazine is rediculously overpriced and just unpractical ... i suppose someone might find their fashion sense useful/inspirational somehow . but i 'm afraid i do not . i remember skimming through one article that answered a question asking `` how do i avoid looking like a tourist on vacation ? '' to which they answered with showing how you can pile on a bunch of random clothing pieces and come off as an idiot instead . how exciting ... they also have a tendency to encourage readers to buy things by showing us models wearing such clothing . i would n't be surprised if the plus-size community completely gave up on them , in fact i 'm surprised that there is no outrage over this . look teen vogue , i know gemma ward looks excellent in that ( ok , i 'm lying ... but i can pretend , right ? ) . but you see , me and gemma , we have some differences . for example ... her thighs are probably less then half the size of mine , she 's like half a foot taller then me , she weighs maybe half of what i do , and ... well ... she 's a model that seems to look good in everything . i do not . and i refuse to let you convince me that such a hideous outfit wo n't look hideous on anyone else . actually , i wonder if gemma ward could afford the things in their magazine . she 's a super model afterall . but maybe after spending $ 150 on each pair of underwear ... things begin to add up , even for her . darn ... the bottom line : do n't waste your money on this magazine ( in fact , do n't even get it accidentally for free like me , it 's not worth your time ) . if you want to buy a teen girl a magazine subscription , try something like seventeen , cosmogirl , teen people etc . just about anything is better than this .
0	this magazine is published by the same people that brought us maxim . so if you like maxim , check it out . if you do n't : pass . the pictures are slick , models are attractive , but there is little in the way of information on how to do it yourself or what was actually done to the bike . it is basically a picture book . if you are looking for technical articles , how tos or performance installs ; check out road bike for metrics or hot bike or american iron for harleys and victory 's
1	i have been knitting for 25 years and have a huge stash of mags , books and yarn . these mags are always at the top of the pile . beautiful photos , easy directions and patterns you will find no where else . my favorite to date is the stuffed hedgehog in his bathrobe ( you have got to see it ! ) and the knitted nativity scene . tell me where else could you get that !
1	i love paper . i always buy it , along with the village voice to find out what to do where to go in the city . i find it perfect for daytripping . it 's got fun fashion too ! ( i 'm a professional artist book lover . and former new yorker .
1	just got this in the mail : if i allow si to charge my credit card now for a subscription that is n't due to renew until 12/24/2007 , they will send me 60 issues for $ 39.00 , or .65 per issue . i have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time . so there is a very slight savings , somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my $ $ $ for an extra 9 months or so ( recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2 % , that interest is worth about 50 cents , so i guess it pushes the per issue rate up to .66 )
0	[ ... ] i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine . since i already got parents , i chose child . i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up . the magazine is boring , the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages . if you want a magazine about parenting/kids , go with parents .
0	having regularly read `` bicycling '' for many years ( even when it was called `` bicycling ! '' in a tasteless 1970s way ) , i find it surprising to see how much the quality of the magazine has declined . in spite of all those people spending huge amounts of money on fancy equipment , `` bicycling '' has become thinner and thinner . it has recently improved somewhat , after most of the editorial staff was fired , and a sign is the dropping of the truly horrible marginal comments ( bike love and so forth ) but it is only suitable for real neophytes . unfortunately , there is no other single magazine that covers racing , bike touring , test reviews , technique and fitness in north america , no matter how poorly . the articles are very short and sometimes , well , just stupid . there is very little on cycling destinations or serious equipment tests . the photography remains decent , but compared to the german magazine `` tour , '' for example , `` bicycling '' is a pretty sad effort . if you can read this , you have access to the internet , which means you have far better sources of information to draw on . i am letting my subscription lapse and advise you to save your money . a big disappointment , `` bicycling '' has not advanced with its readers
0	oh lord ! ! does anyone still read this ? ? i was a subscriber back in the early 70 's , when it was a folded up , newspaper.by and large , jann wenner let people run it , that knew how to . it is now , and has been nothing more than an ad choked , gossiping teen slick.right , like they are the ones with the money ! ! i wonder what they still pay raoul duke , to do ? ? ! ! ralph gleason has to be turning over in the grave
1	yes - there are tons of great shots in the mag ; great articles ( in french only ) , contests -- -very chic ... .however -- -- customer service will treat you like the redheaded stepchild when you ask them `` why have you not sent me the latest issue of photo ? ? `` ... .and you know it will happen . they only send you sporadic issues when they feel like it ( or so it would seem ) ... most issues are available on the stand weeks before you get yours delivered via mail ( should it be the other way around ? ? ? ) and they wont give you a courtesy letter/postcard telling you when your subscription is up ... that 's for you to figure out . so if you can deal with the lame french hold music when you call photo 's cutomers service constantly , this is a great magazine ... .. cough ... cough ... vive la france !
1	of the big 3 ( fortune , forbes , and businessweek ) , i like fortune the most . businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing . forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose -- -to report and analyze the business world . fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does
1	the week is a great magazine for anyone who is interested in current events but does n't always have time to consume a lot of media . the snippets of world news are interesting and useful , the more in-depth excerpts tend to be on unusual and interesting topics , and the fun fillers ( comics et al . ) make it a fun , quick read . we really enjoy it from cover to cover . nothing boring to skip
0	i also bought this magazine sight-unseen and i wish i had n't . for re-decorating purposes , i found this magazine to be not useful at all . the homes and gardens are pretty , but what they feature ( furniture , wall and window coverings ) just would not go with the middle-class home ... way too opulent . i was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores ... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from xyz antique store in new york . also , i found this magazine text-heavy . all in all , an ok magazine for a professional decorater maybe , but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate
1	i have been a smart money subscriber for over three years . i must say that each month i look forward to receiving the new issue . it needs to be said ( to those who are n't aware ) that this is a publication of the wall street journal . there is n't as much market news but the writing is just as good . from undervalued stock picks , to mutual fund screening and research , finding cheap bottles of good wine , car ratings , retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years . i find the writing to be accurate and insightful . i would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $ 3 per issue . that 's the true value i find in it . hands down it 's the best personal finance magazine around . head and shoulders above money kiplingers
1	this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it . rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines , sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive . the articles are interesting and well written . the authors are n't afraid to point out a car 's flaws , and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced . most importantly , this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast . the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive , not stuff like cupholders . if you 're into fun cars , both new and old , this really is a must-have magazine .
0	this magazine is a waste of money and bores me . nothing here to see but ads
0	i would like to classify myself as a moderate but i probably lean conservative . because of that , i subscribed to harpers so that i could read good writing that would challenge my beliefs and stretch my mind in new ways . i got that , more or less , at first , but over the course of a couple of years the magazine drifted further and further to a leftist propaganda screed , the worst of which was louis lapham 's bitter drivel editorials . it got to a point where the writing was incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left of pelosi ) the writer -- any writer in harpers -- would take on whatever the issue was , and i had a pretty good idea of what the line of whining would be . if you attend dinner parties on the upper east side ; if you drive a prius to the oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming is an environmental travesty ; if you 've ever desecrated a starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine is for you . however , if you 're dumbfounded at how the republicans can keep winning elections -- and then you realize they have the democratic party as opponents ; if you realize the genius of george bush and karl rove is in getting liberals to underestimate george bush and karl rove ; if you want to read smart , insightful writing that will inform and entertain , then try the atlantic monthly ( which , by the way , i am surprised to see reviewers describe as a liberal magazine ; i think it is moderate , and if anything , a bit on the conservative side . ) needless to say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , for the harper 's index -- however , that was n't worth the price of a subscription ( it got to be the only thing worth anything for the price of the subscription ) .
0	i found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion ( not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford ) . the whole magazine is one big ad . if i wanted that , i could just turn on the tv
0	laptop mag can be best described negatively : it 's not a really serious computer magazine . it 's more or less like consumer guide , which is basically paid advertising . this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers . in the end , i feel this is a waste of money . besides , you can get all the info for free on the web , from cnet or zdnet , anyway
1	this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed ' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could . this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market , in my opinion , because it has excellent production values , i.e . luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions . as a bonus , the writing is superior and highly imaginative . an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets ' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched . i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band . in addition , this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the usa as they are in uk ; often these are bands that we might want to know better . the reviews section is always great , and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g . 'best r & amp ; b albums from the 1970 's , in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists . this magazine will have you finding , buying and liking albums by bands you 've never heard of , and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price
0	unfortunately , there seemed to be no recourse after i ordered this for 2 newphews as a christmas gift , and it did not arrive . i tried to send an email to amazon.com but got bumped to someone else ( distributor ? ) who never responded . so disappointing since it was a gift for someone else . happened not once , but twice
1	dwell is a unique ( in my opinion ) magazine and i like that . unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design , this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style . and as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra , i like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious . like in the april 2006 issue where aloft in the forest , where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown . using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements . yes , the magazine has ads , but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there , fit the style of the magazine . no fluffy dust catching junk
0	home business magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further . this magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end . i read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship . home business is the only one i read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and , unfortunately , it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be . probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way . i realize that people like lists but home business takes this a little too far . it makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac . for example , it is common to find a one page article with a title like `` effective ways to design a newspaper ad '' , or `` how to obtain quick financing '' . in each instance , these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question . this makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material . another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising . not only does it get out of hand , it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material . advertisements with titles like `` really lazy guy 's incredible little secret idea can make you rich '' , `` free $ 9.95 report shows you how to make a fortune '' , and `` six figures in six months '' clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package . some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it 's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating . i like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business . but even here , the stories are inconsistent . some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share . and to make matters worse , they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page . speaking of the advertising , this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess . advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement . the ads are posted everywhere , often right in the middle of an article , and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine . this magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine . in other words , this magazine has no continuity to it . it 's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the usa and then piecing them together into one magazine . starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good , timely information when you find yourself in this situation . home business , unfortunately , does n't perform its mission very well . if you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles . but the majority is too impersonal and too shallow ( not to mention smothered in advertisements ) to make this magazine worth the trouble .
0	i have n't received my subscription to sunset magazine yet . i ca n't review the actual magazine , but i can say they are very slow at getting new orders out
1	by far and beyond the best history periodical i have come across . and consistantly one of the best magazines i have read . i have subscribed for three years now-and that says a lot for me , especially given the price , since most magazines do n't keep my interest for longer than a year . i find myself dropping anything i am currently reading , magazines and books alike , until i have finished each one . easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into . the articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history . ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then , at the end , after being rivited by the narrative , you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself ? well , many times i find that this magazine does just that . every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all , unbeatable
0	i subscibe to this magazine . will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical . it is way overpriced even with the amazom , and others discount
0	there are very few serious articles in this magazine -- just tons of tidbits ( stats/facts/tips ) . by the time you get to the end it 's difficult to recall anything from the magazine ; it 's that shallow . occasionally there 's a good recipe , but that 's about it
1	how anyone can dismiss this magazine is beyond me . it 's the best . lessons learned ? chicks like dudes with money ! check ! chicks are totally into sex 24/7 ! check ! the new star wars movie is gon na rock ! check
1	i have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents . yes , the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities . but this is exactly something i want to read and evaluate , the marketplace of business opportunities . many of these are franchise opportunities , which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start . the articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful , but not all . the value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process . it was not until i read the e-myth revisited that i understood the value of these franchises . this magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy . the magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise . hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there
0	this magazine shows the negative side of black men . i find the magazine an embarrasement to the african-american community . it seems out of all the races of men in the world , black men seem to want to display their lack of self control , their love of fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which in no way helps create wealth in our communities . and i am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover . until , black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped , they will always be stopped by the police , be passed over for employment , and looked down upon . i wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community , showing respect and love for their women , and showing that everything is not hip hip !
0	ordered 11/27 - never received a single copy . not very fast is it ? slow company may be a better description . can i have my money back
1	this magazine is wonderful . it is very informative to the hip-hop culture . i am very happy with my decision
0	i subscribed to cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i had problems with issues that failed to arrive , and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern . since that time , i occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest . even by dint of casual glance , i 've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the `` perfect recipe '' for something or other . i now skip right to the `` perfected '' recipe , and decide whether its worth committing to memory . some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best . there are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range from just plain wrong to idiotic . the kitchenaid pro 600 was hailed by cook 's as the best in its class for many mixing chores . yet , the amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart , allowing the metal gears to separate . christopher kimball ( the editor ) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight . no , i 'm not joking . in that evaluation , le creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered for not having as much heft , and therefore was judged pricey , on a pound weight basis . one issue of cooks boasted on its cover `` unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others '' . apparently , hershey 's was designated best . not too many months later , callebaut was recommended above all others , and hershey 's was judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there are those dreadful editorials by mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , and punctuated with a picture of mr. kimball wearing a bow tie , and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it . mr. kimball is a humble man , with much to be humble about . he writes as if he were chanelling helen gurley brown , but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play . time to re-vamp this magazine , folks
0	i got my first month ( a horrible green day issue ) and then nothing ! uh , what up ? its not that good of a magazine , i just want what i paid for
1	looking for a nice well-rounded magazine with the major focus on contemporary interior design ? miss superb printing quality , clean european lines , meticulous attention to details ? you 've got it all in this magazine . after moving here in the us from a major european capital , i have frankly missed a good magazine with the latest trends in metropolitan interior design . architectural digest is great if you live in a grand mansion in ladue , but what if you want simple and elegant functionality of a nicely designed european apartment or loft in your typical suburban house . this magazine has been a delight to read ( nice coffee table edition too ) . it has been a source of ideas and inspiration for me for several years now . recommend highly
0	first off , i 'm a huge geek . i love programming and computers and the internet . you 'd think wired would be like some great magazine for me . but the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this `` bad '' stuff in the world , it makes you sick . for every cool article about japanese robots , you have to wade through like 10 articles about `` how america is doomed '' . whatever ... they need to man up
1	interesting may 05 issue . when i saw the cover i sighed and with a somewhat sinking heart picked it up wondering who `` now '' had declared war on america . oh ! why it 's only the christians now . this was a great issue . i had not read one in quite awhile and forgotten how funny and sad they could be . the harper 's index page is full of eyebrow lifting information . readings was great . the articles on the market economy and the religious right was a jaw dropper . i had to get up and look under the table to find where mine had fallen and rolled . most everyone knows this information in some depth and degree but . . . these articles were different . like some other books and articles i have read they are couched with the attitude of , `` wake up , please . throw some water on your face , look around and wake up , hurry before it 's too late '' . once you get through the large amount of heartbreaking information contained ( please tell me that america did not `sell ' cornmeal that we knew was going to starving people etc. , etc. , etc . ) you are deposited at karbola for an account of the sunni versus shia and then on to katmandu and the monarchy and maoists . the final article is on tango dancers and somewhat of a relief . after reading this you might want to go home and just pull the covers over your head . do n't . waddle around to another section and fiind a magazine called `` what is enlightenment ? '' the april/may issue has a equally jaw dropping set of articles on the market economy . it 's the perfect follow up to the harper 's . harper 's is a wake up call if you 've slept late . wie is the what can we roll up our sleeves and do about it . the people they interviewed are not pollyannas . several are quoted as saying that they really think there may be nothing left to do but totally dismantle the old system but they are willing to put that aside and focus on fixing instead of destroying and trying their hardest to make the new ideas work . they have some incredible contributers to the articles and to the new system they are trying to impliment . short articles from dadi janki and joseph p. milton are included . the article about tex gunning - president of unilever bestfoods asia and his new direction for his company is wonderful . these are people who are trying to shift the whole attitude of companies . it 's not the current spate of altrustic activity that is geared more toward upping sales with profit as the end result but a real shift to business conducted with the end result as a healthy , sustainable world . the end result would benefit humanity first , the business second and the shareholders third . novel concept eh ? they make you believe that it just may work . they are however very up front about the timeline and how many people have to be shifted - quickly - in order for it to work . read them both - it 's worth the time and i think that they both have something very important to say .
0	i had hopes that this magazine would be a nice alternative to the others out there . from the moment i opened it , it felt so smug . i gave it a chance and read it cover to cover ( the april issue ) . but what finally did me in ( after having read that i could buy an $ 800 blouse to make me feel pretty in that after pregnancy stage , that i could match my children 's shoes to my jimmy choo 's and finally that i could buy my child the latest $ 300 tricycle ) was the article entitled `` normal '' about a child who was misdiagnosed with autism . the article discussed how distraught the mother was after her child was diagnosed with autism to the point that she tried to committ suicide . the article ended with the fact that the child turned out to be a genius . what was the point of this article ? to say thank god it was n't true ? what about those parents out there who have an autistic child , how does this article make them feel ? the article was painful and insensitive . there are better ways to spend you $ 10 than on cookie
0	this is the worst magazine i have ever subscribed too . i hated it so much after the first issue that when new ones came , i thru it right in the trash . here why : 1- ad after ad for dietary supplements ( like dexatrim and stacker ) which i think cheapins the creditablity of the magazine b/c true health doesnt come from a bottle . 2- many pics of overly built up women ( think fitness competitions ) ... not something the average women can aspire too ... and too me , is nasty looking . 3-the information that was in it is general information that anyone with common sense already know ! my advice to you , avoid this magazine , unless you like body building or like looking at body builders
0	after falling in love with gourmet 's yellow cookbook , i subscribed to gourmet , hoping for the same great classic recipes and commonsense commentary . wow , what a disappointment . i have just received my second issue and , as another reviewer said , it is about 90 % ads for high-end luxury goods like jewelry and cars . the 6-page `` special advertisement section '' stops being so special when there are 20 of them in one issue ! what happened , ruth reichl ? the few recipes that one can find are unattractive and/or too difficult for even weekend cooking . for those cooks looking for a great cooking magazine , i highly recommend bon appetit over gourmet : the majority of the magazine is recipes and cooking tips , with only interspersed ads . i will be calling to see if i can get my subscription switched tomorrow .
1	my only gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in gq magazine : they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio . these people use only brand new tools ( brand name label showing of course ) in a perfect-world dust free environment . the pictures make it look like it 's a sears catalogue . aside from that , the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer . i have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine i subscribe to . most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools , making it an approachable magazine for the diy'er . i highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with fine homebuilding magazine . in that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment . the articles in handyman are a bit more down-to-earth , but together you will get the most benefit
1	i ordered a subscription to si for my boyfriend 's birthday , he was so excited and surprised ! his first issue came even before they said it would . i highly recommend the magazine for any true sports fan
1	why this magazine is so useful : 1 . always balances tech info , real personal histories and commercial info . 2 . it has tips for improving running performance . 3 . it has nutritional tips for runners . 4 . it has event 's list info . 5 . it has a shoes ' guide ( the most important runner 's stuff
0	today i purchased my first and probably last issue of gourmet . while there were plenty of recipes ( some of which i wo n't use but they were still cool to look at ) there were tons of ads . it makes you wonder either a ) how much the people who make this magazine get paid or b ) for all the ads why this is n't free . i can see the need for a few ads so that we the consumers do n't have to pay a fortune for a good magazine . but i took out 33 pages of ads and figured there were about 140 full page ads . that 's over half of the magazine which is 260 pages . that 's really sad . recipe wise , some of them look interesting and very gourmet , but there are things you need to have that i ca n't get in the middle of the u.s. and about three of the six articles were interesting to read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora of ads . fine cooking is still the best one out there
1	despite its name , this mag is n't just for brainy types . anybody who 's interested in knowing more quirky , fascinating things about the world around them -- presented in a highly readable , humorous style -- will find 'mental_floss ' a fun read . interested in the weird history of hackers ? ever wanted to know how to grow your own organs or wrestle an alligator ? all written by your smart , funny friend from college -- or so the mag 's super-accessible style will have you thinking . a definite recommend
0	i 've at various times subscribed to stuff , maxim , and fhm magazines . stuff was the only one i ended up not resubscribing to . it has its moments and the photography is fine . i would describe it as maxim 's younger brother . it 's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school , and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny , etc. , but it is forced and very juvenile . it just is snarky and predictable after awhile . on the other hand , i 'm not 21 anymore either , and maybe if i was in my 20 's i would find this the height of humor
1	this magazine is a great way to get a book club to focus on what to read next . basically the magazine is a collection of all sorts of `` best '' lists to suit every taste . the `` selections '' page starts with a collection of `` staff favorites '' highlighted with a one- ( do n't bother ) -to-five ( rarely given , a timeless classic ) star rating system . there 's a digest of 27 `` best books 2005 '' lists in a recent issue , a page on the whitbread awards , a selection of current and upcoming books , reader recommendations , new in paperback , a year in books ( e.g. , 1981 ) etc . coupled with very little advertising , it 's great !
0	i have n't received this item . it has been almost two months
1	`` better homes and gardens '' has been a staple in our home for years . this essential magazine seems to always be there for you . when i think about it i would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives . its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives
1	instyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there . it is much more reader-friendly than vogue - much cleaner layout , the font is easier to read , and the writing is clear , witty , and less dry . i 've been reading instyle for about 3 years , and each issue never disappoints me . the focus of the magazine is definitely fashion , but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news . the magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like vogue . my favorite section is `` the look '' which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label . instyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products . the best issue of the year is without a doubt in march or april when they do `` best beauty buys . '' after polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products , they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category . i 've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues , and it 's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that do n't work for you . it is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there , from hair care products to makeup . i have seen several women at sephora , clutching torn out pages from instyle 's best beauty buys and frantically searching for the right mascara . i understand that vogue is an institution now , but instyle offers a much better alternative , and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use .
1	most of this magazines travel articles and ads are not targeted at someone like me . i 'm a homemaker with a limited budget . i do n't travel much or am in the market for the fancy things they advertise . however , i just renewed my subscription becuase when i have tried the recipes in the magazine they were really wonderful . i 've added every recipe i 've tried from gourmet to my 'keeper ' recipe binder . i admit , the dishes were harder to make but the results were definitely worth the trouble
0	was n't worth the subscription . i found the magazine to be bland , full of ads and basically boring . all the information can be found doing a quick web search . highly disappointed
0	amazon must think we are fools . it 's $ 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website . on the other hand , there appear to be a lot of fools here
1	this is one of the best home décor magazines around today , and by far the best in the australian market . vogue living is always a great read , and is always full of beautiful and inspiring photographs . it regularly shows some of the most beautiful homes in australia , and around the world . so , if you 're interested in australian style , or just love looking at inspirational interiors , then vogue living is for you . i never throw a copy away
1	this gem of a magazine covers common sense topics of interest to health concsious readers , primarily young adult women . feature articles cover topics on `` fitness '' ( body ) , relationships and feelings ( `` mind '' ) , `` food '' , and `` guidance '' on specific health problems . the articles are well written and well researched . it contains delicious easy-to-make healthy recipes , beauty hints , as well as adventurous exercise options . some examples of great articles in the july-august 2004 issue are , the `` hike through history '' article , the `` one minute moves '' and the `` water workout '' article . the first describes hiking trails in different regions of the country , for instance , `` chesapeake ohio canal national park '' in washington , d.c. , `` d l trail ( norhtern portion ) in carbon county pennsylvania , and `` railroad grade trail '' in apache country , arizona . the second provides a first person account of a very satisfactory exersize program describing aqua yoga , kick-boxing , and circuit training . the `` one minute moves '' article provides photos and descriptions of very realisitic and doable exersizes for busy people . the food section has photos of farm fresh green beans , cut yellow squash , and sections of colorful bell peppers ... very excellent recipes follow . these foods are easily obtainable from any grocery store . there is also a tasty omelet recipe and some fresh fruit recipes which include melons , cantelopes , and honey dew . overall , this magazine is highly recommended for women readers of all ages . erika borsos ( erikab93

1	a great magazine filled with real world testimonials , expert advice , and everyday contributors . gearheads will enjoy the balanced product evaluations . frugalheads will enjoy advice on frugality . there are scheduled events and photo essays . part glamour shots promo - part hardcore dirt and sweat trail runner fanatic
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies . instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors . if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler ... this is not the mag for you .
1	car and driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine . it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track , which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world , and magazines like motor trend , which focus on the more practical . the magazine is always a fun , intereseting read , and keeps you up to date on teh auto world . i must , however , say , that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend , and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track ( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography . )
1	few magazines can match the new yorker 's high caliber of journalism , fiction , reviews , and of course , cartoons ; all written by some of the best writers in the land . it makes mainstream magazines like time and us news look like high school newspapers . but , one word of caution : if you 're the type of person that whines `` liberal bias '' at anything that you slightly disagree with , then this is not the magazine for you .
1	yeah , some of the stuff is way too pricey for me , but there are some really great ideas and articles in this magazine . i have the march-april issue , and among my favorites this month are : an article about how to diplomatically discipline other people 's kids , a gifted child who was misdiagnosed with autism , best adult friendly children 's music to download , and suggestions for artistic children 's books . furthermore , there is a price range for suggested products , some of which would fit most people 's budgets . an article on make-up features products from $ 8 - $ 65 . there is also an article on how to make a room habitable for 2 children , which is hardly targeted towards people who live in huge estates . do you buy vogue magazine and expect to be able to afford everything in it ? it 's not for some people , but it is for me , and i hope it does well
0	do n't be fooled by the cover and description , this is for a magazine only `` no dvd included ' , or should i say for a magazine containing mainly adverts for components and games . waste of time and mone
1	i 've been a subscriber for several years now . i was trying to decide between maxim and stuff . i chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining ( i.e . how to do doughnuts in your car , ect . ) they do have some photos of actors and such , but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of ... i would suggest this magazine
1	contrary to the previous review , the majority of the patterns in the fall/winter 2005 issue were normal sizes ( 5'6 '' ) . this particular issue contains 10 jackets ( two of which were for petites ) , four skirts ( one of them petite ) , three pants ( one petite ) , and four shells ( two petites ) . there were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves . the interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent . this particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa . the pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes , very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer . one thing i did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear . the magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions .
0	i admit , they have some good recipes , but most of them are not simple and very time-consuming . there is always a million ingredients in each little recipe . if you are a stay-at-home housewife and absolutely love to cook , buy this , but if you are just normal , you wo n't find many recipes in here for you . i suggest you consider 'cuisine at home ' before you buy this one
0	i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything about it . i was very disappointed . not enough recipes . the recipes that are included are not really ones that i would use .
0	i first subscribed to gq when it was still a quarterly ... an issue only every 3 months . back then it was primarily a men 's fashion magazine . it was sophisticated , useful and classy filled with clothing men could actually wear and practical grooming tips , trends and style . i suppose in many ways it resembled a ralph lauren print ad . now fashion is relegated to a few pages in the back of the magazine with men wearing things they seem to have found at a local flea market . nothing seems to fit properly , patterns - plaids - stripes ... anything goes . it resembles homeless couture . odds and ends that nobody should actually wear . sure the world has changed . but fashion , good taste , and quality are timeless despite tweaking and contemporary preferences . the editors may feel that grunge , hopeless edginess for it 's own sake and adolescent sloppiness sell issues . but they might be surprised that there 's a huge pent up demand for sophistication and real style , both formal and relaxed . i hope someone else picks up the torch .
1	one of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what 's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like imelda marcos ' shoes to life in china , a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world . time did a really good article on how google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance , makes you realise that human rights do n't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up ! the uk edition pretty much follows the usa edition , it 's an easy read , and what 's good is that every now and again time puts out a special edition which often follows a theme , the last one was on christopher columbus . worth getting a subscription , also you can do what i do , when you 've read a copy , give it to your local dentist or doctor for their waiting room
0	i would like to classify myself as a moderate but i probably lean conservative . because of that , i subscribed to harpers so that i could read good writing that would challenge my beliefs and stretch my mind in new ways . i got that , more or less , at first , but over the course of a couple of years the magazine drifted further and further to a leftist propaganda screed , the worst of which was louis lapham 's bitter drivel editorials . it got to a point where the writing was incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left of pelosi ) the writer -- any writer in harpers -- would take on whatever the issue was , and i had a pretty good idea of what the line of whining would be . if you attend dinner parties on the upper east side ; if you drive a prius to the oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming is an environmental travesty ; if you 've ever desecrated a starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine is for you . however , if you 're dumbfounded at how the republicans can keep winning elections -- and then you realize they have the democratic party as opponents ; if you realize the genius of george bush and karl rove is in getting liberals to underestimate george bush and karl rove ; if you want to read smart , insightful writing that will inform and entertain , then try the atlantic monthly ( which , by the way , i am surprised to see reviewers describe as a liberal magazine ; i think it is moderate , and if anything , a bit on the conservative side . ) needless to say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , for the harper 's index -- however , that was n't worth the price of a subscription ( it got to be the only thing worth anything for the price of the subscription ) .
0	as a child i remember finding this magazine at my doctor 's office and reading it because it was the only thing available . it has not changed much . there are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content . this magazine will neither stretch your child 's mind nor keep him entertained . it only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen . in the coming era of global connection , children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them . only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia
0	we subscribed to this magazine , in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets road log with each new subscription . what did we get ? a note letting us know that unfortunately `` the gift described in the promotion is no longer available '' and that `` rather than keep us waiting , ( they 've ) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute ... '' the substitute ? a crummy little pamphlet . i let it slide at the time , but several months later they were still offering this special promotion , so i wrote a letter to customer service stating that `` since they now had the special gift , perhaps they 'd be so good as to finally send ours . '' no response . time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again ... so against my better judgement , we did . and guess what ! another note `` unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available ... '' and the same crummy pamphlet ! in short , if you 're interested in being lied to , or receiving a stupid little pamphlet , by all means subscribe ... if you want what you paid for , go somewhere else .
1	this is a magazine . this is a magazine ? do yourself a favor and pick this up if you can get it for less than $ 20 an issue ( like i do at my local borders ) . excellent quality
1	i am a huge nelson fan and thought i was the only one left ; until i visited their website www.thenelsonbrothers.com . they are as hot as ever ! since `` after the rain '' they have released six more cd 's . i highly recommend the `` brother harmony '' cd , or the `` like father like sons '' cd , where they honor their late great father , rick nelson , by bringing back his music . they are currently available to come to your hometown and put on a performance that will leave you wanting more . to contact information on booking them for your area , please contact them at www.nelsontourinfo.com . hey ... it 's an awesome experience to see them in action . sincerely , kay javen
1	great magazine , with in depth articles covering interesting topics around the globe . i pity the fool who does not subscribe to n
0	hi , i am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $ 10 . this magazine is an embarrassment in every angle . it is full of pictures of `` sexy '' boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear . and pictures is all there is , for you that think there will be something interesting to read , read this : there is nothing in this magazine to read ! ! ! the latest issue contains of 48 ( forty-eight ) pages before you get to this issues contents . the first `` article '' starts on page 126 ( ! ) and is about `` why a man would like to slice of his testicles '' ! totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text ( letters that forms sentences ) on about 40 of them . besides this , the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not . well i can go on and on but i wo n't . unfortunately i have a subscription and i am going to see if i can get it canceled , i do n't even need my money back . take your $ 10 and run them in the disposal , it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than `` read '' this magazine
1	i love this magazine and i look forward to getting it in the mail every single week , unless if the last one was a double issue . then i have to wait another whole week , which can sometimes be painful . i love the reviews and the magazine is funny , fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies , tv , music , and dvds . the onlt complaint i have is lately they do n't have as many reviews for urban releases
1	as a freelance graphic designer only 6 months out of school , i would recommend this magazine to anyone else who is in the same boat . not only does this magazine site books that may help designers , but it also gives advice on what works - the profiles of top design studios would give anyone ideas on what they need to do to keep business flowing . i come from an entire family of designers , illustrators and art directors , all whom love communication arts - but that one is far too boring for me . how is more exciting , and for only $ 30 , it is at a very reasonable price
0	i found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion ( not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford ) . the whole magazine is one big ad . if i wanted that , i could just turn on the tv
0	spin will do anything to try and stay hip . i wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their `` tribute '' to kurt cobain mag . im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures . they were poorly written and dull . they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt 's music , and his impact on an entire generation . i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin..
1	i subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and southern accents is the best , bar none . the houses featured are absolutely dreamy -- the photography is gorgeous -- and while the magazine does n't offer how-to decorating ideas , there is so much inspiration . i find it to be intelligently written ... which is rare in a decorating magazine . the articles on antiques are particularly informative . this magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful , classic design -- whether or not you live in the south
0	simply stated , if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority , buy the mag . i 'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons
0	as a practicing photographer and not a collector , i 've been very disappointed with b on the few occasions it 's crossed my desk ( i 've never had a subscription , so i 'm basing this on just the few issues i 've seen ) . quality wise , the last issue i received was poorly printed - it contained streaks through the images and rampant misregistration , among other things . the paper is unimpressive as is the printing itself - the line-screen looks quite course . in a full-colour magazine , it would be fine , but for one in which everything is in monochrome , i would expect that they would print stochastically or at a higher resolution etc . in terms of content , every time i 've seen this magazine it has been filled with work which is typically very well-executed technically but un-innovative and un-inspirational , at least to me . most of it is of the hobbyist/dedicated amateur variety , with few capital-a artists or professionals . stereotypical nature and bodyscape-style photos seem to dominate , with few examples of conceptual , thematic or `high art ' work , and i 've never seen any fashion or photo-journalism either . we could use more non-technical photography magazines , but b caters to an audience obsessed with traditionalism and the imitation of old masters such as cartier-bresson and ansel adams . ps : reading body copy set in futura with tight leading is a real pain
1	i read the nation for its poetry , katha pollitt and takes on the news . it 's a left wing magazine . i do n't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect `` objectivity '' . humans have opinions and viewpoints . even time magazine and the national review have viewpoints .
1	i stumbled across this little gem almost by accident , and what a surprise it was . the sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime . we never forget the lessons of our youth , and each issue , like a great short story , will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature . and yes , you will return ... time and time again . are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading anna karenina ? perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the great russian novels , providing fodder that , like all firm foundations , could change the course of your life . if it 's the modern classics that you 're interested in , one almost ca n't help but think along the lines of john knowles . life marches on , and we choose whether to change or be changed . much is out of our control in this world , but what we choose to read is not . regardless of your personal paradigm , you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work . while the idea of a holiday gift might seem obvious , why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription ? does your friend really need that springsteen coffee table tome ? even as a belated wedding gift , it would no doubt be appreciated . do n't stand around in bookstores , starbucks in hand , flipping through page after page anymore ... oh , you do n't do that , huh ? no , neither do i . just subscribe now . i hope to find one in my mailbox soon . -timothy mcphail , avondale estates , ga
1	i 've read the new yorker since 1963 and though it seemed a better magazine then , it is still a very good magazine now . as magazines go , it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published . for good writing , reporting , cartoons , and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine . and their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue . i do n't believe any issue in all the years i 've read it has n't had at least a couple items of interest , with some of the issues being read from front cover to back . try a copy , it might just be for you . semper fi
0	this magazine fell apart so quick . they are no longer a unbias magazine . instead they are a interscope propaganda machine . just look at the covers ? every year shady/g-unit gets a automatic 8 covers . every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings . even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop . as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt . i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag
1	my husband and i love getting our monthly subscription . we read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered . we often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we 've read about . variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together . if you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag , check out intense games dvd , it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality . really
1	what i like about this magazine is that it does not focus on mainstream attractions and destinations . it tries to go off the beaten path , and provides many suggestions of places to visit , restaurants to eat at , and even specific places to shop . not only that , on every issue they have a list of awesome travel tips provided by travelers . in addition they list great travel specials and the corresponding websites . i 've been a subscriber for approximately 6 months , and i have to say that i enjoy this magazine .
0	2 months after ordering , i have year to get my first issue . i 'm sure i 'll like it ... if i ever get it
1	what is not to like , from cover to cover . all beautiful models and international models . great magazine
0	like a reviewer below said , this magazine was good a while back . try back in 2002 . it used to have better tips and less filler . now , it 's all filler . seriously . there are maybe 5 quizzes which do n't say much , a `` dream decoder '' which is complete phooey , and yes , the many tweeny posters that i 'd be embarassed to have on my wall , even if i were 11 . i grew , but sadly , this magazine did not , let alone stay the same . nothing is serious in here , it 's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read . age reccomendation : 9-12 simply put , this magazine is like m magazine , but not as infantile
1	i really look forward to receiving this every month . i am blown away by all their crafty ideas for art projects , organization , and meals . really fun
1	i love travel mags , and this one is like the magazine adventure , but adds more of a tourist bent without losing the original edginess that is adventure writing
0	lucky magazine makes me feel not so lucky . it makes me sad that i can not afford all the items they put in their magazine . one month they tell me round-toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that i would love to own of which 2 i can afford . then the following month lucky tells me round-toed shoes are out and square-toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures . you get the idea ? this magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you ca n't afford all the great things it is showing . i did enjoy lucky for it 's profiles on upcoming designers , some great website links , and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section . i also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways . most of the time , though , i felt sad and envious after i finished reading it . these are feelings i 'd rather not encounter . i think i would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing , maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases .
1	based on the reviews i read here , i purchased oxygen and loved it . i signed up for a subscription that day . two months later i have not received my first issue ; but , i have received three `` payment due '' notices and customer service claims two issues have been mailed out to me . i got tired of waiting and canceled the subscription . i 'd rather buy it at the bookstore the day the issue comes out than receive it in the mail 3-4 weeks late
1	today i received the first issue - april 2006 issue . i found it amazing and informative resource for body , mind and soul practices toward healthier life.. the most thing i liked about this magazine is that it respects religions . it provides accurate information from various religions to help people of other believes improve their lives .
0	i used to enjoyed discover , but the past several months of their radicals changes , got me to think a real dumbing down.once in awhile , they would put together a good article - but not constantly.how can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.there are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.discover 's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky and telescope , science news havent fallen down.i am not renewing my subscription unless discover 'rediscovers ' itself.how dumb americans are !
1	golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game . for these types , nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course , but golf digest comes very close . this magazine contains over 200 pages each month , dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf . the things that set golf digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews . other golfing publications attempt to help you learn , but they often get too mechanical . golf digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals , including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like tiger woods . besides all the tips and tricks , golf digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game . this personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine 's overall appeal , providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine . golfing digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course , but it comes close . i consider it the best publication of its kind and i recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game .
0	the recipes included are good , but this is not a `` cooking '' magazine . this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise . while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness , it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine . there is way too much other junk . if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine , i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that .
1	i love this magazine , and am on my third year . the recipes are interesting , healthy and easy to make after a day at work . they do n't use fake ingredients , which was my complaint with cooking light - i 'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance . and the recipes do n't take all day and 24/7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in gourmet . the nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps . real food for real life
1	i was very surprised by the reviews below because i found this magazine absolutely wonderful ! ! the articles range from architecture , to renovated homes , to specific garden types to the average home owner . i found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well . the pictures are great and i find myself tearing things out every month ! fantastic for anyone interested in design , art , or interior decorating
0	i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents ' subscription . it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about . frankly , the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack ; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters . a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers -- to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story -- any future coverage is designed to prove time 's initial position correct . the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event ; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories -- '' we told you so , we told you so . '' even worse , the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story . ca n't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn ? out of sight , out of mind is the mantra ... in fact , i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media ; newspapers are failing , television news ca n't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis . neutrality is dead . frankly , i do n't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant . time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states -- no more . iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page . african states are making vast strides towards democracy , we get an article about nigerian computer fraud . russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy , but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq . japan , one of the world 's most influential cultures , in the week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein 's puerile take on pornography and social deviants . but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks : how in the hell did our world become boring ? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer ? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage -- educate the reader about the world in which we live ; do n't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week . time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine , if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
1	family circle is aimed at female readers with articles focusing on topics like parenting , marriage , etiquette and beauty and fashion . each issue also features an article on women who make a difference . there is also a health report article , fitness articles , and diet tips , including menus and recipes . there are lots of recipes , in fact , including pull out recipe cards that can be filed in your recipe box . there are also articles on gardening , decorating ideas , and craft ideas . a reader 's tip column pays readers $ 50 , if their tips are used . family circle is a good magazine for all women .
1	i love the city . its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world . 'new york magazine ' captures some of this , and works to be fashionable and fast , glossy and up-to- date , stylish and hip ( if that is still the word . ) i sort of like some of this , but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic . and a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league . but 'new york ' often has wonderful writing . i cite here james atlas as a particularly good contributor . and it tells you things about the city no other magazine does . some of those things old conservative me will not read . but at times there are pieces here that can not only be 'fun ' but give a real feeling why the big apple is still the 'empire state building ( or flatiron building ) of all the great cities
0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided , why not ? ? its been a year and , although the previews of each week 's prime-time programs are fun ( 2 pages worth ) i was very dissapointed . the articles are empty , boring and some downright retarded ; rehashing show 's dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around . i realize this is an entertainment magazine , but still , the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide - much more interestin
1	this magazine is very accessible when in comes to current music news and also offers alot of others sections as well that are equal interesting . it informs you about upcoming artists as well as established acts .
1	asimov 's provides 11 issues annually , packed with science fiction novellas , novelettes , short stories , poems , book reviews , and editorial articles . as with any anthology or anthology-magazine , the story quality varies , but there are some true gems . alan m. steele wrote a series of stories for asimov 's , beginning with the wonderful `` stealing alabama '' and including the stunning `` the days between '' . these stories were later combined in the novel `` coyote '' . one value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know . several years ago , george r. r. martin wrote a short story for asimov 's that i found enthralling . it turned out to be a portion of martin 's then-upcoming novel , `` a game of thrones '' , which is in itself the first in a series of books ( now going on four , rumored to be seven overall ) called `` a song of ice and fire '' and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series . overall , asimov 's is a science fiction buffet ; you get a little taste of everything , some of it good ( kage baker 's `` company '' series ) , some of it great ( martin 's and steele 's above-mentioned stories ) , and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy ( i do n't care for elliot fintushels ' `` izzy '' series )
1	if you really love sports , there is no finer magazine than si . the breadth and depth of the coverage is unequalled by any other mag . the pics are the best on earth . the writing is tops . sign me up for another 24 months
1	for this registered libertarian , this is a pretty good magazine . decent articles that are written well and easy to read , as well as being informative . it has been around quite a while and the experience shows ( in a positive way )
0	this magazine should be free , since there are so many advertisements . also , it is strictly modern decorating , unlike the editor 's claims . if you like extreme , modern style , try it out ; otherwise invest in something else
1	*fashion tips for girls of all sizes and styles ( preppy , sporty , punk , etc . ) *make-up tips *stories about girls experiences with abuse , guy trouble , etc
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out .the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole . it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections ' of the country . the reporting itself is clear and very readable . the paper lacks weight and depth . it has a lot of variety in its features , and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable . it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers .
0	i know apr is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there , and i think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine , but it 's more of the national enquirer of poetry magazines . it 's a large , newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles . you 'd be better off subscribing to poetry , the hudson review , the texas review , tar river poetry , or any number of other journals
1	i frequently read 'new criterion ' articles on the 'arts and letters daily ' website . they are usually of high- quality and well- worth reading . hilton kramer and roger kimball the editorial writers , mark steyn the drama critic ( and also one of the best writers on world- affairs around ) jay nordlinger ( the music critic ) are among the regulars in a solid and respectable cast of writers . the great joseph epstein also writes here . the articles in 'the new criterion ' give the sense that there is a living 'high culture ' , and this in spite of the often critical stance to many modern cultural developments .
1	xxl is much better than the source and vibe it will always be my favorite magazine keep it up xx
1	there was a time when i read a lot of magazines . i found there being too much fluff and not enough stuff . i was introduced to fast company in 1997 , and have been a subsriber for most if not all of the last 8 years . every issue has relevant topics on the current state of business . it has stayed with a formula that has worked ; that business in constantly changing , and to reflect back on the past when something has changed that they once wrote on . i heartily recommend this must read to anyone who wants to make a difference in the business world
0	if your into lesbians , sluts and mild porn than this is the rag for you . if your looking for a rag about american v-twins and babes then go somewhere else , cause your wasting your money with anything easyrider has its hands on . for this price i would buy hustler or penthouse .
1	first , i 've bought the magazine just about every months ( for 6 months ) but i liked it so much that i 've decided to subscribe for it . if you are into the shabby , cottage , romantic home decoration then you gon na love it ! i must tell you that the pictures are sooo inspirational , that when i put the magazine down i ca n't resist the urge to decorate and come up with great ideas ! however these fabulous homes/shops futured in the magazine look very expensive , cost lots of bucks to put together ! if you have planty of $ $ , then it 's not a problem but the average person does n't . so that 's the time to get creative ! i 'd say get the decorator books out too , that will help ! personally i dont ' pay too much attention for the articles since about 80 % of the time the shop/home owners only talking about how much they like to live/work in their great romantic cottage environment , which designer helpd them to get the look or which part of europe they flew to purchase that chandalier and so on ... but not a word of advice about decorating ! the other 20 % of the time you get designers , or other people talking about the look , etc . that is useful . there 's also a great list of websides at the back of the magazine where you can shop on line or at one of the first pages quite often a few beutiful object futured ( sometimes it 's even affordable ) ! there are not too many adds here , like in other magazines that sometimes you ca n't find the end of the article..so that 's a big + too !
1	old mac usr , new mac usr , matters not . there is something in this magazine for everyone . and , icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too .
0	disney , just about the worst company on earth , has many lines of magazines . this is just used to suck even more money , even though they already have so much money that they 're kids drown to death in money . then disney goes on to cancel dave the barbarian and teacher 's pet , the only good disney shows
0	love to review history today , but have n't seen a copy yet . any ideas
0	the adage holds steady with this magazine . what , to the hip consumer , appears to be a hopeful window into the world of cool turns out to be completely empty . it would be insulting how hard they try to represent the scene of new york , if it were n't so embarrassing . get the village voice . try the other coast with interview . just stay away from this disgusting fluff
1	very interesting with nice pictures . gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world
0	to be honest , i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year , but i can hardly call myself a fan . if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag , wired is not for you , it tries too hard to be hip and trendy , but it 's group of left/lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish . wired needs to be `` rewired '' to meet the needs of the modern tech community
1	i subscribed to ws for a couple years in the late 90s , and loved the magazine . it keeps a balance between reviews of wines both new ( which is the main emphasis ) and older vintages , and background stories on vintners and so on . the writers are almost all very good ( and i 'm a professional writer myself ) -- only one of them do i dislike and he does n't review the wines . both the wine connoisseur and the novice can profit from reading this publication . i only dropped the subscription because i moved and the collection , no issue of which i wished to discard , was occupying more and more space on my bookshelves . now i subscribe to the online edition so i can check ratings before i buy a wine . the ws , in addition to parker and other reviewers , perform an essential service for critical consumers who ca n't otherwise judge whether a bottle is worth the price asked . and we need ws and parker and all to tell us when the best reds are ready to drink -- some really great ones are not mature for more than a decade . i drank the highly rated chateau canon 1982 , for which i 'd paid over $ 100 , 17 years after harvest , and my group could tell it was n't ready -- still closed down . sure enough , if i had read spectator carefully , i 'd have picked another bottle for that occasion because they said it was n't yet mature . robert parker has the reputation for being more influential for high-end wines , but wine spectator 's scores are generally pretty close to his . and they review a broader spectrum , as noted by other commentators below . ws will often steer you to excellent buys for under $ 15 , or even under $ 10 . if you get only one of these per month , or steers you away from a very overpriced bottle , the subscription ( about $ 50 ) pays for itself
0	lots of lovely photos , great ideas , deco tips and food
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it . all i can say is the amazom service is terrible
1	i 'm 25 years old and new to the atlantic [ monthly ] . not having read the publication for some twenty-odd decades like the rest of the reviewers , my opinion is this : the magazine is wonderful . it 's infinitely more literate and illuminating than most other periodicals . i 'm letting my subscription to time run out ( talk about an `` also-ran '' ... ) . some of what the other reviewers have said is true : there do seem to be an awful lot of stories about war/armed forces , and at times i would concede a slight liberal bend . but neither are enough to dissuade me from continuing my subscription . so `` younger '' readers , my advice is switch off the tv , throw out your news weeklies , and subscribe . ( but keep visiting cnn.com to stay abreast of current news -- this is only a monthly magazine !
0	i used to sell and fix macs since the original mac 128 , i have owned 14 macs over 21 years so i have seen it all . mac addict is ok but only because our choices are so slim . mac user was always the best and i could n't bother renewing macworld after they got nasty with my late payment after i bought it for almost 20 years . i quit buying macaddict because of all the free disks . they were full of buggy freebies and ii turned me off . to keep up with macs , read the ny times in the circuits section and david pogue 's column , web site . also . if you can afford the wall st journal , read walt mossberg for all techy things . he gives a fair review and answers any questions he can , mac pc , camera . the wash post on line has a good tech writer for mac stuff.we reallt do n't need a magazine with the web . happy mac-ing and order tiger . i just got my new ipod photo 60 gig and a 1gig shuttle which i use every day in the gym . buy applecare and apple will cover the ( probably ) 2 batteries . i have an original ipod ( 10gig in 01 ) and the battery still works and i abused it on many plane trips . it still runs and is my bedroom pod hooked up to my bose cd/radio . yeah i love toys . roger taylo
1	great magazine . keeps nyers informed of what 's going on in the city and has a great crossword puzzle , to boot
1	there are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days . so many of them are geared toward a political party , instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important . `` reason '' magazine is the exception , and with its motto that a `` free mind implies a free market '' and vice versa , it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto . the authors who write for it definitely have their biases , but they are attentive to these biases , and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound . many times this reviewer heard that the authors and editors of reason are `` socially liberal '' but `` fiscally conservative . '' this kind of description almost implies that their thinking is a mere hybrid of liberalism and conservatism . but this description is incorrect , for the content of the articles in reason is a consequence of the general belief among its authors and editors that freedom , and that means first freedom of the mind , is a moral universal , regardless of the place and context in which one finds oneself . the `social liberalism ' of reason , if one is to call it that , manifests itself in the tolerance of ideas that one finds repugnant . the `fiscal conservatism ' of reason manifests itself in the belief that freedom is to be not subject to an arbitrary and coercive government that has no qualms about using deception or actual force to collect taxes , impose censorship , or generally violate individual rights . there are always many fine articles written in reason on a diversity of topics . the advocacy of biotechnology is refreshing and reflects a common sense attitude that is very rare in political debate on this branch of technology . one will also find commentary on government waste , propaganda , torture , and the `` war '' on drugs . in addition , many book reviews are included on books that are relevant to the issues that the magazine wants to address . one can only hope that reason stays afloat and delivers many more insights in the years to come . the magazine is both a barometer of freedom of thought as well as its creation .
1	a great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on . i have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by editor jason sizemore 's growing tome to the darker side of sci-fi . with solid interviews and strong fiction by established pros like william f. nolan , ben bova , tom piccirilli , neil gaiman and brian keene and talented newcomers like bryn sparks , jenifer pelland , and eugie foster you ca n't miss with this one
1	there is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on amazon with the high-brow reviews found in the lrb . one surveys average readers , and the other is the opinion of people who make a living writing about books . i , brockeim , am more like the people than the professionals , and believes most of you are as well
1	if you are into cars or know of someone who is than this magazine should make you or them happy . lots of cool pratical information and pictures for when you are in the market or just want to see what is hot and why . besides reviews and ratings for most consumer friendly autos there are nice features on those dream-mobiles that most of us only fantasize about . there are also nice articles on auto shows , a section called trends where gossip aand opinions blend to pique your interest . there is usually an interview with some automobile innovator or mainstay too . the breakdown of an autos profile is helpful if you are shopping for a new vechicle or you just like to compare what is out there . even if you are not in the market it is an entertaining magazine for browsing . the featured concept cars , which often never get into production or limited production are worth checking out since most of us will never see one , let alone own one . a pretty good magazine for the car lover in your family
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift . i paid for it on nov. 21 '05 . it is now feb. 19 '06 , and my daughter has not yet recieved her christmas present ! i will never again place an order with amazon ! barnes and noble has proved to be very efficient and worthy of my business . i will at this point try to get my money back from this company , and my daughter can purchase the magazine and all the missed issues off the newsstand
1	i first picked up a copy of nylon in chicago , while browsing the newsstands . i was n't sure if i would like it -- years of subscribing to vogue , elle , and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good . and yet i always manage to be drawn to the racks . nylon was different from the get go . they always feature unknowns on the cover , and when , on occassion , a well-known celebrity is featured , the stories give us a new perspective on them . nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself . i could spend hours paging through each feature , marveling at the graphics , and the way the magazine is put together . i love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands . nylon also makes a point of covering bands , movies , and fashion designers that , until now , have remained obscure . everything they feature is amazing -- most of the music they recommend ends up on my amazon wishlist ! i would highly recommend nylon to anyone and everyone . this obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout , and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered
1	the whole dog journal should be mandatory for anyone that loves their dog . the information found in this magazine is the best i have ever seen regarding the health and happiness of any dog . the editor and contributing writers are the best in the dog world . they tell the whole truth about dogs that you will not find anywhere . and this information can and has been lifesaving . you will not find better information anywhere
1	we subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old . our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well . we all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail . i enjoy flipping through it myself . you 're never to old to learn fun facts about nature ! ! a perfect gift
0	when i first started reading this magazine back in 2003 i thought `` oooh what a cool mag ! ! '' but clearly i was totally wrong . since 2003 seventeen has changed from a girly sophisticated mag appealing to girls just barely in their teens to to a cheap , overated , cliche` , piece of crap ! ! ! i 'd like to know what happened ! ! ! ! ! it 's super boring now . it has no style . all the sections are about health garbage boring global trash . hello ? what about the stars , movies , .. the music section sucks ! nothing is good anymore ! if you disagree with me your probably just as boring as it yourself . i hate it and i do not recomend this magazine . do n't read it ! ! you 'll be wasting your time
1	my wife loves this magazine so i bought her a one-year ( 6 issues ) subscription through amazon.com for $ 25.60 . that turned out to be a foolish and impulsive move on my part when i found out that i could have subscribed directly from healthy cooking for $ 14.95 for one year or $ 19.95 for two years . although i have realized significant reductions on book costs , clearly this magazine subscription is excessively priced . i will shop more carefully in the future .
0	the reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight , but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna-be 's of true cultural wits like mencken and updike . some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns , and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable . i 'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag , and save your money to buy books that nourish you .
0	i ordered this as a gift subscription on may 10 . by july 20 , it still had not arrived . i contacted customer service , and was told it would n't arrive until september ! the description says it will take 6-10 weeks . it has now been 10 weeks , and i 've been informed it will be another 6 weeks
1	my boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot . i also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women . for example , there are fresh articles about fashion , cars , gadgets , sex and even celebrities . i read them with interest and skip the models , which i guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys . well , that 's fine . i am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend does n't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex . that 's why i do n't mind when he lists maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women . maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble . overall , it is a very good , high quality magazine , which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information , and i am sure that you will enjoy each issue .
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money . thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else . but instead i 've paid and never received it . i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else , so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off . they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point , it 's been a couple months now
0	i liked time magazine a lot until they named george bush person of the year ? oh my god , where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article
0	i 'm sure that this review is n't unique . spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover , not to mention the ridiculous articles written within . by the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound ' i 've completely forgotten the point of thier article . they must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com . i 'm sure that i 've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin . next time you see it on the stands , i suggest you spin in another direction
1	this magazine is the best one out there . if your a hardcore ps2 gamer , get this for a year or two . ive gotten this since it was still psone magazine and i have never seen one bad issue . they give you reviews that are % 97.9 of the time helpful . you know the 're serious 'cause they write down entire levels ! plus they got swimsuit issues ! a must for the gamer . -xesx
0	this magazine makes girls who feel geeky and nerdy bad , and girls who are normal teens who have crushes , and like to stay in style , terrible ! plus , this magazine is sexist ! it does n't have models anywhere , because it says that it makes girls feel bad ! if you want a magazine that is good and inspires , read american girls , or girls life !
1	i love entertainment weekly . this is a magazine that has everything current ... outline of plot , reviews for movies , music , tv , dvds , books . it keeps you current . it is the one magazine that i go through from cover to cover
0	the title speaks for itself . i do n't know how or why i was drawn to this magazine when i was 14 . this magazine should be called j-4tweens . ah . the title is very annoying . like twist , i only get this magazine when i 'm really really desperate for something to read . i sure as hell would n't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara . if you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress , get this . the only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things ( but of course ) . other than that , no . they feature pretty bland fashion . all in all , this magazine is just like twist . therefore , the age reccomendation is just 11 12 , but you 're better off getting gl for even more years worth of goodness ( 10-15 yrs . ) because no , it 's not cool to steal your sister 's damn boyfriend for pete 's sake
1	i came across `` olive '' when i was in london this past may ( 2005 ) . it was a free supplement to that month 's issue of `` bbc good homes '' , so i was n't expecting much originally . am i ever glad i did n't just toss it in the bin as i would normally do ! `` olive '' is devoted to cooking that is , as my title suggests , simple , elegant and healthy . great editorial photography makes that food look great , and all its ' recipes use readily available ingredients . each recipe is short , telling you what you need and how to prepare it , and not much more . sidebars or runners at the bottom of the page contain info related to the recipes , such as how to cook the perfect steak ( i.e. , `` bring the steak to room temperature ; use a very hot pan '' and `` oil the meat not the pan '' ) . under the section `` fast food '' , one of these recipes was for mini wellingtons , has only 5 ingredients and is ready in 30 minutes . another section details how to make a signature nobu ( the famed sushi restaurant in nyc london ) dish , cod with miso , and the recipe is n't at all intimidating ( although obtaining some of this dish 's ingredients might be difficult unless you have access to an asian market or similar online site ) . gi diet followers can also benefit from `` olive '' as nearly all the recipes contain gi-related nutritional information . chef gordon ramsay also edits a column and shares his favorite tips and recipes . the only reason i give `` olive '' 4 stars instead of 5 is because many recipes contain both metric and imperial measures . however , conversion info for the metric measures is easily available online . `` olive '' also uses british stove/oven indications , such as `` heat the oven too 200c/fan 180/gas 6 '' but i was easily able to convert these to fahrenheit . so why subscribe to `` olive '' instead of an american cooking magazine ? if you are like me , american cooking magazines can be frustrating , in that recipes are often ( and unneccessarily , imo ) complicated , and better suited to those who cook for the purpose of entertaining large groups of people . many healthy cooking magazines do n't contain gi index info , and fail to present it in an easily understood way . many cooking magazines 'on this side of the pond ' also are chock-full of ads , and you have to get through them before you can get to the recipes or information that prompted you to buy the mag in the first place . `` olive '' is clean , uncluttered , and appeallingly presented . what 's not to like ?
0	it would be nice if i were writing about the magazine content here but since i never received a single copy of my subscription.all i can say is their customer service sucks ! ! ! ! after repeated attempts to correct the delivery address or find out what happened the issue still has n't been resolved . note ; i 've had a number of delivery problems when ordering magazines on amazon ( there might be some glitch ) .however the other magazines have quickly corrected the problem soon after contact .
0	i have seen many craft magazines come and go . i hope this one goes . granted , there is no commercial advertising in it , but paying anything over $ 1.98 per issue would be too much . the crafts are mainly useless , juvenile , and lack polish . i purchased my subscription sight unseen because it was through supporting a local school ( the only saving grace to this whole experience ) , but that is a mistake i will not make again . it took at least three months after ordering it that i finally received my first issue . i opened it with great expectation of finding original and practical crafts for my home , but was immediately thoroughly disappointed . thankfully , my subscription will be expiring soon . if you are a serious crafter , i recommend passing by this one .
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift , and , so far , the first two issues have been sent to me rather than to the intended gift recipient . there must be a better way to handle gift subscriptions . i supplied the address of the gift recipient when i placed this order . the same thing happened last year , and i do not intend to order gifts from amazon again
0	this magazine is a waste of money and bores me . nothing here to see but ads
1	touchstone features articles , editorials , book reviews and other material from the perspective of protestant ( both mainline and evangelical ) , catholic and orthodox christians who hold to traditional , orthodox understandings of christian morality . it tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-christian culture . while it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost ( see the july/august 2003 issue on `` christian unity the divisions we must sustain '' ) , it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree . the publisher , the st. james fellowship , also produces an excellent devotional guide : the st. james daily devotional guide for the christian year , available by subscription though [ ... ]
1	i really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it ! every parent should read this magazine ! really good activites and advice .
0	i used to really like us magazine . i have been collecting every issue each week for several years now . but wait ! has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year ? where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities , movies and music ? there 's no more than a thumbnail 's sketch of info on anything now . it 's all photos and quickie hype . it has no more substance . what happened to this good magazine
1	detailed articles , and interesting columns . balanced , and not afraid to be critical where appropriate .
0	i cancelled my subscription to this magazine 6 months ago with a letter to the editor stating that i loved to see nude woman , but subscribed to learn from the masters about photography . i can not tell you how disappointed i was when i resubscribed after not taking the magazine for years ... it used to be a wonderful magazine chock full of insightful articles , lighting techniques , studio setup diagrams , lots of great stuff ... i subscribed to a 2 year deal through an online subscriber and asked them to quit sending it after only 6 months and to keep the money . not worth the paper it is printed on- period . apeture i hear is pretty good , and i also hear popular photography has gotten much better and now only 95 % about advertising and product reviews and at least 5 % helpful tips and tricks..
0	truly this is the magazine of the warmongers , the neocons , who would gladly repopulate america completely with non-europeans , except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts , who are of `` a race of the mind , '' as one wag put it , by and large . pro-war and anti-american people ( and certainly anti- euro-american people ) , this magazine is truly one to be boycotted . if you are an american of european descent the american conservative will more likely be for you . if you are racially aware and do n't wish to see your people vanish from the earth , i would also recommend the occidental quarterly . to give the devil his due , tws does carry some interesting book reviews at times . if you love your people , as long as they are not from `` the race of the mind , '' do not buy this magazine , and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund , as i did a few days ago . highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections , neo-conned ! and neo-conned again
1	this magazine is wonderful . it is very informative to the hip-hop culture . i am very happy with my decision
0	i subscribed to this magazine in august and just received the september issue now ! budget travel 's customer service is terrible , i 've complained several times but am still missing the august , october and november issues , have asked for a refund but have yet to have my account credited
1	i say almost due to the fact that aperture gives them a good run for the money . you know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising ? this is not it ! if you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques , get this one ! if you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer 's , get this magazine ! if you want a hot collectible , get this magazine ! ! ! yes there are ads in here , but not a ton of them . for you guys ( and girls ) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed , get this magazine . one of the aspects of this magazine that i like , is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page , unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos . and this one is a hot collectible , though the french version of it is an even hotter collectible . whether it 's nature , special effects , or provocative photography , this one is a superb magazine . in short , this one is a must get for the photography fan
0	this magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year , meaning most reviews prior to april 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine . i was a subscriber since the early 90 's and have recently cancelled . this magazine had a mid ( end of life ? ) crisis and now wants to cover just about anything that uses electricity . and cars ! why would i pick up pc magazine to read a car review ? their `` improved '' layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows and `` cool '' sayings to replace actual review content . what is their market here ? 12 year old geeks with an extra $ 80k laying around to drop on an suv ? get real . until this magazine makes another radical change in direction to get back on topic , it is best avoided
0	as a professional photographer , i think the organization that publishers this magazine has truly lost their way . the images are predictable and unimaginative and have n't changed in the past 25 years . there are much better magazines to read
1	this magazine offers a complete guide to shooting anything that takes me outdoors
0	first issue arrived today . after tearing up 8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult to read the magazine , i sat back to enjoy . first article was a lecture by robert f. kennedy jr. on the danger of mercury in fresh water domestic fish . perfectly safe to fish we are informed ( well duh ) . just do n't eat what you catch . expectant mothers should be extra careful as babies with high level of mercury have lower iqs . the net is full of peer-reviewed studies from major universities on the subject of mercury poisoning . why buy a food magazine to read what an activist lawyer has to say about the subject ? next article was in : `` politics and the plate '' . the controversy here concerns local and season foods . gourmet asks : `` are those who promote them sincere ? or is it just a come on for gullible diners ? '' so who does gourmet think is `` gullible '' ? the reader ? implication seems to be the reader is too stupid to figure out that yes , vendors might promote locally grown products that are n't all that terrific . nothing of substance in this article at all . going back to the front , an editor of gourmet recalls how her late father did n't appreciate health food stores ( are n't fathers stupid ? ) . three downer articles in a row . i gave up . this is n't the magazine i remember from 20 years ago . even the format is annoying . it is difficult to know where ads end and articles begin ( recall the most junked up website you 've seen , that is the gourmet model ) if you do enjoy the politics and the environmental stuff ( on either side ) you can do better on the net for free . if you want entertaining , informative articles on food , gourmet is not the place to look . subscribed to saveur at the same time as gourmet . it is a pleasure to read . no annoying ads , no political screeds . great photographs . interesting and exotic recipes . as good or better than gourmet was decades ago .
1	i love this magazine . i love the pictures and articles ! it brings back so many memories ! !
0	ordered my wife a subscription last christmas . recieved 2 issues , never got the rest of them . i 'll never order magazines through amazon again .
1	what a great magazine - its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months - most of which are totally wearable . i really feel this mag . rides the line between fashionable and practical . i have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue . the directions could use a bit more description - sometimes the designers think you can read their minds , but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store wo n't fix . there are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep - something you would n't think was interesting , but then you start reading it and ca n't put it down . love the book reviews and ads - i ordered a dvd from one of the ads and am so , so happy with it . i also bought a book after reading the review and have been enjoying it . keep in mind that these are `` fashion models '' and really try to picture your body in the item before you go spending a lot of time on a fitted tank that will make you look massive . i got this as a gift and will definitely be renewing my subscription when it ends .
0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
0	i liked time magazine a lot until they named george bush person of the year ? oh my god , where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article
1	i 've been a subscriber since right before the days of bel ami . i 've never regretted a single issue , nor the investment .
1	i love travel mags , and this one is like the magazine adventure , but adds more of a tourist bent without losing the original edginess that is adventure writing
1	this is simply a beautiful magazine , printed on heavy , glossy paper . its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods , wines , and the countries from which they originate . it is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow , it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries , their food and wine , their restaurants , and their culture . usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about . the articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information . i am a tea lover , and i love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones , dainty sandwiches , and light cakes . so , i particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea . it transported the reader to devon , england with its afternoon tradition of tea and scones , accompanied by clotted cream and jam , which is often referred to as a cream tea . of course , a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea . this , too , is discussed in the article . photographs of an authentic village tearoom in devon were included , as well as recipes for making scones , tea sandwiches , black currant jam , strawberry jam , and victoria sponge cake . the article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made . it interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream . a guide was included for devon in terms of where to stay , where to eat , and where to go for tea . the article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences , detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea , a cream tea , and a high tea , and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each . i so enjoyed this article ! even if i never physically go to devon , i feel as if the magazine had transported me there , as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand . the magazine has these types of articles in every issue , covering regions from all over the world , including those in the united states . the magazine also contains a helpful section titled , `` the pantry '' , which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine . this makes it invariably easier for the reader , who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes , to find what one needs . it is little wonder that i love this magazine . those who are interested in wonderful food , excellent and easy to follow recipes , other cultures and customs , as well as traveling , will simple adore this magazine . it makes a wonderful gift . i know , because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which i am grateful , as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again , each and every month .
0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided , why not ? ? its been a year and , although the previews of each week 's prime-time programs are fun ( 2 pages worth ) i was very dissapointed . the articles are empty , boring and some downright retarded ; rehashing show 's dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around . i realize this is an entertainment magazine , but still , the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide - much more interestin
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips , activities , posters , etc . however , i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance . this continues though i asked them to stop . for the last three or four weeks , they 've been calling me on the telephone every day . this continues though i asked them to stop . the few good ideas in each $ 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment
1	this is the magazine for windows it pros . i have been a reader of this magazine since it first appeared at windows nt magazine . over time it has gotten thinner , but the articles are as informative as ever .
0	do n't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine at the newstand . trust me ... there will be no worthwhile patterns ( i mean ... just look at what they choose to grace their cover ! ! ! ) i have stopped hoping for even a half-way decent pattern to come along during the two years or so . i have seen litteraly only one knittable pattern in the last three years ( december 2004 i believe it was ... a lace cardigan with beaded trim ) . even the articles are pointless . save your time and money and get a subscription to interweave knits or vogue knitting . or opt for a new magazine ( not available at all newstands in the us ) called simply knitting , which is imported from the uk . it amazes me that this magazine is even still in production with how horible it is ! !
0	admittedly , i am slightly older than the `` relevant '' demographic . but i 'm not 40 yet ! so there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me . and i applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues . still , the magazine suffers from it 's unrelenting fawning over the whole post-modern vibe and it 's own sense of self-importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness . ( `` hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks have ipods too ! '' ) usually , the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance , the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant . so , like it 's spiritual cousin `` charisma , '' this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture . it trumpets its ability to ask `` the tough questions , '' even as it follows a relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea of being cutting edge was to put bono on the cover . if you want to be cutting edge , put the libertine adam clayton on the cover and ask him about bono 's faith . now , i would read that article ! ( i am a major u2 and bono fan . i 'm not knocking him ; just the lack of imagination at `` relevant '' . ) there 's also way too much emulation of the world 's perspective on generational heritage . `` hey , we 're young , and we 're smart , and we do n't need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it . '' i guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles does n't cut it in today 's paris hilton culture , but i 'd like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values . actually , `` relevant '' seems to be a little afraid to say what `` biblical values '' are ( beyond the obvious politically expedient ones ) ; it all seems amorphous here . i 've never been a fan of the whole `` what 's hot/what 's not '' ethos . and , i 'd like to give a little more respect to today 's christian young people to think they could handle something that did n't fall into that same faddish trap . i am hopeful that they may get it right yet with `` relevant '' . at times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than a slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization of youth , culture icon quotations , and psycobabble `` cool dude '' theological lingo to make one relevant
1	this magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind . i have developed some serious guts in fighting for what i am worth due to this publication . when you are a new designer , you get taken advantage of frequently . college did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market , and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm , but also serves as a gutsy , motivational read as well . this is a must have subscription for budding designers . what a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest

1	as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine . i think it 's totally hot . i really like the fiction , and the guys are such cute young hotties ! some of them look a little `` mean '' for my taste - they look so challengingly at you , instead of invitingly , but then again , a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn i guess . very few , if any of them are over-beefed ( too muscular ) , and some of them are n't muscular at all , which means nice variety . the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i 've looked at - lots of first times , nothing really bizarre or violent . overall a cool magazine
1	i began reading the green guide about a year ago and it 's one of the best resources out there . they cover a wide variety of topics and offer actual steps you can take towards a `` greener , '' healthier life . one of my favorite issues is the one about which ingredients to avoid in cosmetics . also , i just bought a house and their issue one eco-renovation is extremely helpful . not only do they tell you which products are safest , but they also list places where you can actually purchase them ! their website , [ . . . ] also has a ton of great information , including charts on which fish , beef , chicken and eggs are safest to buy . i printed them out and carry them with me whenever i go to the supermarket or restaurants
1	i love the city . its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world . 'new york magazine ' captures some of this , and works to be fashionable and fast , glossy and up-to- date , stylish and hip ( if that is still the word . ) i sort of like some of this , but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic . and a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league . but 'new york ' often has wonderful writing . i cite here james atlas as a particularly good contributor . and it tells you things about the city no other magazine does . some of those things old conservative me will not read . but at times there are pieces here that can not only be 'fun ' but give a real feeling why the big apple is still the 'empire state building ( or flatiron building ) of all the great cities
1	i was sceptical at first . but after getting a few of the magazines i really got into the way they looked at the whole body health and did n't just focus on `` body '' exercises like most magazines
1	i have subscriptions to a few magazines , and i have to say , seventeen , is the one i 'm always looking forward to . this magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips , how to be healthy ( not just stick thin ! ) , tips for school , fun ( not very useful , but fun ) stuff on guys and love , teen stories , and important information to be aware of . it 's fun , but also informing . the models are normal girls , and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear , but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who 's size 4 , 8 , or 16 . many styles from girly to goth are shown , not just one . the clothing and accessories are also affordable , and can be found at stores in your nearby mall . seventeen is n't all fashion . it 's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life . it 's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are , and not what you are n't . i 've used some of the tips on health , skin care , feeling good , and make-up , and you know what ? they do work , and are actually helpful ( ***gasp*** ) . the celebrity interviews are very good , and such that you can relate to them . the stories about things in teens ' lives are also very good- some are sad , but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there . it 's a wonderful magazine . it does n't have an overload of ads like teen vogue or elle girl , while still including fashion ( though i will say not as much as these two mags , because these two are almost entirely all how to look good ) . seventeen however , has a bit more fashion than teen people , teen people having more stories and such ( though it is right up there with seventeen ) . seventeen is a happy medium . it 's an awesome magazine
0	the editor 's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid lifestyle magazine , which you 'll enjoy only if you 're like her -- rich , creepily entitled , self-absorbed , and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining , but not really food or actual cooking itself .
0	i have to agree with those who did n't care for it . the only thing i liked was one article written by a dad who was skateboarding with his son . it was witty , insightful and inspirational . the rest of the mag just seemed totally irrelevent to my life . it is aimed at people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . does anyone do that ? i do n't want my kids to be that concerned with clothes and money . the few issues i read made me mad and depressed . i 've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so regarding this lame magazine . give me break with that $ 400 cashmere hoodie for my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts and that is what matters . he is not a reflection of my style , he is a reflection of his own . get over yourselves
0	why ? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it has nothing to do with natural health . it has to do with advertisements . it is empty , completelly . more : it looks like a woman magazine but i believe that a clever woman would feel like i feel now , angry ! i paid for something that i believed but it is not . ok , we make mistakes
0	unfortunately , i have not received the item . it 's been 4.5 weeks since i placed the order . i am reviewing this a low star , it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription
1	i have been a reader fan of dog world since i had my first dogs in 1981 . being an avid dog-lover since childhood , i have always enjoyed the breeder ads discovering breeds new to me . these days one of my favorite sections is the `` rare breeds '' . i thoroughly enjoy the bi-annual `` all breed '' special issue . although each issue does profile a breed of dog , what i like better than dog fancy is that the profiles are more informative in-depth . dog world also covers rare breeds in their profiles , not just akc breeds . i would recommend dog world for dog professionals avid dog-lovers involved in dog sports ; and dog fancy for the more casual dog people
1	i love this magazine and have just ordered a subscription for my daughter too . very good value for the money
0	i am also a longtime subscriber , and i am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine . i have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances , if you will ( i would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am a current subscriber , and was quite suprised by discover 's new look ( to all reading this review on amazon.com : amazon.com does not display the updated version of what discover currently looks like ) . i did n't quite care for it , but as long as the material stayed the same i was going to be allright with it . unfortunately , the articles in discover have degenerated into `` top 20 things you did n't know about ... '' lists , piles of trivia , some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news . sure , reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous . is it appropriate for what discover stood for or what i have expected from this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there is an intelligent article . the cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the old discover . i really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox . i 've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition i possibly could because i truly did enjoy reading them , and still do . maybe this new discover is for a `` new generation '' or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers , but i think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse . i think the ordinary person , the `` lay man '' if you will , would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new , interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community . i remember the string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.it was very exciting , and most importantly it [ i ] got me interested in the science [ /i ] . i doubt i will ever see anything that good from discover magazine again . i 'd really hate to give up on this magazine : all i ask is for the old discover back .
1	i have been reading the ny times book review for many many years . there rarely is a week when there is not some review of considerable interest to me . though i oppose its political bias which is left liberal , i appreciate the solidity , and respectful way in which most reviews are written . there is a sense that for the times books and culture in general have meaning and importance . the 'times ' tends to bet for its main articles on proven winners . a review in the times can make a person 's name , and many many are the writers whose books have arrived in the 'times ' offices never to be given a real look at . the 'times ' articles and reviews are not the longest and the deepest but they do often provide pleasant reads , and arouse real interest in the book in question . the ny times book review is still of first importance because the ny times is . i still try to skim through every week searching for the review or two that i really have to try to chew and digest .
0	i don`t like this magazine . it is so boring . the gossip is lame and dry , and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say ¨omg , another hd poster for my room ! ! ¨ there`s hardly any real pages , just regular old posters . teens , beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored . this is a magazine for girls aged 9-12 . strictly for tweens
1	i can not believe amazon is selling this mag ! what next ... falcon videos in k-mart ? i mean , i am so not complaining ! these boys are bitchin ' ! you will not regret this purchase , i so promise
1	entertainment weekly really understands the whole arena of entertainment from film to television to dvd to music to games to even hand-held media for your phone like downloads , mobile ringtones and even book reviews . plus you can search the archives of entertainment weekly for almost any article ranging in categories from pop culture to photo galleries , to their annual lists which include such top ten lists as the hottest american idol performances ever , most memorable gay couples even before brokeback mountain to the most embarrassing sex scenes in the movies . the magazine has been publishing since 1990 so it has chronicled the rise of the star director , star writer , star-producer and the hyphenates -- actor/producers , actor/directors , actor/writers etc . and it 's seen the rise of hollywood usa and hollywood world where popular culture seems to impact every aspect of our lives from how we live to the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the cars we drive . do n't miss their lists -- who 's who in various categories like the `` it list '' to the `` power list '' to the `` entertainers of the year '' .
1	my initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge , and full of ads . i also read vogue , though , and to be honest , w has less ads in it . w convieniently avoids the snotty air of harper 's bazaar and vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in cosmopolitan , redbook , and marie claire , and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of instyle . this magazine has excellent layouts , and from what i 've read thus far , excellent-and very different-stories . as a regular vogue reader , i 'm used to reading about older designers like coco chanel , the versace and prada lines , and reading about a small smattering of socialites , like aerin lauder , paris hilton , jemma kidd , victoria traina . what is different about w is that it profiles the new and the modern . an article in the september issue profiled kate spade and her new line . other articles talked , almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites , meanwhile talking about , in an article aptly titled `` a bag called it '' the trend of statement purses and their proper place . w is also similar to vogue that in addition to the good layouts , it has even better photography , there are no photoshopped to death photos in here , and if they are , this student ca n't find them . what i like most about w is its sarcastic wit , something that is lost in most magazines , many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man , worship teri hatcher , or read dumbed down articles .
0	if you do n't tend to care about writing , then this would be the magazine for you . save your pennies and indulge on something else maybe
0	about two years ago , vanity fair was not only the best magazine of the year , but maybe all time . i would read it from cover to cover . now , sadly , it is a bunch of fluff . the quality has really gone downhill . i am going to let my subscription run out . i really miss the old days
0	would love to review but have not received anything yet ! what 's up wit dat ?
1	`` time '' is a fascinating magazine to read . it provides insightful and enlightening news most of the time . the magazine provides more balanced reporting than say newsweek . i find its coverage of the wide range of issues it covers including politics , the arts , business and lifestyle , and many other areas to be interesting and enlightening . so for those looking for a weekly that is largely educative on developments worldwide , then time magazine should do . to those already subscribing for the magazine , congratulations for making a good choice .
1	this is a wonderful mag . more things should be literary yet down to earth like this journal . without a doubt this is one of the best places to find great fiction and poetry
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies . instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors . if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler ... this is not the mag for you .
0	the magazines ordered through amazon take an eternity to be delivered . the estimated time for my delivery was april after i had placed the order in feb. that 's a long enough wait as it is -- -i ended up receiving it the the end of june ! and when i called to complain ... the customer service rep explained to me that it was technically within the estimated allowed time for delivery . so bottom line ... if you have an urge to order a magazine that may take half a year or so to get to you ... then this is the one for you-hands down . i plan on never ordering a single magazine through amazon again . definitely do n't send a subscription to anyone as a birthday gift- it 'll maybe make it in time for the following birthday year..so plan years in advance
0	as a member of a southern family who treasured this magazine , it is with a heavy heart and a sense of loss that i have decided not to renew my subscription this year . yes , i 've always given the brides in our family a subscription as a gift , and waited eagerly for my issue to come in the mail . but those days are past . southern living magazine has been offered to all states for some time now , and i believe this has caused the editors to try to appeal to a broader readership . this , in turn , has changed the recipe section into something one can find in any other magazine . honestly , i do love all sorts of different cuisines , but in a magazine called `` southern living '' , i expect to find wonderful and traditional southern recipes ! this magazine needs to go back to it 's roots . from now on , i 'll be giving new brides a subscription to southern lady magazine , and that 's what i 'll be reading myself ! i will miss the christmas book , though .
0	i would agree with previous reviewers , in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read . the number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles . it is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads ( possibly 50 % or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such as viking ranges , bmw 's , oceanna cruises , trips to bora bora ... wtf ? although i do enjoy i a luxury meal , i do n't want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling . ocassionally , behind the clutter , i find a useful recipe ; i rarely find an interesting article . i am going to let my subscription expire at the end of the current period
1	if i had to pick just one women 's magazine to subscribe to , `` good housekeeping '' would be the one . it has many of the same articles that all women 's magazines have : articles on health , fitness , finance , relationships , diet , beauty , and fashion . but `` good housekeeping '' goes beyond the surface in these articles , for example , their fashion articles do n't focus just on high-priced clothing , instead they show outfits that look like their expensive counterparts that readers can buy for just a fraction of the cost . there are also advice columnists on things like household hints , etiquette , and relationships . each issue also has a short story . there 's also the seemingly obligatory celebrity on the cover and interview inside each issue . what i like about `` good housekeeping '' are the in-depth articles . most magazines today publish articles that are only a page or so long , but many articles in `` good housekeeping '' are several pages long . the articles are often about ordinary people making a difference in the world . there are usually cautionary articles for parents with young children and/or teenagers that can be frightening ( a recent article was about a sexually abusive male babysitter ) but very useful . as with many magazines , good housekeeping also has an on-line counterpart , where readers can post messages about current issues as well as enter contests . well worth subscribing to .
0	this publication has no business calling itself a `` magazine '' ; published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies , this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo . do n't waste your money

0	i was one of entertainment weekly 's charter subscribers way back in 1990 . it started out great -- a different , intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage . but financially , things were shaky , so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience . i could n't blame the editors . it helped them reach the needed tipping point , and they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus , and i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew has fallen off a cliff . it has become entirely superficial and shallow , with hardly any substance at all . the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format . i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience . so , i 've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be
0	i had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until i bought one from our local super market . i was surprised at the difference that i had already paid to order from amazon and what it was there . i canceled my order and ordered from them . some items are much less on amazon and some are much more . you just have to be careful . a magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from .
1	this magazine is great for beginning to intermediate digital camera users . i think that it is especially great for beginners . there are articles about how to choose the right camera for your purpose and about what all the specifications mean . there are question and answer sections that answer a broad range of questions including how to avoid common computer errors and how to format different digital devices . i like the photo editing tips , which explain some of the more elusive aspects of most digital photo editing programs and how to use them . the photo-editing program described most often is adobe photoshop and photoshop elements ; however , quick advice is also give about how to apply these tips to other programs . for more advanced film camera users , there are tips for how to make the same quality image with a digital camera and stories of professional photographers who have switched to digital . however , most professional photographers will use macs to edit their photos rather than pcs and more advanced photo editing software . mostly this magazine caters to amateur photographers and the lower end photo-editing programs that are most often used . there are also reviews of new gadgets , which are often fun to read , and plenty of market place like advertising in the back . this magazine is what it advertises and nothing more
0	i have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and i have become very skeptical of much of its advice . this advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g . the us dairy industry ( there is always at least one of those annoying `` got milk '' ads ) and not surprisingly , every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products ( e.g . milk and cheese ) . however having read many books on nutrition , it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the the china study by colin campbell , an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the us dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public 's perception of the healthfulness of its products . it is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers ' paychecks . the magazine also appears to be very similar to prevention magazine which i also have subscribed to and i would make the same criticism of . my advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent `` berkeley wellness letter '' that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the us dairy industry
1	finally a magazine for women of color . a magazine that instructs anyone step by step how to achieve a particular look
0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count , and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits , measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues . and yet our patronage here is very conservative . perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all , or maybe , as a couple of reviewers suggested , with bill clinton out of office , it no longer has the same appeal . you can change my rating to five stars if you like , for the sake of ideology , but you still wo n't read the thing . just like i do n't read the nation anymore
1	before buying a subscription to this magazine i would suggest reading through an issue first , just so you are aware of what you 'll be getting . no , it 's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking , and the articles are n't scholarly or journal-worthy . but.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader , and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting . i am always engaged reading the articles , and find them topical and very current , unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep ' and drenched in older principles . this is a very `hip ' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more . my favorite part is looking through the recommended books section , because there is usually something worthwhile to read
1	i have to admit i enjoy reading about woodworking almost as much as doing it - just remember i did say `` almost '' ! this magazine is among my top five favorite magazines on the topic and i have to say that i enjoy it greatly . the articles are well written and the photography is very good , which when combined equates to my clear understanding of their project plans , etc . this is of course crucial for any how-to magazine and there are few disappointments here . i find that there is almost always one project in every issue that i make plans to build `` someday '' . though i do n't get to all of them , it is nice to have so many projects to choose from ! i also really appreciate the tool reviews . between popular woodworking and my other four favorites ( fine woodworking , wood , american woodworker , and workbench ) nearly every type of woodworking tool is reviewed at least once every 18 months . overall , this is a solid magazine with good content and a clear purpose and i feel it is well worth the money .
0	anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine , as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed , are often given bad reviews . its all pretentious pop-culture drivel for the conformist , weak-willed mainstream american . the worst part of rolling stone is the 100 greatest guitarists of all time list ; as they highly rate kirk hammett , kurt cobain , and tom morello ( all extremely overrated guitarists ) while rating eddie van halen at a very lowly # 70 and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists ; kerry king/jeff hanneman ( slayer ) , john petrucci ( dream theater ) , trey azagthoth/erik rutan ( morbid angel ) , jeff loomis ( nevermore ) , steve vai , and joe satriani . if you know anything about good guitarists , those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk , kurt , and tom . do n't read this if you 're trying to decide what good music is , you decide what good music is . think for yourself , do n't let mtv and rolling stone think for you
1	ok , so there are n't as many ads ( which incidentally helps its portability ) , but i 've been reading computer shopper for 6 years now , and i still find it a great read and a very valuable resource . i read every issue not only for its usefulness , but also for entertainment value - i guess you can call me a tech geek ! it 's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear - i particularly like the alfred poor 's computer cures articles and how-to guides for us `` do-it-yourselfers '' . its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative . over the past few years , i have bought several computer systems for myself and family members , thanks to advice from the experts at computer shopper and their recommendations on where to buy . so , even though i do miss the `` tech-mall '' feel of the old magazine , i 'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology
0	i loved this magazine in 1995 , until a few years ago . they have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads . no new information . glossy pics of models with bright red lips . what is about health here ? get life extension magazine and alternative medicine magazine . they 've changed too over the last few years , but still a far sight better than this one
1	i used to dream about subscribing to threads and drool over them in the library , but the new format beginning in fall 2005 is disappointing . they have added many more articles of interest to very new sewers such as how to choose the correct needle for a fabric . this basic info is readily available in many basic sewing books and it is not why i renewed to threads for another 3 years . this magazine once showed cutting edge techniques and lots of projects that intermediate and advanced sewers could savor . as a beginning sewer i used to dream about conquering the exciting projects in threads . now , they have watered it down to appeal to less skilled people at the expense of the projects and information that made it stand out from other sewing magazines . this is still a `` good '' magazine , but no longer excellent . i wish that i could get back my money for the next 3 years and spend it on fabric
0	this magazine should really be titled `` better living through buying stuff . '' it 's beautifully designed but during the course of my subscription , the only important thing i 've learned is how to fold a sweater . i will not be renewing
0	i began subscribing to gourmet in 1961 , and continued to subscribe for about forty years . i also gifted family members with subscriprions . i discontinued my subscription because the magazine has deteriorated so much in the last several years : there are so many ads and tear-outs in the magazine that one can hardly find the recipes , at least half of the magazine , and sometimes more ; also i object to the `` political , '' and some downright offensive , articles . i am catholic , and i was very offended by an outrageous article charging that , during the nazi era , naked jews were made to crawl through the streets on their knees by persons , which the article linked in some way to the catholic church . i think that the information was apochryphal ; and , what does this have to do with food ?
0	my dad bought this magazine for my mom and i usually pick up the copies to browse them . that is all both my mom in her fifties and i in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke . it is not that special it is chucked full of ads . the cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information . i find this magazine a waste of our money . it will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription . my mom has already stated that .
0	i am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material , 'wired ' is even too tedious to fill that need . its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled national geographics of questionable scientific value . on the other hand the articles , for example in the latest issue , 'are higher gas prices good for us ' ( paraphrase of title ) offer little information and if i had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced operation independance . the intention at the time was to free the u.s. from dependance on foriegn oil . oh we of short memory , condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters ! of interest may be the dumb means by which i obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines , playstation magazine - now x box magazine , the completely amoral men 's health , garden club , cooking . i simply check the highest income level on every form i fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application . typical of something recieved for nothing wired is not a publication for which i would recommend laying out any money or time . including bathroom time .
0	i got a free one year sub . to another gaming mag . with purchase of a game at gamestop . after it ended , about 6 months later , i started receiving this magazine , and i thought it was the same one , some kind of mix-up . but i did n't get a magazine every month . it skipped a few . finally i went on their site to complain , and they promised to send extra issues to make up for it . i told them that there must have been a mixup ... then i cancelled my supposed `` subscription '' , only to receive an e-mail saying that now they would n't be sending me anything , even the extra issues promised . stay away from these people ! these people are extremely unprofessional . try playstation mag instead if you have a ps - i was just reccommended it
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it . all i can say is the amazom service is terrible
0	i had hopes that this magazine would be a nice alternative to the others out there . from the moment i opened it , it felt so smug . i gave it a chance and read it cover to cover ( the april issue ) . but what finally did me in ( after having read that i could buy an $ 800 blouse to make me feel pretty in that after pregnancy stage , that i could match my children 's shoes to my jimmy choo 's and finally that i could buy my child the latest $ 300 tricycle ) was the article entitled `` normal '' about a child who was misdiagnosed with autism . the article discussed how distraught the mother was after her child was diagnosed with autism to the point that she tried to committ suicide . the article ended with the fact that the child turned out to be a genius . what was the point of this article ? to say thank god it was n't true ? what about those parents out there who have an autistic child , how does this article make them feel ? the article was painful and insensitive . there are better ways to spend you $ 10 than on cookie
1	if you like young , taut , masculine flesh displayed at its most inviting , you 'll love this magazine . supple , nubile youths ( over 18 of course ) parade their wares , front and back , and look longingly into the camera . consistently fine photography makes this magazine first choice for those with a taste for the younger gents..
1	i have many men magazine , none comes close to men 's health . some magazines are too glossy that spell `` expensive '' for what ever they wanted to promote . with men 's health , i get to everything from a to z. i always pass my old copies to my local library for their own collection
0	i was a subscriber to the new republic for several years , but in the waning years of the clinton administration and the beginnings of the bush ii administration , the paper seemed to take a real rightward turn . now , i have no problem with so-called liberal hawks , but the magazine 's slavish support for the war in iraq in the face of questionable evidence did it for me . in addition , the magazine spends more time bashing democrats for not aligning themselves with the magazine 's professed centrist/liberal slant than it does with presenting true progressives ideals that create thoughtful discourse among its readers . the magazine has forgotten its roots of progressive intellectualism and dissent in favor of safe , `` new democrat '' rhetoric . there are better magazines our there
1	i have given this as a gift to both my husband and father-in-law . they are both very handy and own older homes . it is perfect . i even enjoy reading my husbands for organizational tips
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time . if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator , readsomething else
0	i received this subscription as a trial , and found it one of the most boring publications that i have ever read . by the last few issues that i got , i was n't even looking at the pictures anymore . there are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life , which were very materialistic . at the end of every issue there were pictures of real-life wedding announcements . perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper , but it struck me as out of place in a magazine
1	my 4 year old , according to my wife , ca n't put this one down . ever since the stories started coming , it has been non stop reading . this is the type of books that i want for my children
0	we paid for a 12 month subscription and i got the magazine for about 4 months . i could n't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money . i did n't get a 12 month subscription . i got ripped off . plus when i did get the issues they are very poor paper quality and the covers and some of the pages were always ripped and bent up . very disapointing ...
1	i love instyle . i can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of instyle . it is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic , timeless fashion . it shows what is hot , how to put outfits together , who wears what , and it does n't try to dabble in other areas . it sticks to fashion and i like that . that is why i subscribe to it and probably always will . the best out there . much better than elle and likely even better than vogue . i love it
1	this is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design , advertising , illustration or photograhy . it digs deep into industry trends , features portfolios of upcoming industry stars , and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously . while the issues are great , their regional design annual is the must-buy issue every year . it really lets you know who the cream of the crop are . just flipping through it will make you better at what you do ( and you 'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like `` cream of the crop '' )
1	this is a fun read . the articles are entertaining and short . good to pass some time . excellent for the plane !
1	i do n't know how to get in touch with the magazine express inc. people , but i 'd have a serious lecture for them about poor delivery . i always get my magazine about a month late ( yes after it 's been on newstands for that long ) and that 's if i recieve it at all . if you move during the middle of your subscription , you 're screwed . it took months to get them to forward them correctly to my new address and in the meantime , the few i missed were just lost . when you 're paying upwards of $ 100 for a subscription and only get 10 a year ( french vogue only produces 10 issues ) , but 3 are lost in the mail , you lose 30 percent or your money . bum deal
1	my students love getting a chance to read on current topics they are interested in
0	ordered 11/27 - never received a single copy . not very fast is it ? slow company may be a better description . can i have my money back
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
0	after reading the reviews and description , i have ordered intermezzo for a relative for two years . they were too polite to tell me that they have only received four magazines ( one a duplicate ) in that time period and have n't been able to get the magazine 's customer service to correct the problem . it does n't feel good to give a gift that ends up being a pain to the recipient and they still do n't have it . take a pass
1	great magazine . this is not my typical type of read , because i 've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi-media . but the great thing about this magazine is that you do n't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos . it tells you about them in simple terms too , no high-tech vocabulary needed . i feel informed whenever i read my monthly subscription , of the better products to purchase , as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies
0	i ordered this magazine thru amazon three months ago , and still have n't received a single issue . i 've emailed their subscription department to no avail . they have my money , but i do n't have a magazine
1	this is by far my favorite magazine . the pictures are excellent , the articles are informative and hilarious , it gives information on movies years in advance and the reviews are reliable . the best part about this magazine however is that every time i look through it i find something new
0	i ordered hamptons magazine through amazon.com back in october 2004 . i am still waiting for my first issue to arrive .
1	though not bleeding edge , ca gives a good overview of what 's happening in the field now . only complaint is that the annuals sometimes seem to be in a rut with similar or same folks featured again and again
1	i just wrote a review for opm , and had forgotten about this magazine . i also used to subscribe , and had recently let my subscription run out . i will not say it is not because i do not like this magazine , but because i am trying to save some money . but the fact is , that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market . the reviews are smart and fresh , never hackneyed , or cliched , the way a lot of other magazines are ( and some of my reviews , sorry guys ! ) . but the introductory article in each and every magazine , by the chief editor , always sounds like it has been written by a harvard grad , with a layman 's ability to make everything easy to understand . he has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together . never biased , they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews . i would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine , and like somebody else mentioned , better to go directly to the store , and get the discount card . after $ 150 - $ 200 in used game purchases , it pays for itself . highly recommend ! mc white said : if you 're a gamer , than you got ta have this magazine ! edit : believe it or not , when i got home , yesterday , just after writing this review , i had a copy of the september issue in my mailbox . i had forgotten , i had called customer service about a missed issue . they were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge , to cover my missed issue . i was quite impressed , and tickled pink , when i got my newest copy in the mail , when i arrived at my posh homestead . thank you game informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine .
0	i started reciving vibe magazine in the mail announced and unexpected . this would n't be the first time this happened , turns out my grandmother bought me people magazine as a gift and the copies were sent to my house . i figured that somebody had got me this magazine as a gift . next thing i know a charge for the magazine appears on my bank statement . i called vibe immediately and asked them what had happened . they told me that there was nothing they could do and that their company did n't directly deal with the payment issues and subscription services . they gave me a toll free number that i was too call from an outside company that handled the payments . when i called this company , it was completely automated service , could not speak with an actual person regardless of what extension i used . i eventually had to go down to my bank and find out what i could do . turns out vibe had illegally gained my bank account number and had been charging me for months , but i had only just recently started to recieve the magazine . i had to close down my checking account and open up a new one , which resulted in me being charged by my gym and other other companies that had access to my account in order to subtract monthly bills . it was as if i had written them a bad check , something that i had never done in my life and now greatly questioned my credibility . please do not support these people , they are theives and on top of that the magazine is terrible and uncredible . i seriously hope that my review will help deter any and all people from subscribing to this magazine
1	effective with the november , 2004 issue , gramophone has undergone a number of changes in design and editorial content , all for the better . one of these changes , perhaps the most minor of all , is the reversion to its original title , 'the ' gramophone . the other changes are more substantial , hardly cosmetic , especially for north american readers . one of the more notable new features is an article devoted to `` the event '' ( great musical events in history ) . for my money , gramophone could hardly have done better than to feature the september 12 , 1910 premire performance of gustav mahler 's 8th symphony ( `` the symphony of a thousand , '' according to emil guttmann , the promoter engaged by mahler for the premire ) . if i had just *one* performance to pick , were i able to turn the clock back , it would unquestionably have been this one . the anonymous writer has done a competent and reasonably accurate and complete job recapturing the excitement of an event which was talked about for decades afterward by those who were there . another new feature is titled `` the experts ' expert , '' in which well-known musicians of today talk about their own historical favorites for their instrument ( s ) . for the november , 2004 issue , several famous violinists ( plus lara st. john , who falls into a different category entirely ) praise their personal heroes . while not unanimous , it is telling that anne-sophie mutter , sarah chang , julia fischer and two others identify david oistrakh as their personal inspiration . still a third new feature , `` gramophone classics , '' is a roundtable discussion of historic performances ( one each month ) by the gramophone reviewers . for this kick-off month , the historic performance is that of the complete cycle of dvorak symphonies by the late istvn kertsz and the london symphony orchestra . now nearly forty years old , this is a boxed set of the cycle that i had favorably reviewed myself , quite some time back . ( interestingly , a nice photograph of kertsz conducting the lso shows that [ at least ] the principal flutist was playing a wooden flute , an advantage usually conceded to czech musicians over their counterparts elsewhere in performing dvorak 's symphonies . ) the balance of gramophone , aside from minor cosmetic layout changes , is pretty much as it had been in recent years . there is the usual north american supplement/insert , covering events , performers and releases specific to this market ; this is the version american subscribers receive and which is available in american book and magazine stores . the monthly reviews section is always of interest because it includes reviews of releases often available in the u.k. ( and the continent ) before they are available domestically . there is the obligatory `` free '' cd that includes excerpts from the editors ' choice of best discs of the month ( something which i tend to ignore , if only because excerpts can only give an incomplete picture of matters ) . and , finally , always of interest to this semi-gearhead are the audio equipment reviews , if only to point out the differences between american and british gearheads . : - ) the main purpose of such a publication is , of course , to provide critical commentary on new classical music releases . in this respect , i find the u.s.-published fanfare to be a more reliable source of information than the u.k.-published gramophone . chalk it up to `` across the pond '' differences in both repertoire and opinion , if you like . nevertheless , the improvements that take us from `` gramophone '' to `` the gramophone '' are enough for me to bump what might have been a 3-star review to one that is a solid 4 stars . bob zeidle
0	i 've subscribed to self on-and-off for about 15 years , but have recently been feeling like i 've outgrown the magazine . the articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers . fine , but not for me anymore ! also , their subscription department is terrible ! my most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues , double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that ca n't quite pull themselves together .
0	was n't worth the subscription . i found the magazine to be bland , full of ads and basically boring . all the information can be found doing a quick web search . highly disappointed
1	should you try out the hotel hot tub while on vacation or try the pool instead ? this magazine has excellent advice for everything from travel concerns to fitness and beauty advice . recipes for natural salt scrubs with buttermilk mingle with the hottest advice on commercial beauty products . do the new stick-on manicures work ? what is the newest information on cancer prevention ? dr. andrew weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why wild alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful . is the air in your home as clean as it could be ? fun product pages offer seasonal comforts . for summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans . special sections show you how to lose weight , even when on vacation . interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin . the only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which i read , but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt . if someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction , they probably are . i 'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations , although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations . ~the rebecca review
0	have not received the produst yet- be prepared to wait a long time for gardens illustrade
1	this is a decent magazine and it 's good to support an unabashed christian magazine . but if sojourners ~sometimes~ errors to the left- christianity ~often/ persistently~ errors to the the `` right . '' i subscribe to both , and if i find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long , i dig back deeper into the bible and then come out in the right place . contributor yancey is an inspiration and a true christian voice ; while colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of ct
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies . instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors . if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler ... this is not the mag for you .
1	`` creativity is like life insurance . if you are creative , you are never afraid , because you can design yourself out of any situation . '' ~li edelkoort if you are interested in items like the nissan actic concept car ( that has a matching trailer ) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom , kitchen or garden , this magazine delivers . dwell has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef . for example , the april/may 2004 issue had articles on : home cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home . cutting it up - a downtown los angeles loft gets a makeover . stainless chef - designer john picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub . victorian revival - a san franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations . trend diva - jane szita talks about nesting and nihilism . other interesting articles include information on houses that become art , short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space . i was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or cd changers which are most modern . well , until i can afford a 9,500 buck oven , i 'll keep reading and dreaming . the library in the april/may issue is to die for ! big windows and shelves galore . dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did ! even some of the text is in color . the marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design , house or otherwise . the sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources . ~the rebecca review
1	i read scientific american occassionally back in the 80 's . at that time i found the articles ( especially the physics articles , which i love ) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics . the quality was there but it did n't quite get across to my younger self . now , i find the text to be very good and superbly well-supported by side matter and graphics . i would call this an improvement ( both in the magazine and , perhaps , in myself ) . however , i did n't read it regularly back then , so perhaps the negative reviewers are correct in saying the magazine has been `` dumbed down '' . if so , then it was from a very lofty level as the articles continue to require a reasonable background in their subject areas . for example , the article `` computing with quantum knots '' was just right for somebody who has read a number of non-mathematical treatments of this topic and who , like me , has read parts of the feynman lectures and things of that nature . it was a sophisticated and intelligent article . there are many more examples i could give . my only gripe with scientific american ( and this has been true for decades ) is that i just do n't like medical articles and the magazine regulary has them . this , however , is a personal matter and reflects my interests not the quality of the magazine . i strongly suspect the `` format was changed '' , as some said , because the publisher wanted to improve it for everybody and catch a few more readers . certainly , i would not have subscribed to the old scientific american . it was too dense and too boring . now it is just about right for me . but that 's me . your mileage may vary
1	being a garden designer i read lots of gardening magazines but this has always been my favorite . it is loaded with design plans useful tips , etc . for the experienced gardener as well as the new to gardening gardener . along with beautiful garden photos is also the story behind the garden , the gardener , and even how long it takes from start to fruition . i look forward to each issue ... . i only wish it were monthly
1	excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare , in just 30 minutes . no need to be out of ideas for any party or get together , just open the book to any page , and you 're set and ready to go , or should i say cook !
1	their work out are very effective if you comply with the guideliness for each move and routine . i love it ! ! ! been a member for 2 years already
0	i purchaced this magazine thinking that it would be the next step from the amateur photo magazine level to the serious pro level . in fact , it is not really either .
1	i have subscribed to the all of the big car magazines for years , i am glad i stumbled upon sports car international in australia of all places . the articles are all well written and devoid of the mindless blather you find in most of the other rags . i enjoy that they only write about interesting cars , i do n't read car magazines to help me decide weather to buy the new camry or the accord , most of the other magazines cater to this crowd to one degree or another . the photography keeps me pacing in front of the mail box waiting for the next issue , the shots of the bugatti veyron on the salt flats were the latest ones to blow my mind . my only complaint is that the magazine is bi-monthly , i would gladly pay twice the money to receive it every month .
1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription . i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified . thanks so much
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband . it took 5 months to get the first magazine , then i never recieved another one
1	someone posted below that they do n't receive all their issues . i have never failed to receive an issue . i suspect someone is making off with this person 's copies . this is an elegant magazine , worthy of martha . if they cover a topic , you will know all there is to know about that topic . the recipes are little gems , and i like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved . it 's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world . i do miss martha 's column of reminiscences , and wish that was back in the magazine
1	lieven 's article , `` in the mirror of europe : the perils of american nationalism '' ; is succinct , cogent , and in my opinion frighteningly accurate . my experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance , whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11 , war on terrorism and god , which the majority of my students now accept as truth . i have one suggestion , i think mr. lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power . i feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch , much of the leadership of coporate america , an increasing number of jewish and christian denominations , much of the media-particularly am talk radio , higher education , the military , and with another four years of the current administration , federal courts at all levels . i will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups . i think the article was well-written and important , my congratulations to the author
1	american spectator mag . is an oasis of true conservatism in this jungle of liberalism ! mr. emitt tyrell has got to be the coolest guy to ever put together a magazine . the information is fantastic , the intellect captivating . i highly reccommend it to everyone
1	the magazine is based on the work of an actual test kitchen outside of boston , ma . it is thorough and focused and right on . i have also found it to be very impressive because it is printed on recycled paper and it is n't your typical publication with glossy paper and lots of photos . in fact , pictures that are found within its pages are drawn by staff members , thus `` illustrated '' . you 'd be surprised at how great it is . it leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia with every delivery . it is also written with great clarity . plus , you 'll find literal gifts to yourself in every issue , atypical of most others . there are , of course , terrific recipes . then you 'll find equipment ratings , taste tests and comparisons , suggestions for supplies , herbs and spices , specialty foods , tips and techniques , shortcuts , etc . one of my most favorite areas is the editorial from the publisher in the beginning of each issue . i love his down to earth , somewhat quirky style of writing as it is always interesting and always intelligent . if you go to their website , name of magazine , you 'll find good deals on subscriptions and they will send you a free issue . there is something for everyone here ... .the novice cook and the accomplished chef . highly recommended .
1	kiplinger 's personal finance is a worthy challenge to money magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends , helpful financial tips , and - in kpf 's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor . i came to kpf by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of kiplinger letters ( for which , see elsewhere on [ ... ] ) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago . she probably thought that without i 'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness , where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion . i eventually migrated up the kiplinger food chain to the glossier kpf and have never left . much of the information provided by kpf ( mutual fund and etf results and the liek ) are widely available . the same could be said of the investing advice ( look for no-loads with low fees , diversify , do n't bail under pressure ) . where kpf excels is in the short articles and tips , which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves . two fine recent examples : the articles in the september 2006 issue entitled 'buy a 2006 car on sale ? ' and '5 things to ask about silk ties ' . both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions i 'm likely to make in the new year . what 's more , the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you 'd anticipate . in terms of marco-economic instincts , the kiplinger washington editors run bullish , though not quite so much as money 's more cosmopolitan-posed writers . kpf wo n't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman 's toys either , a fact that is well observed by their authors , who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or german auto makers . do n't get me wrong , i read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about kpf if it were my only source . but kpf 's monthly arrival is still always welcomed , as it has been for years . it remains firmly entrenched in my top tier
0	nice cover pictures and headlines , but way too many ads . there 's a reason its only twelve bucks , this is an ad-sponsored mag
0	the weekly standard is just more of the same . it 's not , strictly speaking , journalism . but i imagine you 'd like it if you enjoy reading articles that set out to promote a very conservative point of view . if you like rush or fox news , you 'd probably like it . if you are looking for a serious media outlet , this is not it
0	change can be good ; however , sometimes change can be very bad . earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers . before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content ; now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time . as a longtime subscriber ( 20 years ) i will not be re-subscribing to the magazine . i wish them luck , but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them
1	small pieces on the entire world - past present and future . yum
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market . very realistic with budgets too . it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable ( on any budget ) . i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful
1	i received my first magazine , it is n't glossy or flashy , but is full of in-depth info , which is exactly what i wanted . not very thick for the money , but i 'm still satisfied due to the quality of the content .
0	when you watch commercial children 's television , you have to accept the commercials because , after all , the programs are `` free '' . but when you pay to subscribe to nickelodeon magazine , i do n't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children . these ads appear similar to the editorial content . it seems like 50 % of the pages are advertisements ! i was disappointed and wo n't be renewing our subscription . better to look at something from the highlights magazine series .
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips , activities , posters , etc . however , i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance . this continues though i asked them to stop . for the last three or four weeks , they 've been calling me on the telephone every day . this continues though i asked them to stop . the few good ideas in each $ 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment
1	i was annoyed that this magazine seems to equate `` mature woman '' with `` has kids '' . i enjoy the realistic fashion tips and advice , and i get annoyed with cosmo 's teenage attitude , but i 'd like to see more about careers to balance out the `` how to be a mom who does it all '' sections . and yes , i 'm not kidding ... there 's a regular section on being a mom who does it all . this mag will appeal to those who are in the mom/work category . those of us who do not have kids but are still `` grown up '' will be a little left behind
1	like my fellow choc-o-holic white brother , floyd 's garage , i too get weird and sometimes disgusted looks from some lame pastyfaced , flatbacked white girl at the counter . what i do when i put my `` black men '' or `` king '' magazine down on the counter is make comments like ... `` i love black women , '' `` black women are the best , '' or i might mention to those most obviously in the negative ... `` you wish you had some butt and hips like these girls , now ring me the f -- k up ! only thing i do not like about this rag is why use such an exclusionary name ? should oldfart and lame `` playboy '' or those mags out there which are in celebration of anorexia like `` stuff '' or `` fhm '' call themselves `` white men '' ? ! no ! of course not ! so let 's all just chill and enjoy these black beauties .
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift for my brother almost 5 months ago and he still has not received an issue . i can not get a straight answer from anyone about what is happening and i have not even been able to get my money back . i would not recommend anyone wasting their money with this magazine unless they can find a legitimate web site to get it from . kerr
1	i read the review marci carl about the jennifer chiaverini books the quilter'ed apprentice . i am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as i am your magazine . then i had to go get on the computor and found jennifer 's site . now i want to get back into quilting big time . my husband just rolls his eyes .
0	have n't received this item . it has been almost 2 months
0	i am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery , or lack thereof , of the magazine subscription i received as a gift of romantic homes . this is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year 's subcription for me from amazon.com for christmas 2005 ! i still have n't received one magazine ( it 's now july 2006 ) . amazon assured me three times , over the past year , it was coming , it 's now july and i still have n't received the magazine . i am so disappointed at the lack of customer service . i urge you to never buy a magazine subscription from amazon.com . this has been a horrible experience and i can not believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter . i am tired of empty promises from amazon.com while i am anxiously awaiting my magazine . not only have i not received my magazine , the `` people '' at amazon have never offered a refund , a renewed subscription , anything ! i realize it 's a measly twenty-something dollars , but this business practice is horrible ! i am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak english and are trying to help me . please do better amazon , this is terrible ! shame on you !
0	i am 14 . i used to read this about two and a half years ago . it was a pretty good magazine back then , with health tips , some real life stories , and even things like sex questions ( which is saying alot more than some of these other magazines . ) it was n't packed full of teenyboppers and cheesy glitter makeup . i liked it , and if it was still the way it was , i 'd probably still be reading it . but now , it 's gone . i read my last issue one year ago and gave it up . it got way to young for me . all they talk about is celebrities ( aka jojo , good charlotte , hilary duff , jesse mccartney , usher , etc . ) alright , two of them make some passable music , but what about the others ? they 're talentless ! plus , i do not see anything that would appeal to anyone over the age of 13 . they refer to guys as `` hotties '' and `` babes , '' and they just put the same person on every five pages ! there are stupid quizzes to tell you your kissing type or how psychic you are ( seriously . ) half the magazine is huge posters for your room of airbrushed teeneyboppers . if you want a magazine with real substance , try seventeen ( highly reccomended ) , cosmogirl , teen vogue , and maybe teen people ( i do n't know , it 's kind of lost its fun factor . ) some of these magazines may not be `` appropriate '' to the people that read this magazine , but i personally think it is better for young girls to learn the hard honest truth about the world than to be obsessed with pop stars and the latest mary-kate and ashley gossip .
0	i subscribe to parents , parenting and child magazine and will renew all but the one to child . it 's full of ridiculous fashion spreads ( like i 'm going to spend $ 50 on a t-shirt for my 15-month old ) , useless travel information and near-advertising features on the newest , most expensive items i 'need ' for my child . the actual articles are no better or worse than what 's in the other mags , and i do n't find there 's nearly as much information in the magazine as in the others . as other reviewers have said , it is beautiful . however , it 's thoroughly impractical unless you 're one of those people who plan to shop at neiman 's for your child ... not that there 's anything wrong with that
1	this is a great travel magazine - wonderful pictures and stories . it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel+leisure , so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal . be aware though , the items in this magazine are not very cheap , unfortunately . go with another magazine ( arthur frommer 's budget travel ) if you want to find travel baragains
1	scientific american mind shares all the fascinating news in brain/mind research in a realatively easy-to-understand writing sytle . the illustrations are excellent ... lucid and colorful .
1	print magazines are behind current news by about 3-4 months . the websites have news about new digital cameras instantenously . the print magazines are destined to be 3-4 months behind . if you are looking for the latest news , you will get them tape-delayed if you only read magazines . however , this magazine goes more in depth than some other ... popular magazines . the reviews are actually 4-5 pages long , not one-page politically correct recaps of the feature lists . ( still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews ) . having said all that , and understanding the limitations of print magazines , this is a good , affordable magazine to read if you are interested in digital photography . it has some useful and helpful information , reasonable reviews , and some interesting articles
0	bad journalism and plenty of adds ... .if you like to exoticize black people then this is your mag ... ..nothing to be gained here except maybe the cost
1	i have been a subscriber for some time . it 's a business publication that does not focus solely on wall street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for . think entrepreneur or general business topics and that 's business 2.0 . it does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball ' as well . monthly sections include `what 's next ' , `what works ' , `what 's cool ' . the articles are cutting edge in some cases , well researched and well written with an informal slant . they cover tech , marketing , product development , product design , ideas , new products and services , m 's and a wide range of general business topics . you will find out about new things before most of your coworkers , giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler , happy-hour settings . to go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s , the ads include autos like camry , land rover lr3 , mini cooper and even the porsche boxster , laptops , business productivity software like office 2003 , business products like copiers and printers , mobile calling plans , hp , credit cards and even lufthansa airline . so if you are not in this demographic , maybe they 're not targeting your demographic . why buy : you are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation ' of your career . you are entrepreneurial minded . you want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news . as a gift for someone with these interests
0	have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it . simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme . they say we americans are obese in body , but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism . page after page of glossy ads for things we do not need . and rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections . sure they make pretty pictures , but who wants all that 'junk ' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful . i recommend the magazine dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning . for someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden , oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply . and how many homes does one american need , when so many americans can not afford even one
1	this is what i use when i want to knit something for myself . the patterns are hip and young and they always feature the latest greatest designers . this is also much more about fashion than any other knitting magazine out there- lots of runway pictures and rail-thin models posing knitwear in exotic locations . i find that each issue has a good mix of projects of varying skill levels . i have knitted several and i 'm happy with the instructions and i 've never run across any major pattern mistakes . i find that the exact yarns , however , can be hard to find . they usually give you enough information about the yarn and desired effect so that you can easily substitute . while i 'm careful not to pick patterns that wo n't be embarrasing to wear next year , they do have a lot of hyper-trendy patterns . it would be a pity to waste all that time and money on something that would be decidedly `` out '' by the time you finsih it .
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift for my brother almost 5 months ago and he still has not received an issue . i can not get a straight answer from anyone about what is happening and i have not even been able to get my money back . i would not recommend anyone wasting their money with this magazine unless they can find a legitimate web site to get it from . kerr
1	road and track is like the tortise and the hare . it does n't move with lighting speed from trend to trend as some other publications . but its slow and methodical evolution yeilds a contemporary classic . it 's format and photography are faultless . the editorials are engaging , particularly peter egan 's . and no one can match the prowess of technical editor dennis semantis . quite possibly the best automotive magazine in the industry
1	i read the review marci carl about the jennifer chiaverini books the quilter'ed apprentice . i am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as i am your magazine . then i had to go get on the computor and found jennifer 's site . now i want to get back into quilting big time . my husband just rolls his eyes .
0	i was ecstatic when i received this magazine subscription as as gift . two issues into my subscription it stopped . i was really anticipating the december issue because i had many guests coming and could use some of martha 's helpful advice , however it never came and neither did january or february . i have called martha stewart living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic , i still have not received another issue . when i asked to cancel for a refund i was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless . very clever for martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer
0	unfortunately , there seemed to be no recourse after i ordered this for 2 newphews as a christmas gift , and it did not arrive . i tried to send an email to amazon.com but got bumped to someone else ( distributor ? ) who never responded . so disappointing since it was a gift for someone else . happened not once , but twice
1	foreign policy is a terrific journal . it goes beyond the conventional wisdom in an effective manner : topics are well-chosen ; orientation is not as predictable as new republic or tendentious as an academic journal . good links and bibliography . stimulating arguments and perspectives . i enjoy it ; recommend it ; and often give subscriptions to friends
0	i ordered this magazine on 10/7/06 ( over three months ago ) and haven ; t received a single copy yet ! ! ! stinky service ! !
1	this is simply one of the best movie magazines on the market . you can always be sure to be updated on the latest movies and dvd releases , and it 's nice that the crew of empire does n't take themselves too seriously ; the articles are well written but keeps the humour intact as well , where other movie magazines seem to be too keen on showing how intellectual they are . unfortunately it 's rather expensive here in denmark , but it 's worth the price
1	i have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads ... .not what an amateur is looking for . i wanted indepth articles , helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft . i found it here . i read every issue cover to cover and back again . i find helpful information in every issue . i highly recommend this magazine - even if you are n't purely an `` outdoor '' photographer
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product . it 's to give a good review until it arrives
0	if you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead . if you want better exercises and articles look to oxygen or women 's m
0	i ordered this item on 2/28/07 and i still have not received it ... today is 4/19/07 . i want a refund asap . and i 've been on hold forever trying to resolve this ... answer the phone
0	i made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen . i received a very good offer to subscribe , that i did n't want to turn down . i thought this was going to be like a better homes and gardens , or country living but it was n't . this appears to be a good choice for design professionals . i was just not very impressed
1	of the printed daily newspapers , wsj is easily the superior in just about every aspect that really matters . nyt has a lot more and better photographs , but they are best viewed on a computer screen . there 's not much to argue ( regarding the relatively conservative editorial page ) in this review that has n't already been written ; and one more center-right midwesterner 's recommendation is not going to be of much incremental value . however , as an investor and consumer i can state that wsj and its website have been the primary source of credible information about businesses , law , finance and consumer products . anybody that works for a living , has a mortgage or has a long-term savings plan would benefit from reading the wsj as often as possible . there 's simply no substitute
1	this is not your father 's business magazine . picked it up for the first time in a doctor 's office and stole the issue ( on real estate )
1	my only gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in gq magazine : they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio . these people use only brand new tools ( brand name label showing of course ) in a perfect-world dust free environment . the pictures make it look like it 's a sears catalogue . aside from that , the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer . i have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine i subscribe to . most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools , making it an approachable magazine for the diy'er . i highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with fine homebuilding magazine . in that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment . the articles in handyman are a bit more down-to-earth , but together you will get the most benefit
1	this is a great magazine for those of us who grew up in the 30 's and even on up into the 50 's .
0	this magazine is just page after page of hollywood p.r . agencies releases . unbelievable . why did n't i think of it ? i know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources , but other than a few pages of very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes and prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again and again and again . this magazine must not have a staff of writers , but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . the funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by , say , tom cruise 's management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , did n't you get the press release ? if you tivo extra and have the theme to entertainment tonight as your ringtone , this magazine is right up your alley . otherwise , do n't waste a penny on this nonsense .
1	i just wrote a review for opm , and had forgotten about this magazine . i also used to subscribe , and had recently let my subscription run out . i will not say it is not because i do not like this magazine , but because i am trying to save some money . but the fact is , that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market . the reviews are smart and fresh , never hackneyed , or cliched , the way a lot of other magazines are ( and some of my reviews , sorry guys ! ) . but the introductory article in each and every magazine , by the chief editor , always sounds like it has been written by a harvard grad , with a layman 's ability to make everything easy to understand . he has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together . never biased , they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews . i would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine , and like somebody else mentioned , better to go directly to the store , and get the discount card . after $ 150 - $ 200 in used game purchases , it pays for itself . highly recommend ! mc white said : if you 're a gamer , than you got ta have this magazine ! edit : believe it or not , when i got home , yesterday , just after writing this review , i had a copy of the september issue in my mailbox . i had forgotten , i had called customer service about a missed issue . they were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge , to cover my missed issue . i was quite impressed , and tickled pink , when i got my newest copy in the mail , when i arrived at my posh homestead . thank you game informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine .
1	i got cricket magazine in the mail when i was young . years later , it has lost none of its quality . it 's full of stories , articles , cartoons , jokes , puzzles . i remember some of the stories to this day . the text is always fun , always informative , never condescending . difficult words are defined , complex ideas are explained , and the reader is enchanted . the illustrations are beautiful , from many different styles . the stories are from the best writers for children , and they cover all manner of cultures and interests . i ca n't recommend this magazine highly enough
1	first off , most people do n't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they do n't have but desperately want -- at least , i do n't . this magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time . is n't our home supposed to be a haven ? someplace to return to from the hustle , bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love . this magazine simply caters to people with that ethic . it 's always full of ideas -- both trendy and traditional . it 's not full of `` buy , buy , buy ! '' hyper-consumerist propoganda -- it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun . anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect does n't turn to home magazines looking to be led , like a sheep , into the latest buying frenzy . most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever , inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives -- on our own budget . this magazine is always full of beautiful pictures , great advice , and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains . mainly , though , it 's about making the most of what you 've got , and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest . do n't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review . this magazine is worth every penny
0	my family received this magazine for years , but recently we have decided not to re-new our subscription . this used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue . at this point , nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements -- this is n't the real science magazine it claims to be , and is a waste of money . the content is not all that great . the articles are often extremely short , too short for even a pre-teen audience . my kids often wished that this magazine included more serious science topics , and not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much of the magazine is full of `` fluff '' -- things like word searches and picture matching games , which did n't interest my children . the content might be okay for 7-8 year olds and children at slightly lower reading levels , but older children will be bored . all in all , i 'd recommend that you simply get the regular , adult version of national geographic . though the articles might be too complex for children , the pictures will make up for what they ca n't read . if you 're looking for more of a children's-oriented magazine , you 're better off with muse , a high quality general science magazine that is published by the smithsonian museum in washington , dc . however , muse caters to a slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 and up .
0	just from picking up this mag in the store , and reading their spin-off `` pocket gaming '' , i have concluded that this magazine is pure rubbish , i would n't waste my money subscribing
0	it takes too much time to receive the first book . i have n't received the first book yet
0	writer 's digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers . the magazine ai n't one of them , however . for starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other writer 's digest products . one you get past paying $ 19.95 a year for what 's essentially a brochure , you 'll notice that most of the articles do n't apply to you . most writers stick to one genre , yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you 're working on a biography of j. edgar hoover , do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings ? i 'll take `` no '' for $ 600 , alex . so , now you 're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant . well , let 's start chipping away at that : the letters about grammar questions are a waste : if you have a question about affect versus effect , would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions are n't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space , like i used to do when i was the news editor at my college paper . ) writer 's digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers . my favorite was when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i 'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program . to be fair , some of the reviews are useful , although you can get better information just by looking up the product on amazon.com and reading the reviews there . if you 're going to writer 's digest for market information , you 'd be better served elsewhere : the annual writer 's market publication has all the markets and is more thorough , whilst the writer 's market website has all that information and is up-to-date . your money would be better spent on those two products . about the only articles i have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded . there you have it : two or three pages an issue that are useful . if you 're trying to get your work published , writer 's digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine : go with the annual writer 's market book , the website , and pick up a style manual of your choosing ( chicago is the best ) . do n't waste your money on this magazine
0	the reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight , but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna-be 's of true cultural wits like mencken and updike . some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns , and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable . i 'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag , and save your money to buy books that nourish you .
0	it is hard to review a magazine that i have yet to receive even though it was order 12/04/2005 . please let me know when i can expect to receive my 1st issue
0	i subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in pdf form . i was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them . frankly i was disappointed . the reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis , ( the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book ) . reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review ... please . they are also fairly out of date . most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while . some titles are n't available anywhere that i can figure . whats the point in reviewing an audio title you ca n't find ? my interest is primariy sci-fi , horror and romantic-horror . most of the titles audiofile reviews are fiction . the articles are n't particularly interesting . frankly i could care less what the narrator thinks or feels , as long as they have a good voice . there is also a sort of ... literay snob tone to audiofile . i get the feeling they like certain authors and certain titles and tend to overly focus on them . i 'd really like to see audiofile have a 'coming soon ' review column . it would be very useful to know what titles will be coming out in the future . i 'd also like to see more romance , dark fantasy , and horror reviews , or at least make the section focusing on different genres a little more clear . i also think the sections focussing on children 's titles and self-help are a little large . 2 stars . if you must subscribe , get the online version . that way you can cancel anytime , and do n't have to worry about subscription problems
0	i wish i had something good to say but i ordered this barron 's subscription back in august 06 . i 've had this newspaper before and do enjoy it . it is now november and i 'm still waiting . i called customer service and amazon promised to resolve but that was several weeks ago . my next call will be to ask for my money back . hopefully this is n't happening to other subscribers . i 've ordered several other magazines from amazon and always received them on a timely basis .
0	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves . they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11 . since that time , mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be , which might have been fine for one issue . this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas
0	about two years ago , vanity fair was not only the best magazine of the year , but maybe all time . i would read it from cover to cover . now , sadly , it is a bunch of fluff . the quality has really gone downhill . i am going to let my subscription run out . i really miss the old days
1	this is one of the best dog magazines of all time . the issues just keep getting better and better . this magazine goes beyond purebreds and honors mixed-breeds as well . it has wonderful rescue-related stories . one of the other reviewers compared the quality of the articles in this magazine with that of npr . that comparison really opened my eyes as i have for years enjoyed and appreciated the quality and fairness of the information provided by npr .
0	i ordered how for a graphic designer friend 's birthday in january and it is near the end of march and she still has not received anything ... so we have no idea how the product is ... we have not seen it
0	this magazine is another part of the murdoch empire . its worst sin is that its boring and not very conservative . it was founded by william kristol , john podhoretz and fred barnes to be a institutional conservative publication under tight control and with deep enough pockets to dwarf its smaller rivals . when conservativism was a living movement , it was best characterized as a collection of independent voices who while they respected each other did n't always agree with each other . now , following the murdoch formula , its about getting as many people whatever their ideology on the payroll . the price of being on the payroll is of course not rocking the boat . reading conservative publications these days is like reading the transcripts of someone engaging in a monologue in an echo chamber . its strange that there is so much `` conservative '' media today , but that most policy decisions do n't get debated or even discussed among conservatives . they seem more interested in covering liberals than discussing ideas or making proposals . and for god 's sake , no more articles by those who are agnostics in their private life talking about how america needs more god this or god that . if your going to be religious , at least find someone who is sincere . and no more articles on the greatness of family by childless unmarried women who are totally devoted to careers to the exclusion of anything else .
1	i purchased this magazine subscription on 03/05/07 why is it a month later and i still have not received it ?
1	the magazine has great , quality pictures and some interesting articles . the pictures of some golf courses are amazing and very professional . i love reading this magazine in my spare time . yes , the magazine is for golfers who always tended to have higher incomes . golf was always an expensive sport anyway . for golf instructions , i recommmend the ulimate golf instruction guide : key techniques for becoming a zero handicap golfer or better . this is written by patrick leonardi i wanted to share with other readers because this book made my golf game get much better . if you are like me , i was stuck around the same handicap . however , this book got me playing much better golf . for golf equipment , i definitely recommmend ping irons . great feel and distance with these clubs . for putters , i also recommend ping . they are the best . the ball putts straight and true . the feel is natural and unforced .
1	ladies home journal has several features that readers will like . one of the most popular is `` can this marriage be saved '' featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor 's advise . other columns include `` how they met '' , `` animal affairs '' , and `` raising a family '' . each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through habitat . a nice feature is a column presenting a man 's perspective called `` heart of a husband '' . there are also articles on beauty , health , travel , and parenting . there are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas . each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews . i highly recommend subscribing to ladies home journal , you wo n't be disappointed !
1	this magazine offers a complete guide to shooting anything that takes me outdoors
0	there was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking , tolerance , and openness to healthy , civil debate . no longer . and harper 's is a perfect symbol for all that ails the left . to call this magazine `` left leaning '' is a farce . it does n't lean ... it completely , totally , enthusiastically , and blindly tumbles and falls into the `` far left '' swamp . the tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan , reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of america . the quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years . this rag is about as credible now as the guardian , national enquirer , or , come to think of it , the new york times ! save your money , lol !
1	okay , it 's not one of the fancy , traditional mags but i found loads of things that generated ideas . the sections showing design elements carried through the house were my favorites . it may be on the advertising end of the spectrum in some regards , but i liked seeing similar ( but different ) approaches to the same design goal by various manufacturers . having all the web addresses made it easy for me to follow-up on designs i liked , and i did n't have to worry that the editors were trying to curry favor with their advertisers by pontificating on the merits of one item over another . i 'm a visual learner and this fit the bill . unlike another reviewer who would suggest that this is due to my gender , i think that people respond differently to the same presentation of material . do n't write this off because it 's not a marquee magazine -- try it first . you might just like it . and by the way , i do read and like magazines and books that have no pictures , too
0	while waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month ( july 2005 ) , i read through what i thought would be the familiar redbook magazine of the past . instead , i was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described . another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing . i felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read . i am age 48 , college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers . i would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice , nor do i think it appropriate for a magazine such as redbook . parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes . it has changed
0	when you watch commercial children 's television , you have to accept the commercials because , after all , the programs are `` free '' . but when you pay to subscribe to nickelodeon magazine , i do n't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children . these ads appear similar to the editorial content . it seems like 50 % of the pages are advertisements ! i was disappointed and wo n't be renewing our subscription . better to look at something from the highlights magazine series .
0	i 'm not sure who 's at the helm of this operation but i 'd be willing to bet they do n't get outside too often . not to be too cynical about it , but i just do n't find this mag to be as useful as it was before . if you like lots of articles on who the coolest extreme sports stars are , how they got their abs , and what gear they 're wearing , subscribe now . the magazine looks amazing , the photography is top notch and they still manage to come up with a thorny article on the environment periodically . but for my money , it just feels like the editorial staff has been plucked from new york image mags that do one thing really well - sell . i read national geographic adventure , and unlike outside , i use it for information because it has content
1	i am not a big magazine reader -- never have been , never really had time to ! however , a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read ... after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own ! this magazine covers everything ! it 's got tips for life , cooking , decorating , organzing , and getting the best deal for your money . a lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas , for instance , are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life . for example : the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler . the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me ... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great ! they do n't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do , and when they do it 's in an article where they had comparisons done ... always a recommendation , and usually more than one . the important thing here is they do n't say `` buy this product '' they say `` buy products that have such and such feature , make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair , and oh here 's an example of what we 're talking about . '' they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme . so , in conclusion , if you 're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life ... this is a great magazine . the information is helpful , applicable to normal everyday life ... and it 's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers
1	i can give this great music magazine no greater praise than to say that pretty much all of my favorite new bands in the last couple of years have been discovered through under the radar . on top of that , they also write great articles on some of my pre-existing favorite bands . under the radar generally has much better writing than some of the other indie music mags out there ( devil in the woods , rockpile , big takeover , etc . ) and fits my musical tastes perfectly
0	this magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work , had time to work out four hours a day , had your own chef , could go on vacation six months out of the year , or could afford ( or cared ) about fashion . otherwise do n't bother . they sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it
0	i was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas . it is n't really , and there is n't really that much to this magazine . it is just another tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked at the august and september issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on elton john 's out of africa fundraiser and the article on julian mcmahon . the rest of it was ads , and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in vogue magazine , but the same old ads you 'll see anywhere else , and they are annoying . there were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it `` plastic person syndrome '' ) mark consuelos , waay too much on jennifer garner and her baby , and other weird things , such as the trend of designer cupcakes . i wish i was kidding on the latter , but i am not , nor do i have $ 25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is jessica alba 's favorite . there was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here . despite the size of this magazine , there is very little to sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos of the same old same old , and tips for mimicking them . i am not interested in becoming a teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested in seeing vanessa carlton 's pad . this magazine is for you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , a subscription that is actually not a year ( it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine ) and your life 's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in new york because some celebrity did . this magazine is mediocre at best , and the worst part is , it has the exact same fashion advice as vogue . i went with vogue because there is substance in their magazine , and the ads are classy and very chic . leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at aol time warner .
0	i ordered in november and i am still waiting to receive this item
0	this magazine recently ( april 05 ) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time . number 1 was the sing-along scene from magnolia . other moments in the top 10 included the credits from austin powers 3 and one of eugene levy 's quotes from american pie . keep in mind , these are the 100 greatest movie moments of all time . this mag/rag is nothing more than the film section of fhm stretched out to full-issue length . utter trash
0	i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents ' subscription . it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about . frankly , the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack ; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters . a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers -- to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story -- any future coverage is designed to prove time 's initial position correct . the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event ; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories -- '' we told you so , we told you so . '' even worse , the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story . ca n't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn ? out of sight , out of mind is the mantra ... in fact , i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media ; newspapers are failing , television news ca n't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis . neutrality is dead . frankly , i do n't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant . time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states -- no more . iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page . african states are making vast strides towards democracy , we get an article about nigerian computer fraud . russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy , but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq . japan , one of the world 's most influential cultures , in the week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein 's puerile take on pornography and social deviants . but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks : how in the hell did our world become boring ? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer ? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage -- educate the reader about the world in which we live ; do n't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week . time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine , if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
0	i ordered star magazine in late december 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords . she stopped receiving it in june , well before her 12 month subscription expired .
0	i purchased a subscription as a gift last feb. and the recipient never recieved it ! instead they got a gift certificate from amazon and a vague explanation..
0	the writing seems to have come from under-educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool . i was n't sure if i was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles . this magazine is n't for men , it 's for boys . however , the one star is for the photos of the women which , we ca n't deny , both men and boys can appreciate
0	i never received this magazine so how would i be able to rate it ? ? i cant even find a way to let them know i never received it
0	this is one of the many magazines that float around the school library , and it is the most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all that is in it is pure celebrity gossip . there is really nothing else in here . if you like blurry photos of lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul and the like , ( blurry so you ca n't see the zits and the flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it was coming back . she was wearing a baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts are common among women wanting to hide a gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far as i can tell ) . if you want to read about the fact that nichole richie has acquired yet another chloe paddington , the fact that donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now that he has gotten her knocked up , or you would like to see photos of victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine is full of lies as well-for instance , one writer claims that young people like lindsay lohan can get higher car insurance rates for accidents they were not at fault in . false ! you only get higher rates if you are at fault . this magazine is nothing more than an overpriced tabloid . there is nothing of value in here . half the time the insider is some anonymous friend , and half the time the facts are n't right . avoid this thing at all costs , unless of course you are a celebrity worshipper . i 've got better things to do than worship people who have too much money for their own good . i 'll stick to more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch
1	my son is a sports junkie at 7 years old . he gets really excited everytime the issue shows up in the mail . it is an easy read for him and he loves the posters and pictures included in each issue . if you have a budding sports enthusist i would definetly recommend this magazine . besides the more reading your child does , the better it is for them , no matter the reading medium .
1	i 've subscribed to this magazine for years i 've saved every issue . whenever i 'm planning a trip i always refer to my collection of traveler for information about my destination . it 's easier than ever to find the articles because an index every article ever printed is listed on their web site . the articles are very informative and the pictures are awesome ! i love it
1	i order this magazine for my wife . she is a good cook but is enchanted with the magazin
1	the young rider is a child friendly magazine with bright photos and posters . they are realy good for even people who do n't love horses ! the young rider provides stories on horse lessons , pony roundups , jumping , english , and western events ! children who do n't like horses are sure to love horses after subscribing for the young rider ! it also has quizzes ! i know it 's good for ages 5-15 ! the young rider is always happy for you to send in letter or photos wich always have a chance of getting into the magazine . it talks about horses for sale and zillions more ! young rider gave me a penpall , nolege , posters , and many hours reading ! there is not anything wrong with the young rider ! it is a great magazine ! it is not just 5 stars it is 10,000 stars ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	excellent independent research ! investigative journalism at its best . it is neither a liberal nor a conservative publication , for neither republicans nor democrats are spared . politicians make a lot of claims , and mother jones looks beyond their words to see if they actually put them into action . as you will see when you read mother jones , many politicians ( both democrats and republicans ) do not `` put their money where their mouth is . '' also , ignore the reviews saying that it is biased . apparently , they consider facts that are inconvenient and run counter to their beliefs to be biased . what is interesting is that if they came across an article in mother jones that supported their beliefs , that they agreed with , then they would probably say that the article was impartial and fair . hey , the truth hurts sometimes . finally , the reviewers claiming that this is a liberal magazine because it talks about bush so often are misguided . mother jones does so many articles on bush because he makes so many claims and says so many things that are not supported by his actions . he is an easy target . they do articles on kerry and others too .
0	you know `` blush '' magazine ? its fictional headquarters are the set of the nbc sitcom just shoot me . you read their headlines and article ideas , and you know they 're based on this little piece of waste ! what shocks me is that i know 13-year-old girls get their dose of sex and guys information from it . very shallow , they try to be so sophisticated it ends up being naive ! stay away from i
0	i had , repeat had been reading this magazine for ten years or so . over that time they have really changed . i guess it started when they got a new editor four or five years ago . after that the adds changed from building suppliers to lexus ads . i do n't like seeing automotive and home stereo ads in my how-to magazine . the information is more akin to martha stewart than it is norm abrams . who by the way is hardly in there anymore if at all . not to mention the new guy , a stray they picked up from ask this old house , what an opie taylor he is . what makes him eligible to write something for toh magazine . i really miss steve thomas . the how-to 's though somewhat informative really lack the intricate details . all i can say is thank god tom silva still puts in some minutia of his wealth of information . if you 'd like a `` better homes and gardens plus magazine '' then this magazines for you if you want to learn something try fine homebuilding or at the least family handyman
0	cook 's illustrated is the first cooking magazine that i 'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover , even though they do insert advertisements for their own products , which i suppose , to them , makes this an `` ad-free '' magazine , but i 'm not surprised they 've bent the rules with that claim . the one time i found it necessary to contact cook 's illustrated about a customer service issue , i was simply floored by the treatment that i received ... i 'll simply leave it at that . i personally do n't intend on re-subscribing ( `` fine cooking '' , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find that this is the cooking magazine for you . and , as far as what they do goes , cook 's illustrated is good at what they do - i 'll give them that . if you have not found this review to be helpful , i 'm sorry if i have n't made the value in my warning apparent . just know that there are those of us out there who have had bad experiences , and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same .
1	this past summer i picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before i finally got around to reading them . i was impressed . the quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine i 've seen . the image quality , the paper , all top notch . this is a fine arts magazine and does n't ( at least from what i saw ) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art . rather , it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work . there are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine i 've read . i intend on subscribing .
1	this magazine really gives you good info on piloting today
1	i have been a subscriber of shop etc . since its debut , when i heard that they were going to publish a magazine for familes i ran to subscribe and i have not been disapointed yet ! i love it
0	this magazine is just page after page of hollywood p.r . agencies releases . unbelievable . why did n't i think of it ? i know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources , but other than a few pages of very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes and prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again and again and again . this magazine must not have a staff of writers , but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . the funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by , say , tom cruise 's management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , did n't you get the press release ? if you tivo extra and have the theme to entertainment tonight as your ringtone , this magazine is right up your alley . otherwise , do n't waste a penny on this nonsense .
1	too often in america we are fed news by deceiving journalists ( such as those that work for fox news ) . the economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to america 's . it is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world , from politics to economics to science to the arts . best of all , the articles ( except for the special report ) are concise , allowing for an easy read .
1	i picked up a copy of spirituality health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away . this magazine is wonderful if you 're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life . this magazine covers everything ; mind , body , and spirit , the total package . in the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in . i highly recommend this magazine , as i always catch myself saying to someone , `` i just read this awesome article in spirituality health ...
0	i ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it .
0	i trashed the issue when i saw the shot of trashy paris hilton . there is enough nudity already in your publication and seeing that sad piece of work ( her ) on the cover just turned me off completely . sorry you thought her 'cover worthy ' . probably missed some fine articles . sincerely : deane everett
0	if you 're a teenage guitarist and want to learn nickelback , green day , and nu-metal songs , then this magazine is for you . there 's also some pretty good tips for beginners from time to time . but in the last several years the quality of the feature articles and interviews has gone steadily downhill , and there are far too many ads . as many people have said , sometimes it does n't seem to be geared towards musicians at all anymore . the smarmy , `` hipper than thou '' rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style of writing seems to be taking over the mag . and other styles of music such as blues , country , jazz , etc , are pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you 're a teenager and you see it on the newsstand and there 's a song in it you would like to learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine
1	i 've made better gains in 4 magazines of powerliftingusa than my 10+ years of muscle flex . no more mindless rep after rep of the same exersizes only to show little ( if any ) gains for your efforts . this is a must for those fed up with the 230 page fitness mags with over 200 of them being advertisements being jamed down your throat ( no pun intended ) . if you want to make real gains you ca n't argue with the methods that are tried true by those who squat over 1000lbs bench 800+ . i 'm pushing more weight than ever my joint pains are gone now that i 'm lifting correctly not the m way . best weightlifter magazine period . buy it now .
1	for those of us who miss being in the center of the universe , reading the observer is almost like being there . in its pink pages i can read stories about new york 's political , arts , society , finance , sex and gossip scene . i can smell the inside of a taxi from my house overlooking the lake in vermont
1	this magazine is the best there is . there is page after page of beautiful designs and excellent instructions . i have bought some books that do n't have as many beautiful knitting projects in them as one issue of this magazine
0	i have subscribed to discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription . the magazine , which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag . from juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers op-ed page , the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash
0	i had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample . it is a lovely magazine , beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about `` other coasts '' ( besides east and west ) . but , at least with the most recent issue , in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian . even the advertisements had only white people ( save for one about vacationing in mexico that had some cute mexican children in it ) . while i doubt this is intentional , i would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue . there are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about
1	i read the nation for its poetry , katha pollitt and takes on the news . it 's a left wing magazine . i do n't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect `` objectivity '' . humans have opinions and viewpoints . even time magazine and the national review have viewpoints .
1	if you are a beginner vegetarian , or just want to reduce your meat consumption , this is a great magazine . friends who are vegan were n't as crazy about this because a lot ( though not all ) recipes are ovo-lacto . good lifestyle information and recipe re-dux
1	esquire has gone through a lot of changes over the years . it went from a old style gq clone to a magazine that has broadened its writing , reach , and content . esquire now occupies a unique nitch in the world of men 's magazines . it offers intelligent , thoughtful commentary on life , music , movies and celebrity , occasionally good fiction , good advice columns , a special but brief look at an extraordinary woman in each issue , and heartfelt stories on real issues that affect men , like an author detailing his battle with cancer . another big bonus , esquire is not oversaturated with advertisements when compared to gq and other similar magazines . by comparison to some , esquire is about 1/3 the size for the same content . esquire also annually publishes the world 's sexiest woman issue . entertaining and well photographed , it sets esquire apart because they also chose to celebrate the beauty of women in their 30s , 40s and 50s , rather than concentrate on the month 's latest piece of starlet fluff . at under a dollar an issue , esquire is one of the best deals in town , and is the perfect non-expensive gift for someone in your life most magazine subscriptions end up costing you an arm and a leg , but this price is well worth the content .
0	i have been subscribing to us weekly for about a year and a half . in that time , i have never seen an issue without several pages of jessica simpson . i have to wonder ; does jessica donate money to this magazine ? she seems to dominate the whole magazine , each and every week . i wo n't be renewing my subscription . i 'm tired of jessica and the untruths that us weekly supplies
1	love this magazine ! just wish it came out more often . great for more than those with farms or homesteads . articles on gardening , building projects , animals . buy it
0	this was to go to my son who chose it in his wish list . instead it is coming to me and i can get no response . please send this to my son and not to m
0	i use to subscribe to shape several years ago , and then it was packed full of great work out routines , meal plans , etc for women at all levels of fitness . well . . . my last few months of shape have been a complete disappointment . i found very few pages of good genuine fitness and healthy eating advice . instead , it ranks right up with glamour in the category of magazines with the highest percentage of advertisements , nearly all of the excercise material is supposed `` quick fix '' fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations , and the healthy eating advise is absolutely elementary . there is no substance in here for women like me , the average working woman who desire to live a healthy life everyday and have limited time to commit to exercise . i want a magazine that is inspiring with a focus on living a sustained healthy lifestyle , not a joke about getting flat abs in a week with illustrations of perfectly chiseled models who obviously do not face the body challenges of average women . i 'm sorry but most women are not going to look like `` her '' after two weeks , or many months of shape 's 10-30 minute a day routines , but they sure lead you to beleive so . i highly recommend `` her sports '' it is the magazine for women desiring to live an active , day-to-day healthy life
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive , but it 's mostly advertising . very disappointing . it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it ( which is why it got 2 stars from me ) , but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription
0	this is a tabloid , so most likely the stories you 're reading are not true . why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that , a rumor
0	my biz partner and i were excited to receive our first mag from this group . we were sorely disappointed . most of the articles are not new information , but `` rehashed '' info widely available . we read it cover to cover for about 4 months , then cancelled the subscription . there are better sources out there and this is not one of them !
1	i 've been reading glamour for the past three years and it has been a great magazine all around . glamour covers topics on health , career , finances , sex , relationships , style , etc . of all the magazines on the newsstands , this one is the most intelligent and savvy for women in their 20s and 30s . yes there are too many ads like in most magazines , but that 's how the media survives , they get their salary mostly from ads . i usually do n't mind because i feel that its such a great magazine , that the ads are worth putting up with . i have felt that at times cosmopolitan is a little too focused on sex and `` please your man '' articles . glamour seems to have found a nice balance and i do n't feel that it dumbs down my intelligence at all . i do wish that they would expand beyond the typical articles . i wish that they would include more sections on culture , travel , and technology . men 's magazines include articles on gadgets and tech , and as a woman i enjoy gadgets as well . its not just a guy thing . its not a perfect magazine , some issues are better than others , but i feel that at this time glamour is the best magazine for women right now .
0	i purchased this item in january , but i have n't seen it yet . it take a long time
1	most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite . this is the only weekly newsmag i can stand to read , and i love to read it . us news is a grab bag of topics , international is excellent ( vs. other us sources of news ) , finance business is excellent , science is a grab bag , books arts is quite good , and the periodic special reports are great . cheeky and clear , a delight to read . bring your skepticism , though , because the reporters columnists are not shy about taking a position , and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion .
1	i love house beautiful ! it gives so many wonderful ideas . this is a collection of ecclectic styles , patterns , and methods that will suit anyone 's taste . and these ideas are n't hard to follow . with the smallest effort , anyone can follow the look they have in the magazine
1	i subscribed to details because i 'm interested in the male psyche . i also like looking at the male celebrity pictures and the guy models on ads . its not the most politically correct article on the planet , for one the last page is called `` gay or ... ? '' in which the writer tries to uncover if a certain type of person is gay or not , and no conclusion is actually ever given so i suppose its for the reader to decide . its a very stereotypical part of the magazine , but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives . i also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews , in addition they include interviews with female celebrities . i do n't agree with everything that is printed here , but certain articles have made me think and i 've actually gotten a lot out of it . it helps me understand guys and i do agree with certain opinions . the mag leans toward the liberal and is unabashed in its attitude to do so . i like it a lot , it may not be for everyone and that 's fine .
1	i remember when this magazine was the lone conservative voice on the newstands . i too have memories of many long latinate sentences which mr.buckley provided and i had to try and figure out . it is not that i always agreed , much less understood him . but i did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer , who had a real concern for public life in america , and his own ideas of how to make it better . i also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion- journal which explored many aspects of american reality . the magazine today seems to me still to be of high- quality , though mr. buckley is no longer at the helm .
1	this magazine is so packed full of goodies that you may need something with wheels to carry it out . the paper alone is worth the price . there are a lot of good books on decorating . and more on picture of foreign places . this one however is of items that you will want and maybe even afford one or two , if you have not spent all your discretionary money on books and book cases . every library should have a fire place and this magazine often shows some of the best surrounds . the furniture and art work is well within the norm but just beyond the ordinary . even if you do not take advantage of the ads and articles to spruce up your abode , you can sit back and dream of being there .
1	i do n't know if anyone else out there has noticed this , but jane magazine has gone through an a-m-a-z-i-n-g transformation ! i picked up the october issue this week , and was shocked to find out that it not only has gone through a visual transformation . ( it now looks a lot like a hip , european magazine-kind of like `` jalouse '' , my favorite french publication ) , but also , the information provided inside is really valuable and applicable to my lifestyle . ( i am 24 ) there 's tips for decorating your home with cool silkscreened rock posters , delicious recipes for dinner guests on a budget , and really great fashion coverage that is not at all cookie-cutter and formulaic like some of the other women 's books ( aka lucky , glamour , etc ) also , the voice of the writers is so clever , and funny-i would hang out with these girls ! ! anyway , i am not going to go on and on like a crazy person , but i was so excited that i wanted to share with u folks-follow my lead and pick up a copy ( or a subscription ) asap ! !
1	the london review of books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature , the arts , culture , history , politics , philosophy published in the world today -- it now beats the ny review of books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the tls back in the dust . if you want to get your bearings in the world of culture and politics , this is must reading . denis jonnes washington d. c./kitakyushu , japan
0	i was pleased with the magazine but even though i renewed my suscription for the third year ( and i was charged ! ) i never got any more magazines . upon requesting amazon what had happened , they answered that they would not accept my renewal ( no reason whatsoever ) that they 'd return my money ( not yet , after 6 months ) and that they would send 2 or 3 issues at no cost for my trouble ... ( i have n't gotten anything ) . i do n't trust suscriptions throu amazon anymore
1	... and while , yes , i 've made comments in the past about how oprah has changed a little , this is about a publication . i 'm sure that the person who wrote that `` this is just another magazine full of things one ca n't afford '' reads fashion or celebrity magazines full of many things she ca n't afford . advertising generates money and , while i do n't like ads either , they are everywhere because advertising works . if you do n't want to see them , do n't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . as far as the layouts being `` too full of clutter '' ... everyone has their own style . there are some people who like that look and do n't prefer a pared-down , zen look . magazines are not about reality . if they were , they would n't be plastered with plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i 'm originally from middle america , and nobody looks like that there . just take magazines and ads for what they are . save your money , like i do , for things you just have to have . if you do n't have the perserverence to do that , then stick to the target and walmart circulars . the knock-offs are never far behind .
1	my husband is a culinary student , so i ordered this magazine subscription . he looks forward to each issue , and is always finding ideas when he reads fw . i know we 'll subscribe for many years to come . this is a fun magazine for those who enjoy cooking , both at home or in a professional setting
0	i was looking forward to another oprah magazine with great joy . unfortunately , the pomp and circumstance within `` o at home '' 's pages is a real turnoff for me , an average , middle-class american living , as they say in `` middle america '' . although i hesitate to say this in print , it 's been in my head for ahile now . i am a faithful 20-year oprah viewer but something has begun to change in her attitude and it is evidenced in this new magazine . is it possible that oprah has not only forgotten her roots , but has now skipped over all the stages in between her roots and now living in a gazillion-square-foot house in malibu ? is it possible that she has forgotten the 90 % of us who live somewhere in between ? if this magazine is an indication , then sadly , she has
0	i have been a subscriber to cgw for almost 10 years . sadly , i have to end the subscription now . it was a very good magazine ; but no more . one reason is that more than half of the magazine are now ads . the second reason is that the size of the magazine is getting smaller and smaller with the layout that is getting very hard to read . and the reviews are bad . the reviews do n't have a professional kind of feel anymore . i ca n't totally blame the magazine . a big part is due to the gaming industry . there is no good game anymore . they are all fps and mmorpg . just how many time you can review the same type of games ? one positive thing about cgw is that it now comes with a dvd full of demo . i think the dvd alone is worth the subscription . but for me , it is done
1	budget travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland . i also like some , not all , of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written . however , at the same time , it does need better organization as compared with ( horrors ) conde nast . i am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible - i cant access it ! !
1	i have been reading this magazine and love it . perfect for those of us who decorate in the shabby , cottage , romantic or new cottage style . there has recently been a change in editors or something like that and i see quite a difference in the magazine lately . not too happy about it . it used to have great decorating ideas for the average person . now their showing us castles etc . and pages of retailers with yarn shops , not to mention all the gardens . pages wasted as far as i am concerned . a little was fine but pages and pages . i do n't know if i will continue to buy , probably give it another month or 2 to see . worth checking out to see if it is for you .
0	i have been a reader of businessweek for over 10 years . i have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year . while there are more articles on `` personal business '' , the hard-core articles have gone the way of newsweek , and u.s. news and world reports . the nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today . like many others , i have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year . specifically , their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left . bob kuttner is co-editor of the american prospect and contributor to the boston globe . every one of his articles begins with the premise that the president 's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis , to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson is better , but as a former clinton advisor , is not objective in her analysis . alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout , does not agree with the numbers stated in their own figures of the week . while bw has the potential for great reporting based on their resources , they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting . for serious business readers and students , i recommend going to alternative sources . and yes , i will let my subscription lapse this year .
0	first issue arrived today . after tearing up 8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult to read the magazine , i sat back to enjoy . first article was a lecture by robert f. kennedy jr. on the danger of mercury in fresh water domestic fish . perfectly safe to fish we are informed ( well duh ) . just do n't eat what you catch . expectant mothers should be extra careful as babies with high level of mercury have lower iqs . the net is full of peer-reviewed studies from major universities on the subject of mercury poisoning . why buy a food magazine to read what an activist lawyer has to say about the subject ? next article was in : `` politics and the plate '' . the controversy here concerns local and season foods . gourmet asks : `` are those who promote them sincere ? or is it just a come on for gullible diners ? '' so who does gourmet think is `` gullible '' ? the reader ? implication seems to be the reader is too stupid to figure out that yes , vendors might promote locally grown products that are n't all that terrific . nothing of substance in this article at all . going back to the front , an editor of gourmet recalls how her late father did n't appreciate health food stores ( are n't fathers stupid ? ) . three downer articles in a row . i gave up . this is n't the magazine i remember from 20 years ago . even the format is annoying . it is difficult to know where ads end and articles begin ( recall the most junked up website you 've seen , that is the gourmet model ) if you do enjoy the politics and the environmental stuff ( on either side ) you can do better on the net for free . if you want entertaining , informative articles on food , gourmet is not the place to look . subscribed to saveur at the same time as gourmet . it is a pleasure to read . no annoying ads , no political screeds . great photographs . interesting and exotic recipes . as good or better than gourmet was decades ago .
1	i'v been taking this mag since it was called boot . it still has the best overall info for builders , but they are starting to get a little trendy in their pages .
1	i admit it ; i 'm addicted ... not to the heavy stuff , but instead head-over-heels in love with audiobooks . and they have found a friend in audiofile , a truly wonderful magazine that informs addicts like me about the latest trends , equipment , books to hit the market . the down is that it 's only published every other month . i voraciously read it both on line and the `` hardcover '' edition that arrives in my mailbox . some other reviewer complains that the reviews are nothing more than recaps . while they are short and to the point , i disagree about the contents of the reviews . they 're exactly what i 'm looking for : an overview of the book , not an in-detail new york times type review . if i want to learn more i then check with amazon to see what others feel . while i still purchase and read print books ( they 'll never go out of style ! ) , i have found audiobooks a great alternative to curling up with agatha christie . and , hopefully , audiofile , along with my newfound addiction to audiobooks , will continue to prosper and grow . it 's good to be in on the ground floor
1	i look forward to recieving my magazine every month . i really love this magazine . it has articles , marriage , sex , women 's lives , etc . i do n't know why the others did n't enjoy it .
0	i have enjoyed reading family fun magazine , but unfortunately have only received 2 issues . i have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service . i will not order another magazine from amazon because of this poor service . i tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around .
1	the magazine is being delivered as per the agreement . some people especially the avowed liberals would not want this magazine as this presents a strong conservative viewpoint .
1	most magazimes half of their pages is advertizmet , this one have something to say and did make me some money when i used their top 10 stock picks for next year , that was january 99 , the semiconductor boom , all 10 out of 10
1	what i like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative . i have bought the last three issues and ca n't wait for the next one . this magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines . this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i have picked one up . every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry . at the beginning of this year i noticed that some of the `` popular '' or `` modern '' `` digital review '' magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now . i need to see the technology that is cutting edge or even around the corner . so far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck . good luck
0	spin will do anything to try and stay hip . i wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their `` tribute '' to kurt cobain mag . im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures . they were poorly written and dull . they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt 's music , and his impact on an entire generation . i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin..
0	have n't received this item . it has been almost 2 months
0	i dont enjoy this publication at all anymore , dont know if editorial leadership has change
1	my mother bought me a gift subscription when i moved in to my first apartment . i love this magazine . i pass the recipies on to family and friends , who have enjoyed them as well . the simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $ 30 or so for a subscription . i am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week .
1	ah , the men 's magazine . so many out there , where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing ? ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out , and for me , fhm is a cut above the rest for the following reasons . 1 . articles are more intelligently written , less sophmoric , and delve on a wider array of issues . 2 . paper quality is high glossy and sturdy , while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison . paper feels like the same paper used by playboy . 3 . quality of women featured . fhm has by far a higher quality of women . maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder , while fhm features beautiful , sexy , intelligent , and funny women whose interviews are actually readable . 4 . fhm top 100 women special . wow . worth the money right there . [ ... ] only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month 's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues . that is annoying
0	i subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction/non-fiction books - what it turns out to be is a series of editorials , premised around virtually all non-fiction . all very high-brow and frankly , quite boring . the one item worthwhile is the classifieds . i think i 'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund . i anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues , i have n't seen anything of interest
0	its been months and i still have not recieved my copy of this magazine . they had no problem charging my credit card , but they cant seem to get a copy of this weekly magazine out in under a quater of a year . what a bunch of nonesense .
1	workbench is a magazine aimed at do-it-yourself type people who like to work on their own home improvements and save money in the process . this publication presents dozens of woodworking ideas for home improvement and a few for hobby , with plenty of instructions and diagrams to make sure you get it right . most of workbench is focused on the exterior of one 's home . as you page through an issue , you will notice plenty of articles on building wooden decks , new porches , and other decorative ideas to improve the outside appearance of your residence . there are a few projects for the inside , usually dealing with construction of cabinets , bed frames , and other things . but for the most part , the articles deal with outdoor woodworking tasks . i like the photos in this magazine because the projects always look so fancy . they are perfectly constructed , clean , and well- finished and they make you want to get off your booty and start working on your own home . in many cases , the articles in this magazine do tend to make things seem a little too easy when , in reality , these projects can often take many days or even weeks to finish . but the end results are worth it not only from a financial standpoint , but also from the sense of pride you feel from a job well done . workbench is a little more expensive than other magazines , but for those who enjoy working with their hands , this publication is worth the cost . with some effort and some good ideas , you can greatly improve your home 's appearance and value with some new outdoor trimmings . workbench shows you exactly how to get the job done with plenty of woodworking projects to enhance your residence inside and out .
0	as is typical of many magazines , sunset jams it to existing subscribers . they offered me a `` deal '' to re-subscribe for 12 months for $ 29.95 ! here on amazon , i can get two years ( 24 months ) for $ 29.95 . magazines need to understand basic marketing . it takes a lot of advertising dollars ( mailings ) to get a new subscriber . once you have a subscriber it is easy to keep them if you treat them right . charging existing subscribers double what is offered to new subscribers is bad business
1	i picked up a copy of health at my local grocery store , mostly out of curiosity . i found myself enjoying it enough so that i will be ordering a subscription . here 's why : 1.it encompasses every facet of health , not just diet or exercise . as one reviewer noted , it is broken down into categories : looks , living , moving , feeling , and flavor ( it was just redone ) . the articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable . i particularly enjoy the feeling and living sections , as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines . 2 . unlike many other magazines , i found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine . i , like most others , enjoy getting the most for my money . while everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a `` good '' magazine , this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house
1	bookmarks magazine magazine review by viola beauregarde , 11.13.2005 the fractured chronicles [ blog ] http : //violabeauregarde.blogs.com out of all the literary magazines i have read over the years , bookmarks magazine is one of the finest . it offers the reader not only an in-depth listing of the newest literature in print , but upcoming books , books to movies , and old favorites . each book is rated from the best to the worse review in order to give a broader and more balanced perspective . this also includes critical summaries , which are invaluable . the insightful author studies give the reader a concise and informative glimpse at the author behind the literary work . if you only subscribe to one literary magazine this year , spend your hard-earned money wisely and get bookmarks magazine . believe me , you will not be disappointed
0	when i first heard there was an american version of l'uomo vouge i was really excited . i thought `` finally an american men 's fashion magazine that 'll be edgy , risky , creative original ! '' i could n't have been more wrong . this magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster men 's magazines gq , esquire details . european men 's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography , bold reporting beautiful advertising . you wo n't find any of this in men 's vouge . the editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of american readers . if i could i 'd give this magazine a negative 5
1	the wine spectator is the ultimate guide to wine . as a magazine , it gives trusted up-to-date information on wine and related issues . i look forward to each issue and always find something interesting . i would definitely recommend this periodical to all wine lovers
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life . instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images , people we will never meet , and in many cases people who have very little going for them . does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything , or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence ? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j.lo is engaged ( in order to get on the cover of another magazine ) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns
0	i am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\ sure it would be good if i was ever to get one ? dave tuman new bern , nc
1	beautifully done , kids discover issues are packed with information on one specific subject ( ie : volcanoes , the civil war ... ) . my daughter is 8 and a good student . she uses these magazines as reference texts more than as casual reading material . i think these magazines would be enjoyed most by parents and students between the ages of 10 to 14 .
1	this is the best business and money magazine out there . they cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you did n't think of .
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen . that was a bad decision . after having received two issues , i continue to be disappointed . the quality of the art design , and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky . i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine .
1	i am a big fan of this magazine , but even more so of the `` free '' cd -- when it is good , it is very good . so i finally subscribed despite the stiff price . two issues came , i was happy , then a third without the cd , and then ... no more . after many calls and complaints , amazon finally secured a partial refund -- not exactly what i wanted . here 's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out -- maybe an opaque wrapper
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out .the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole . it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections ' of the country . the reporting itself is clear and very readable . the paper lacks weight and depth . it has a lot of variety in its features , and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable . it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers .
1	like one commentor said ... '' the truth hurts '' . it does ... if you 're happy with your martha stewart and scott peterson news , do not buy this magazine . if you want the real dirt , left or right wing ... this is it . they shoot from the hip . if you want the truth and not what you will see on the mainstream media , this is the magazine . they are well known to publish stories that the ny times is afraid to publish . as a matter of fact , most of the writers on mother jones and the nation used to write for the times . and i just heard last week two stories written by ny times writers that they 're publishers would n't print . so guess who did ? if you doubt me , look up the 25 most censored stories of 2004 and 2005
0	time magazine named george bush as person of the year , despite the economic , international and ecological damage he has done and will continue to do over the next four years . speak and be heard . cancel your subscription .
0	do n't get me wrong , occasionally there are issues i still read cover to cover , but it seems as though mj has gone through a change lately . gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing . now the focus seems to be health , fitness and diet . i used to buy men 's health magazine for those topics . if i wanted that focus i would continue to buy mh . there is no longer a consistent reason to read mj on a regular basis anymore . man , i miss the old mj
1	i 've been an off-and-on subscriber to si since i was a kid . i 've grown to love the magazine and idolize a few of the staff writers . despite being the best , the magazine is far from perfect . lately , i 've found that many of the articles deal with things that i , and many sports fans , probably do n't care about . and they give too much coverage to pro football when it 's in season , even though i 've noticed that the football coverage is among the worst in the magazine . there are a few writers who i ca n't stand ( die austin murphy ! ) and some who think they are better than they really are ( rick reilly ) , and some who are underappreciated ( steve rushin ) . however , some of the finest reading i 've ever done has been in sports illustrated . there are some stories that stick with you for years . si beats the crap out of the terrible espn magazine , which seems more interested in comedy than in sports .
0	this is a yuppie magazine for people with endless bank accounts and nothing to do with their money . what 's more is i did n't see a thing that had anything to do with actual gardens !
0	it seemed like there were 2 articles 80 pages of advertisements
0	the recipes included are good , but this is not a `` cooking '' magazine . this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise . while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness , it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine . there is way too much other junk . if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine , i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that .
1	i was in the travel industry for years , and found cn to be an excellent , albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations , and all other aspects of travel , whether upscale or backpack . yes , it is not encyclopaedic , and yes it is chock full of adverts . however , the latter brings the cost of publication , no doubt , and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue . their travel product ratings are next to none , and shortlists the selection process , allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions
1	this is my favorite magazine . i subscribe to a lot of them but always end up reading this one the most . keep up the good work
0	for some strange reason , i began receiving this magazine in the mail . never ordered . never paid for . my conclusion based on reading the last three issues : you 're kidding me . how can time inc. still publish this rag ? what 's the point
0	... 1 ) i ca n't ; 2 ) on second thought , it deserves at least one star for having some silly , funny stuff that you do n't find in other magazines . that said , it is grossly overrated . how is it consistently in the top sellers list ? well , there are as many millions of folks with a below average iq as there are above average . it 's too bad they ca n't play up the silly humor a bit more while leaving the abhorrent juvenileness out . the images are generally trashy and sometimes airbrushed to the point that it looks fake and ridiculous -- they could improve the quality of the photos a lot . admit it , you would probably hide an issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected . does n't that say it all ? reconsider the standards you are setting for yourself , and respect your own brain , too
1	i finally subscribed to glamour after buying it every month at the grocery store , each time saying it would be the last time i bought this `` vapid silly thing . '' what can i say ? it 's addictive . we ca n't read the economist all the time now , can we
0	home business magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further . this magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end . i read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship . home business is the only one i read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and , unfortunately , it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be . probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way . i realize that people like lists but home business takes this a little too far . it makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac . for example , it is common to find a one page article with a title like `` effective ways to design a newspaper ad '' , or `` how to obtain quick financing '' . in each instance , these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question . this makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material . another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising . not only does it get out of hand , it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material . advertisements with titles like `` really lazy guy 's incredible little secret idea can make you rich '' , `` free $ 9.95 report shows you how to make a fortune '' , and `` six figures in six months '' clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package . some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it 's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating . i like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business . but even here , the stories are inconsistent . some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share . and to make matters worse , they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page . speaking of the advertising , this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess . advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement . the ads are posted everywhere , often right in the middle of an article , and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine . this magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine . in other words , this magazine has no continuity to it . it 's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the usa and then piecing them together into one magazine . starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good , timely information when you find yourself in this situation . home business , unfortunately , does n't perform its mission very well . if you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles . but the majority is too impersonal and too shallow ( not to mention smothered in advertisements ) to make this magazine worth the trouble .
0	i got this magazine for a year and a half before i had to quit my subscription recently . i liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style , and that is why i subscribed to begin with . but i was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me . ( not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway , so that 's not a complaint ) . sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased ( telling the facts of stds and such ) , but 90 % of the articles on sex , were opinion and not fact . girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like seventeen who say that sex is good if you 're ready ( what 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an std or a baby ? ? please . ) , and that condoms are 100 % effective . they are not , but that 's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this . they need to take advice from their parents and doctors , not magazine articles . i was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .
0	vogue knitting does not have customer service , strange as it sounds . i 've bought subscription through amazon and received 1 issue ; i since moved to another state and all my magazines followed me except vogue knitting . all pleas , e-mails and other attempts to communicate with magazine failed - its been over 6 months and 2 missing issues and i still dont have my magazine ; probably wo n't . on the other hand , why would vogue knitting worry about lonely subscriber whose money they long spent
0	why ? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it has nothing to do with natural health . it has to do with advertisements . it is empty , completelly . more : it looks like a woman magazine but i believe that a clever woman would feel like i feel now , angry ! i paid for something that i believed but it is not . ok , we make mistakes
0	i subscribed to food wine for a while and was continuously disappointed . the articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been . i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff . the magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad . this magazine ca n't hold a candle to bon appetit or gourmet
0	how people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me . all the usual suspects are found through out it 's pages . this rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for : polictal correctness , anti-capitalists , anti-gobalisers etc with all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head . what 's more the 'ideas ' you 'll find here have been tried , tested and more importantly failed . ah well ... some people are just too easy to fool
0	this is just like the english version but in spanish . the content does not reflect the culture or morals of the general latino people . nearly all models ( especially on the cover ) are white and/or american and are very thin and tall . they try to use photos of american celebrities when they have brown hair , for example christina aguilera , mandy moore , angelina jolie or just natural brunettes like catherine zeta-jones . maybe cosmo thinks we 're too ignorant and can be easily fooled by the dark hair dye job or the computer generated tans . there are tons of beautiful and succesful latinas that could easily be placed on the covers but i think they 'd rather just use the same photos that they already took for their english-version magazines . the ads are also for high-end american and european products . i 've bought this magazine in mexico and while it still has the same problems at least they feature real mexicans and mexican products in some of the ads . if you want a magazine that more reflects latino culture , although it 's mostly in english , get latina magazine . they use lots of latina models and it 's more relevant to latin-american women and people interested in latino culture
0	i ordered a subscription in jan and just received my first issue in may after several calls . unfortunately , it is in italian which is not mentioned in the details on amazon . they offered to refund the remaining subscription but the first issue cost me $ 25 . unless you can read italian and are very patient , i would pass on this periodical .
0	the magazine does have good information , but not for a child ... it 's more geared to an adult . watch out though ! they like to send you notices of collection if you do not renew the magazine when your subscription is up
0	i have n't received this product yet and i 'm pretty upset about it . i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer . i think i 'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer . where is the product i bought ? ? ?
1	i am really liking this magazine already because it focuses particularly on multicultural and biracial marriages , brides , grooms , weddings , everything ! this mag focuses on brides of every color and overall just average brides in general . there is focus on how to incorporate dierent heritages into the details of the wedding from the gown to the reception . i also really enjoyed the little feature on biracial celebrity pairs and of course the gorgeous ring and gown spreads ! i definitely recommend this magazine if you are in a biracial relationship , blending two cultures into one wedding ( or both ! ) , or maybe you just want tips or ideas so you can plan a unique around the world cross cultural wedding just for fun . if an all white wedding is not for you in more ways than one than this is the magazine to pick up
0	like `` where 's waldo '' , it seems every issue must have at least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this is admitedly a classic piece of furniture , one gets the impression that there are a gaggle of designers telling their clients , `` you have to have one of these , they 're what 's in ! '' most of the features in metropolitan home suffer from the same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes with the same dreary interiors that obviously were foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients by designers who know how to make an easy buck . `` modern '' equals , of course , a mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up in this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month of 1970 's florals , faux louis the whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through the dreck and finding something useable for your own purposes , it 's painful to look through this magazine . if you really want ideas for making your house reflect you , trust yourself and what you like , and if you do like mies van der rohe daybeds , by all means get one . just do n't plunk one in your sun room because you were told it 's trendy . if you like the modern style , look up the works of hans wegner and peter hvidt and go from there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years of hard use by real families and is sturdy as well . maybe you want a house where nobody is allowed to set foot in any of the rooms and amounts to a bad hodge-podge of styles that all seem a bit busy and bumpy . for everyone else , think about the things you 'd like to see if you walked into a room , save your money and skip this magazine
1	... once you tear out the subscription cards , there are no ads ( unless you count one unobtrusive one buried in the publisher 's information , telling you how to renew your subscription or order a slipcase ) . each issue includes a tear-out activity ... a craft or game related to that issue 's theme . the cast of characters is fairly diverse with various races represented . and if you like your child 's reading material to be secular , this magazine fits the bill . my 4 year old and i look forward to each issue ... it 's a little expensive for 9 issues , but it 's worth it
0	i was under the impression that this was a literary magazine that would be full of fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , and literary criticism . instead i received a magazine that discusses political issues . does the magazine know what it wants to be ? they recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands . why would they if they 're becoming a political magazine ? do they want to be a news/political magazines such as time , u.s. news world report , and newsweek or do they want to be a literary magazine ? they 're doing a poor job of establishing themselves and drawing the line of what they want to be . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . of course for the atlantic staff , turning the magazine into a political direction will probably bring them more sales . i do n't think that reading and literary magazines are dead by any means but the format needs to be revamped so that people will want to read it .
1	in the world of gaming , there are specialized magazines for each system ( playstation magazine , xbox mag , etc . ) , most of which suck because they only report on ( duh ) games on their respective systems . others , like electronic gaming monthly , encompass most systems but only do it half-assed , not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it . then , there 's gameinformer . there are many things that set gameinformer apart from many other `` gaming '' magazines : 1 ) they have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play . if the game sucks , they say so ; if it 's an awesome game , they 'll tell you about it . 2 ) matt helgeson ( senior gaming editor ) and the other editors actually inform you about the game 's most necessary attributes : its esrb rating ( e to m ) , their rating for the game ( from 1 to 10 ) , and a brief introduction to the game 's faults and successes . best of all , however , they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock . these are just some of the reasons that gameinformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market . i have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only , and i hope my review has explained why .
1	an outstanding magazine even if all you wish to do is look at the pictures . great ideas and for a great price
1	the london review of books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature , the arts , culture , history , politics , philosophy published in the world today -- it now beats the ny review of books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the tls back in the dust . if you want to get your bearings in the world of culture and politics , this is must reading . denis jonnes washington d. c./kitakyushu , japan
1	w.. w is an excellent magazine ( excellent + very big ) although i must say to ensure you dont want waste your money.. w isnt for everyone ! this is such a good magazine though , i 've being reading it for such a long time . and in my opinion every issue is worth it . just to give you an idea of what w is all about..its about : *amazing high fashion spreads and fashion updates , etc etc *a backstage pass into the lives of americas high society *informative articles , offering opinions by the writer and the readers of the magazine *amazing and very unique interviews of celebs and other upcoming people whos names will be very well-known in a very short time . overall , if you like reading about high-fashion , and the lives of the rich and famous and indulging in abit of luxury , then w is definetly the magazine for you .
1	agree with the other reviewer , nothing like this in the states . no country kitch , no traditional , just straight modern , clean , pretty rooms/homes . it 's expensive , that 's the part that stinks . i buy it at $ 7.50 an issue , but it 's worth it . b/c it 's modern , there is a lot of minimalism , which you very rarely see in u.s. magazines . i keep every copy of this . they are always good for reference , i read them each dozens of times over .
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year . the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid , innocuous , 'insights ' it offered . this magazine has no redeeming social value .
1	this is a great magazine for those who wish to learn more about w.w. ii . it has many personal stories and interviews . every issue is packed . i subscribed to it..
1	popstar would be a great choice for concerned parents wondering what subscription to get for their ten-year-old kid , because unlike many celebrity news magazines ( even more teen-oriented ones ) , popstar is most likely the safest one out there . it covers a great deal of celebrities that are n't huge yet , and tons of stuff about favorites like lindsay lohan , hilary duff , raven , mary-kate and ashley olsen , the cast of harry potter , good charlotte , etc . there are thousands of pinups and huge posters in each issue that will satisfy any music/tv/movie fan . another thing i like about this magazine is that it 's legnthy ( each issue is 100 pagees ) , and there are n't any advertisements , either . the magazine has frequent exclusive interviews and pictures with celebrities that ca n't be found anywhere else . additionally , popstar covers the month 's best cds , new artists to watch out for , embarrasing moments stories , horoscopes , a bit of fashion and beauty , and more . for those who want an interesting , informational celeb magazine , popstar would be a great choice
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift . i paid for it on nov. 21 '05 . it is now feb. 19 '06 , and my daughter has not yet recieved her christmas present ! i will never again place an order with amazon ! barnes and noble has proved to be very efficient and worthy of my business . i will at this point try to get my money back from this company , and my daughter can purchase the magazine and all the missed issues off the newsstand
1	super chevy is a on top magazine they keep you well informed on helpful info for building hot engines & amp ; doing it with value in mind , they are also helpful with visual pictures in a step by step sequence with many hints that the average person can understand . i also like it when they show different parts & amp ; electrical pictures for building a car from start to finish the more information the better , this is true for transmissions & amp ; rear ends . also like all the great hands on how to do it from people in the know , thanks !
0	i found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing . that 's about it . this mag seems to be biased towards certain products & amp ; manufacturers . they neglected to open my eyes wider . the reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they do n't give credit to smaller , better , less-well-known companies and technologies . all the info is pretty basic for intro users , but if that 's what you are interested in ... then this is a great non-comlicated publication
1	i find it to be the least biased among pc computer magazines . unlike most of its competitors , computer reviews are typically supported by objective benchmarks . this magazine does not generally cover pc components such as cases , fans , and motherboards . but it is immensely useful for their reviews of brand peripherals ( eg , lcd , printers , graphics cards ) and computers
1	this magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in new york city that week . the magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it , you can just skip to the section you 're interested in . there 's a whole city out there to discover and tony can help point you in the right direction
0	gd usa is a monthly magazine targeted at , and available free to , professionals within the graphic design community . it consists overwhelmingly of promotional material - advertising , company profiles , personal profiles , and so on . if you are not in the business , you will find little of interest here . if you are in the business , you can get the magazine free from their website
1	this paper offers a wonderful broad perspective , and great national coverage . does n't take too long , but always has plenty to read . every american should read this paper . and every adult should check out the `` new sex now '' dvd
1	i have been a subscriber for years and have grudgingly paid more and more every year for my subscription . still i have always loved pw and look forward to my weekly edition ... although i do not always receive my magazine in a timely manner . whether because i live on the west coast or if it 's just the mail , i do n't know . sometimes it arrives way into the following week , sometimes closer to the beginning of the week . i still find the magazine valuable , but have to say the following : for a magazine directed at the publishing trade i find it ludicrous that there are so many typos in the reviews as well as the text . who is doing the proof reading here ? there is a new format that has updated the look , but i miss the best seller lists being in the back of the magazine . now they 're somewhat in the middle and one definitely ca n't just easily flip to them . also , the q 's with authors are so stupidly placed in issues which do n't contain the review of the author 's book who is being interviewed . instead , there is a reference date to the issue said book was reviewed in . it 's frustrating to read the q and then not be able to see the review of the author 's book in the same issue . i guess the publisher thinks people keep the magazine at least 4 weeks or issues just lie around the house or office and pile up . i like the `` deals '' columm and `` hollywood reader '' column , but my very favorite section is the author profile . i am curious tho about the age of some of the writers in this publication ... i 'd also like to know how the magazine and the editors decide what book should get a starred review . sometimes i 'm astounded as to what gets starred . the website , which you get full access to when you register as a subscriber to the magazine , is easy to use . even before i receive my issue in the mail , i can see the latest issue on line
1	conde nast traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees . the magazine is geared mostly to north america and europe . it tells where to eat , shop or be seen on the two continents . for example , an article will inform the reader of a new five-star sushi restaurant in florence , italy . thus , if you plan to travel to florence for sushi ( not michelangelo ) , this is the magazine for you . it is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler , for the pictures are gorgeous .
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out .the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole . it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections ' of the country . the reporting itself is clear and very readable . the paper lacks weight and depth . it has a lot of variety in its features , and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable . it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers .
0	ct is quick to call the collection agency . they require written `` opt-out '' notification from the subscriber that the subscription is to be terminated . beware , these guys are a credit risk . too much trouble for what is otherwise a good magazine
0	i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything about it . i was very disappointed . not enough recipes . the recipes that are included are not really ones that i would use .
1	the magazine provides its readers with immediate access to startling developments in science , technology and medicine with a renewed emphasis on how those breakthroughs affect their world . the world is evolving faster than ever . new technologies are influencing every aspect of our lives . an award-winning , general interest magazine devoted to the world of science and technology.for three out of my four years in high school , i kept up with discover . it allowed me to be geeky without overstressing my brain on very technical , field-specific jargon that i 'd find in journals like scientific american . i learned a lot from that magazine . i learned such and such , and my best guess is from discover . i usually do n't retain fine details , but the pull quotes and headlines from that magazine stick with me.discover is my science magazine of choice . look for subscription deals and you 'll be a happy geek like me , too .
1	i really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it ! every parent should read this magazine ! really good activites and advice .
1	i 've been subscribing to paste for over a year now , and it 's a great magazine . i agree with what others have said about the writing : the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists . there are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music , and the sampler cd and dvd are worth the subscription price all by themselves . it 's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise . if you love music and are spending a small fortune on cds , this magazine is for you . my only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy , with tons of small print jammed onto each page , often with a background picture/design behind the words , which makes it a chore to read . i would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages . then again , i 'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic
1	i love vogue living from australia . i do n't know what it is about countries outside of the us but their design sense is more pure and absolutely more creative . this magazine rings all the right bells with me and i have never throw a copy away . if you crave style that is different from every other magazine that is sold on the mainland us i would say spring the extra couple bucks for this gem
0	regardless of the quality of the magazine , it is really annoying to see oprah on every single cover ! and to make it worst , she does not pick `` regular oprah shots '' , instead you look at every issue 's front cover and ask yourself `` how did they take that picture ? she does n't even look like her ! '' it 's as if oprah is telling all of us `` see how i can look like ? '' every month is just a new testimony from oprah , that money does do wonders . on the top of that , oprah 's personal thoughts , things , favorites , ideas , even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement . i still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article , but the bottom line is the question : is this a magazine or a show off ?
1	as a renter of a new house that is completely empty , i needed some ideas for decorating every room . i 'm thrilled with home magazine ! it 's got creative ideas for everything from table lamps to kitchen remodels . and they always list websites for where to buy the products right on the page by the product ! it does n't get much easier than that .
1	when i bought pc world at a store , the cover looked appealing . it had an advice on how to surf the internet trouble free . so i brought it home and started reading it . i was amazed ! i have never read a magazine cover to cover before , but i read this one word for word . this mag is filled with tons of reviews of best software and new gadgets . it also has unbiased articles written in a balanced simple english and technical language on computing in general . perhaps the best part about the magazine is the cd they include with it . it is filled with pc world recommended software that will make your life much easier . if you never heard of pc world , you do n't know what you 're missing . go to the nearest store and ask for the copy . you 'll be glad you di
1	great magazine could n't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs . icreate also introduced a great pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of proapps such as final cut pro , photoshop , mdvd studio pro etc . now here 's the thing , i 'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year . me , or anyone i know with a subscription have n't recieved the mag for months , and there has been no contact from the people who handle the subscription despite zillions of e-mails . so be careful , get the full story before you hand over any money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! check the web for similar storries , you will find the
1	yes , the magazine is great ... but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads . they will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters . and occasionally , you get a big stinky aol disk in with your issue . kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios . welcome to the mainstream media
1	when the publishers of my all-time favorite women 's fitness magazine ( muscle fitness hers ) decided to stop producing it , i had to find a suitable alternative . while it 's not as `` meaty '' as muscle fitness hers , it 's a good , inspiring read . it devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup ( and ug , even a few celebrities ) , but overall i would recommend it ... at least until something better comes along
1	i have subscriptions to a few magazines , and i have to say , seventeen , is the one i 'm always looking forward to . this magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips , how to be healthy ( not just stick thin ! ) , tips for school , fun ( not very useful , but fun ) stuff on guys and love , teen stories , and important information to be aware of . it 's fun , but also informing . the models are normal girls , and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear , but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who 's size 4 , 8 , or 16 . many styles from girly to goth are shown , not just one . the clothing and accessories are also affordable , and can be found at stores in your nearby mall . seventeen is n't all fashion . it 's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life . it 's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are , and not what you are n't . i 've used some of the tips on health , skin care , feeling good , and make-up , and you know what ? they do work , and are actually helpful ( ***gasp*** ) . the celebrity interviews are very good , and such that you can relate to them . the stories about things in teens ' lives are also very good- some are sad , but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there . it 's a wonderful magazine . it does n't have an overload of ads like teen vogue or elle girl , while still including fashion ( though i will say not as much as these two mags , because these two are almost entirely all how to look good ) . seventeen however , has a bit more fashion than teen people , teen people having more stories and such ( though it is right up there with seventeen ) . seventeen is a happy medium . it 's an awesome magazine
1	i ordered back issues of this magazine from an ebay dealer in the uk after the spring 2006 issue came out and i am sold not just on burda plus but on berlin fashion designers as well- the women , anyway , make lovely , flowing but not `` girly '' clothes that are very wearable - think eileen fisher or flax but with darker , richer colors , fibers and textures , slightly more `` fit '' and more interesting shapes in a wider variety -- not just the same few repeated again and again . clothes for the decades , not the season -- and the patterns are here ! at least some of them , from designers like evelyn brandt , doris strietch ( and another berliner ( female ) whose name escapes me at the moment , but whose clothes i deeply admire . ) the fit is better than most american pattern companies - especially pants . if you make one garment from each issue the subscription has more than paid for itself . good info on sizing patterns up or down in the back issues i recently received - keeping the proportions if using a `` petite '' or a `` tall '' pattern if you are neither . pattern directions themselves can be less than enlightening , though - perhaps `` non-fluent '' would be the best description of their translation . and the breathless tone ( lots of exclamation points ! ! ! ! ) of the editorial content seems a bit much for such `` smart '' clothes , but we 're not buying this for the elegancce of the writing ! another reviewer complained of delivery delay . this is only published in january and july . if you missed subscribing in time for the last issue and the print run is gone , you have to wait until the next one pubs . and the print runs do sell out . as i can attest
0	they allowed me to try one issue before i paid for the subscription . after i read the first issue , i decided to cancel . there are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written , for example , you could n't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are . the rest of the magazines are all advertisements , which you can get for free from the internet ( or just anywhere )
0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer . they might as well call this the robb report . they only test highend cars and the `` best '' ones are the ones that go 0-60mph the quickest , not ride nice or get good mpg
1	best damm biker rag . barr-non
1	you bet , this one is . there are only a few mac oriented magazines out there and they all wish they could be this well written . this is a large format magazine and each issue is filled with a series of how-to articles that i consider the best written , best illustrated and easiest to follow . i can slog through some fairly dull reading but this is the magazine i would give to my wife / daughter / co-worker to explain how to use ichat , hook up an isight camera , customize ical , get started with safari and so on . they review many new software tittles and the latest hardware goodies . since it is a magazine , the reviews are very current . each issue comes with a cd and they are starting to include pdf copies of prior issues , great for reference
0	the only reason i subscribe is i found a free subscription somewhere . the magazine had some interesting articles but most of the time they are just completely wrong . one example was a preview to last years nfl draft . they talked up terrell suggs in a long article to the point he was definetely going at the latest third even with the quaterback needy bengals and the lions who really wanted rogers were finding it hard to take a pass at him . where does he end up ? going to the baltimore ravens . not even his homestate team the cardinals wanted him . another example is the cover of the their college football preview . they picked auburn to be their national champions . i do n't follow college football enough to understand , but i know auburn lost its first two games and does n't look much like a team vying for a national championship . i 'm not saying that sports illustrated is perfect and their picks are always accurate , but they seem to me to get a better grasp on sports . yes sports illustrated has ads , but looking through my last issue it does n't seem that the sporting news has any less . it takes a while till you get at least two consecutive non ad pages . it seems like they both have the same amount . and even if one had more ads than the others is it that hard to really turn the page ? are you that lazy ? the articles are the important thing and not many people say that the ones in sporting news are better . i 'd like to hear what some people thought were so nonsports related in sports illustrated . i personally have n't seen anything non sports relat1ed . yes they have reviews of the occasional sports themed book and movie but they are usually short just letting fans know whether its worth it
1	nylon magazine is amazing , with a creative touch no other magazine has . based in the great nyc , this magazine oozes creative sophitcativeness , originality , and a sarcastic charm with amazing fashion , art , and espicially music . the photography is pure genius and the layout will just want you to flip through the magazine again and again . witty journalist contemplate to the magazine 's superiority , who are honest , witty , charming and sarcastic . if you have any taste for underground culture come pick up nylon magazine now
0	i was one of entertainment weekly 's charter subscribers way back in 1990 . it started out great -- a different , intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage . but financially , things were shaky , so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience . i could n't blame the editors . it helped them reach the needed tipping point , and they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus , and i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew has fallen off a cliff . it has become entirely superficial and shallow , with hardly any substance at all . the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format . i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience . so , i 've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be
0	i found cat fancy magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners . i 'm also very unimpressed with their cat channel online board they advertise in cat fancy and can not recommend it to others . they seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it . also cat fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine , but if you go onto amazon , you can get a renewal rate of almost half the cat fancy renewal price . so i have come to the conclusion that between the cat fancy magazine , their poor online cat channel board and the high renewal rate cat fancy charges , they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members .
1	this magazine would be a delightful reading experience for a wide audience . it appeals the *most* to busy young adults , who are looking for quick , healthy , easy-to-make delicious meals , which they just *might* want to spice up with an occasional adventurous new taste in wine recommendations . there is a wonderful column on `` new flavors '' . in the june 2004 issue it is `` lemongrass '' . in the july issue it is `` miso '' . there are fine recommendations for new restaurants in exotic locales , such as , bermuda or sao paolo , brazil . also included are foods for special holidays , such as in june for `` father 's day '' . naturally , grilling is the `` haute cuisine '' on this auspicious day . the recipes for `` salmon nicoise sandwiches '' and `` tuscan baby back ribs '' are mouth-watering ... the `` fast food '' section is loaded with tasty healthful salads , such as , `` spicy chicken , avacado , and mango salad '' and `` turkey and green bean stir-fry with peanuts '' . some grilling suggestions include , `` tandoori pork with gingered mango salad '' and `` korean-style chicken wraps '' . needless to say , all the food is tempting and the recipes are not too difficult to accomplish , provided one is already familiar with cooking techniques . overall , the emphasis on this magazine is *not* on wine but instead on food . for a change of pace , the june issue has a very fine article on `` vodka '' . in the july 2004 issue there is a superb article by robert parker called , `` australian wine guide '' . the regular wine column covers `` german reisling '' by richard nailey . most impressively , the july issue introduces the reader to `` america 's best new chefs of 2004 '' . of course , each selects a recipe to share . this magazine is loaded with unique articles for the adventurous cook and aspiring gourmand . highly recommended . erika borsos ( erikab93
0	a friend once said to me , `` if you want a glossy that is a no brainer then get vogue ! '' how right she is , despite having glorious photography , fashion models that dare n't stand sideways or you would n't be able to see them and the occasional good article in it , i have to admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants to be the voice of fashion , the voice of the high brow media but its clientele are the likes of you and me , ordinary people who ca n't afford to live the high life they are portraying on its gloss filled pages . personally i 'd rather spend my money on a movie ticket , i get to see a good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i do n't have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demons that haunt a particular actor 's life , i 'm just interested in enjoying myself for a couple of hours before i go back to my hard working life in the real world . vogue is trying to sell me a dream that i do n't really want to buy into , never had a penchant for selling my soul to the devil , it 's gets two stars though because the photography is really superb , shame about the rest of it though
0	calling all brighton mums ! this magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design , smothered in advertising for crisp , white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops . a pretty lousy effort as australia 's top selling interior design magazine . though designed for the wealthy mainstream brighton market , vogue interiors will satisfy anyone who does n't quite know what the colour brown will `` work '' with . vi 's current editor is david clark , art director is anna utzon and interior design editor is matt page
1	smithsonian says it like it was , albeit short and sweet . without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications , smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship , especially if it departs from traditional concepts . their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh , without cut and paste from the time-honored sources . their article on gavrilo princip , the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand , shook me to the core . thanks smithsonian .
0	while the magazine itself is a great magazine ( very informative ) you can buy it through the cards that come in the magazine for far less money . do n't get ripped off . buy it through the magazine
0	once thought of as a women 's health magazine , cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy . at one point , cosmo seemed to be a must-have , along with water and oxygen . more and more lately , it seems that the magazine is posing the question `` how can we survive on only water and oxygen , and still be sexy while we do ? '' ocassionally , a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics , but few and far between . they do n't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article , is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself , thinking that she must conform to some `` heroin-chic '' fad . fun fearless female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great . it shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful , but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world , without needing a man . if the magazine featured more of these things , maybe it would be worth my subscription fee . but tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover not featuring the phrases `` mind-blowing sex '' , `` how to satisfy ( insert breathing life form here ) '' , or `` barely-there '' , which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore , but everything . this is n't a magazine about women 's health anymore . it 's all about how to keep your man happy , while still conforming to social standards in fashion , weight , and financial standings . i 'm sorry , but the `` girl on a budget '' ca n't afford a $ 430 skirt , or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $ 300+ . cater more to the real woman ; not the one who only cares about her relationship status , pant size , and bank account
1	if you are interested in off-the-grid living or any form of alternative energy , home power magazine is a must read
1	from a subscription point of view ( about $ 12/yr directly ) this magazie is a decent value . while half the information is fluff ( looking back - 15 years of innovation , etc . ) there is some timely relevant information hard to find easily in a consolidated way . the focus is not just on laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals , pdas , mobile phones among others . there is some opinion ( riaa vs sirius ) but the focus seems to be vendor/advertiser driven . for example , the cover story of the mar 2006 issue is on first four core duo notebooks . they review centrino duo notebooks from acer , dell , gateway and hp . they run benchmark tests and provide charts , etc . fairly useful info . except they do n't give the information consistently . the weight of dell laptop is not even mentioned while those of others is . they do mention a few cons for each notebook but do it gently without a strong opinion . two of the four systems reviewed are selected as editors ' choice . the other two still are rated well . there is no single table that compares them all in a single view . you get the feeling , they were trying to please the advertisers and avoided any direct head-on comparision between multiple products . i disagree with their choices as well . how could the editors ' choice be a 6.6lbs laptop from acer that has an average battery life just because it offers some value ? in the same mar 2006 , there is a review of windows treo 700w ; a showdown between slim phones moto razr v3c and samsung mm-a900 ; a short test of nokia 's pocket internet appliance and kodak 's first dual-lens digicam ; wifi routers ; list of restaurants for business travelers ; etc . for a $ 1/month , i recommend this to anyone who travels a lot and is looking for a quick update on the mobile computing world . if you want in-depth technical info , stick to toms hardware or other web sites
1	this is a magazine for alix mautner . richard feynman wrote qed , in part , because he wanted to write a series of lectures that would make quantum electrodynamics understandable to his friend , mautner . science news does the same with geology , ecology , medicine , physics , chemistry , and other sciences . it does it by reviewing , in understandable terms , the theory , the experiments , the conclusions , and the alternative ways to interpret the conclusions . it projects the cutting edge of science by reviewing not only the published science , but also the science reported in scientific gatherings . since the flesch-kincaid grade level of the writing is approximately 11 , or 1 more than national geographic , it is perfect for the literate masses from age 13 up . today 's issue included an article on whether honeybees can discriminate between human faces ( really ! ) . the answer is ... usually . and the cover story was on the chemistry of beer . the magazine is published 51 weeks a year , and subscribers also have access to web resources including references , extended articles , and the archive . science news is the best thing to happen to current science news reporting since ... sliced honey bread , delivered to my face
0	flipping through the pages of writer 's digest at a local bookstore , i found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting , especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer . so i decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that i realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine . since i have subscribed online directly through wd 's website in jan 2005 , i have received only a few issues . in the first few months for almost half a year , i received no issues at all . it was only later then when i e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me . the annoying thing is that even though i have e-mailed wd a few times on this problem , they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription . how does this tackle the root of the problem ? if they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service , they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers ' option . ironically , i received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter . logistic problems aside , the magazine does have its plus points . in the issues , there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing , but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well . occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work , their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration . all this from a range of authors from a range of genres . essentially , the business of writing is also not left out . however , the magazine is not one fraught without problems . the problem with wd is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered . each article though containing valuable tips on writing , does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented . in addition , because of its range , it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently , which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers . sometimes , it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues . this for example , can be seen in the amount of publishers ' addresses that they offer . at most , each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses . there is nothing wrong with this , but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a writer 's market collection of publishers ( and agencies ) addresses collected into one ? and ironically again , the same company does publish a 'writer 's market ' collection which is of excellent quality annually . that said , the same problem - the lack of information and depth , is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well . to make matters worse , every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times . writers want to organise their time and information , not add on to it . if you want are thinking of subscribing to wd , do consider the alternatives that are currently available . writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think . however , if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life , than this magazine might be for you . but do your research first
1	i am not the only to think jose da silveira is not straight . now that his carrer is back on track , the affirmation of his gayness would be terribly damaging . i believe this is the reason this yvette linton-smith has been hired to go along for a while to make sure ppeople , mainly women can look at him with envy and desire and continue supporting him . imagine what would happen to his carrer if he turned out to be gay ... .just your little detective . susi
1	this magazine does hold my kids ' interest , and i feel it was worth the money for one year . the articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects . however , i probably wo n't renew because i feel the regular national geographic magazine is also suitable for kids and better in the long run . i guess it would be good for parents to screen and limit use of the regular magazine with regards to the very young , but for the most part kids are exposed to relevant current issues at school and in the media anyway , so the issues and photos of national geographic magazine are not too adult or inappropriate .
1	i am originally from germany and enjoyed your magazine over there . so glad to have finally found it here and again can enjoy your needlework patterns , iron-on transfers and knit fashions . your directions are clear and easy to follow . thank you for a wonderful magazine ! gerda
1	if i could only subscribe to one magazine , i 'd pick marie claire in a heart beat . it offers everything other women magazine have , including love life , diet , beauty , fashion and celebrity . in addition , marie claire focuses on issues larger than the domestic us . being an educated young woman , i am interested in real life issues that other magazines tend to ignore . not only does marie claire have the guts to discuss issues that are hard to read at times ( domestic abuse , prostitution in asia , weight discrimination , etc . ) , but they actually tell you how you can help . by listing numerous websites and phone numbers along with their article , it allows me to research the topic further and makes taking action just that much easier . the cover of marie claire may not look any different than any other women magazine , but open it up and i guarantee you will see a difference
0	do not buy this magazine ! for any price , it is too expensive . marie claire has harassed me repeatedly to pay for my subscription . it was paid for in advance thru amazon . i have sent them copies of my amazon receipt twice . they are reporting me to a credit agency for non-payment . avoid them , avoid them . they are scam artists and will falsely and with malice destroy your credit rating .
0	i worked there briefly and they 're rude and obnoxious and have no class . i would n't be surprised if some of the stories they 're accusing of making up are true . they deserve to be sued and stopped . all of them are repulsive , i 'm glad i got out when i did !
0	this magazine just dares people to pick the most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . `` town country '' is an extremely old money venture , and while it does have some good and useful articles ( and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford , ) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly . `` town country '' was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture , two areas i have great interest in . as an applicable aside , when i read a list of tips in the offshoot `` town country travel '' publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights , i realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class , ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to europe or asia costs . as i mentioned , there are some good articles , and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like `` town country travel '' that are eminently more readable ( although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast , etc . ) i will say that the photography is always good , and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like to be seen reading this magazine . despite having occasionally worthwhile features , i find `` town country '' to be excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have , whether it is fashion , society , or travel .
1	after having subscribed to peterson 's photographic for several years , i 'm now hooked on this new magazine and am going to let the old subscription lapse . i 've gotten tired of all the articles targeted at beginners . digital photo pro digs into the meat of photography a little deeper . some examples of articles which i 've enjoyed are discussions of how digial imaging sensors work and how ink jet printers work . in the most recent issue is a good article on using the unsharp mask in photoshop . also , i 've enjoyed the large section on new products in each issue . one caveat is that there is some nudity . you may or may not find this objectionable ( my wife is in the former category : ) . also , there is usually an article on glamour photography or glamour photographers in each issue . even if this is n't your cup of tea , there is still good stuff to learn in those articles . the magazine is beautifully published with very high quality paper and printing . it 's also nice and big . www.jpwphoto.co
1	this is not your tipical music mag with all the coorporate mainstream bull . this mag turns you on to what is up and coming in the music world and is a great tool for finding new music . i recomend it to everyone that enjoys good music
0	playboy made a mark in its day about 40 years ago . today it is a totally unneeded magazine . its concept of a mixture of quality articles mixed in with naked photos so that the reader `` will not feel quilty looking at the photos because he wanted to read an interesting article '' is actually quite goofy . the end result is that the articles and the photos are lukewarm
0	this magazine is all puff -- if you 're looking for honest and insightful reviews , this is not your read . however , if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them , this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue
1	people is the most incredible magazine . the writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber , but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests . no matter what this magazine always makes friday a great day . i feel the best part about people magazine is the fact that they give you special issues , like 50 most beautiful people , sexiest man alive , and eligible bachelor . you get a variety highlights in each people issue . you will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest . a section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released . the passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages , births , divorces , deaths , injured , or convicted . finally , i love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting . the only bad part about people magazine is that most people , just like myself , buy the issues to read about celebrities . but you also get the human interest stories which do n't seem to interest everyone . now i do not have a subscription , but i read every issue , whether i buy them myself or read the magazine at work . i would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up
1	equipment , technology , technique and clothing : this magazine has it all . any tip that helps the amateur photographer capture and improve his or her scenic , travel and wildlife images can be found within its monthly pages
1	at least as far as the magazine itself is concerned , but cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage , email , and a ton of other things . all in online is definitely worth checking out on a regular basis , however . i just read two hardcopy issues when i was in vegas and i liked the features , pro coverage , interviews , and book reviews . should you be miles from a nearby cardroom and have a jones to advance your knowledge then you can do so rather passively by reading a publication that closely follows the pro game
1	if you are looking for more opinion than straight reporting and stats rather than highlights , tsn is your sports magazine . years back , tsn was seemingly slated to go the way of sport magazine ; one that could n't find a niche in the internet and cable era , which ultimately would spell its demise . it also took tsn to take a body blow from usa today - when its baseball weekly cut into readership - and overhand rights by espn the magazine to find its way . tsn is truly a survivor . the in-season reporting is not based on editor 's deciding what 's hot . those seeking out quick hits - for example - on auto racing do n't have to wait for the indy 500 or the nascar chase for information . my biggest criticism is the reliance on lists - the best of , the worst of , etc . - that tend to become major stories when certain sports are ready to crank up for the year . granted , many radio-talkers will pick up on the lists - and oftentimes give the compilers time to gab about it - but these features ultimately fall into a `` lazy week '' of gathering news . overall , though , tsn is better than ever and has a product that any sports fan would find informative .
0	this is a good magazine for the home cook that wants to branch-out from the standard family circle or good housekeeping no risk recipes . my big problem with this company is once they 've got your contact information , you will receive more junk mail than you thought one company could generate ; hawking every single publication they produce , relentlessly . i stopped subscribing and it took a year to stop receiving their snail spam ; and there 's no way to 'opt out ' onlin
0	but if they do n't send you the magazine , then there are no way that you can contact the publisher about it . i did n't get the magazine after about first four issues . first , i did n't notice that i was n't receiving my issues , but after three months , i found out and tried to contact the publisher about it . they do n't have e-mail to contact them , but only automated phone number . if you call there and waste about 5 minutes to reach section `` i did n't get my last issue '' , then you get about $ .60 refund . no further explanation or guaranty my next issues . and i 'm still not getting any issues . if you go to ripoff website , you can find the publisher was registered as ripoff company
0	this is a yuppie magazine for people with endless bank accounts and nothing to do with their money . what 's more is i did n't see a thing that had anything to do with actual gardens !
1	i recommend this magazine to really learn techniques to improve your running level . there is not alot of filler in this small magazine . i find that this is the magazine i do n't circulate with friends because i like to keep the articles for future reference . i learn something new each time
0	i was under the impression that this was a literary magazine that would be full of fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , and literary criticism . instead i received a magazine that discusses political issues . does the magazine know what it wants to be ? they recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands . why would they if they 're becoming a political magazine ? do they want to be a news/political magazines such as time , u.s. news world report , and newsweek or do they want to be a literary magazine ? they 're doing a poor job of establishing themselves and drawing the line of what they want to be . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . of course for the atlantic staff , turning the magazine into a political direction will probably bring them more sales . i do n't think that reading and literary magazines are dead by any means but the format needs to be revamped so that people will want to read it .
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful , with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships , i found that customer service was very dissapointing . i missed an issue back in october , and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed . it is now march , and i still have n't received my replacement . just a heads up !
0	( pseudo ) scientific american 's treatment of lomborg 's `` the skeptical environmentalist '' is nothing short of disgraceful . with this blunder , sa has seriously damaged their own credibility and exposed how politically motivated they really are . it is indeed sad that `` science '' has come to this . please visit greenspirit dot com for more information on their bully tactics when faced with what should be openly embraced in science : dissenting opinion . i guess that by making increasing sensational and apocalyptic claims about the environment they think they can sell more magazines - clearly on this point they are right , which is why the magazine 's title , `` scientific american '' , is indeed fundamentally ironic . `` scientific american is behaving in a manner that is both unscientific and un-american . they should be promoting the free exchange of ideas but instead they are threatening scientists with lawsuits for daring to question their opinions . this reflects the unbridled conceit that permeates the extreme environmental movement today . they are convinced the world is coming to an end and no amount of facts or statistics will sway them from their self-righteous dogmatism .

0	i have about two to three years of knit n style ( 2001 - 2003 ) magazines , and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a cardigan pattern to knit for myself . i have n't found a single one . all of the patterns have serious faults : drop shoulders , ( totally unacceptable ) little or no armhole , neck and/or shoulder shaping . most sleeves have little or no cap . and , worst of all , they are all made in five or more pieces . have n't any of these `` designers '' heard of elizabeth zimmerman ? i was going to give the lot to the library , but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place . if you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people , why do n't you teach them the proper way to knit ? young people are smarter than you think
0	this magazine seems most interested in promoting books , etc . that it has a financial interest in -- most notably lately the south beach diet . prevention and it 's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads . too bad , because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition , weight loss , exercise and natural remedies that is n't influenced by it 's publishing partners and advertisers . skip this one , and try self or health for a more well-rounded look at women 's heath needs
1	one of the most erudite music magazines on the market ! several in depth articles in each issue . extensive reviews that do n't fudge - candid and critical , and lots of pings to bands you 've heard before , when reviewing those it 's likely you have n't . the only criticism i can think of , is that it 's become so big and thick with ads that it 's gotten harder to get thru ! but many of the ads display great graphic design , even they are fun
0	i am utterly disappointed in the direction that gamepro has taken over the past two years . i actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year , but came back to the 20 issues for $ 10 at their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but the magazine is really bad . one thing i laugh is , the retro corner . they have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before , and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago . i think the most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue was around 100 . and do n't try to tell me they 've lost 40 pages in advertising . too bad on-line reviews and websites , are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines . i 'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life . or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low , i ca n't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort . you guys were pretty good 5 years ago , but you 've gone to pot these past two years ! i 'm talkin ' to you watchdawg ! ! ! you guys are suckin ' lately ! ! ! mc white said : you guys are suckin ' ! !
1	a front page title : is your health making you fat ? it was related to some kind of hormones that causes a series of symptoms and make a woman to gain weight waist up
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life . instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images , people we will never meet , and in many cases people who have very little going for them . does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything , or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence ? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j.lo is engaged ( in order to get on the cover of another magazine ) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns
1	this magazine is pretty . i am not that interested in long articles , so the fact that this magazine has alot of pictures helped .
1	this is the third time i have purchased handyman magazine for family members as gifts . this time , i misunderstood how to gift the item . unfortunately , i did not have a second chance to send the magazine to a family member as a christmas gift . after calling , the only recourse i was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes ( because it is coming to me instead of my son in atlanta ) , call and cancel the order and reorder . unfortunately , doing this , it will not reach my son in time for christmas . i would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me , but send as a gift
1	first , i received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives , and gives , and gives . this magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen , on the grill , around the house , in my garden , in the state as well as all through the south for traveling . being a woman who moved from the detroit suburbs to florida so i could be with ailing family , i was really a duck out of my elements . i had no idea of what was where within the state ; what are good places to visit , where are some of the great attractions outside of orlando , the keys , and the everglades and who does what where . in this magazine , there are sections devoted just to florida ( which i suspect they do for each state per subscription ) -- what to plant when , what festivals are going on , what 's hot and what 's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state i live in . and that 's not all ... not only do i get to learn more about where i am today , i can explore and learn about where i 'd like to go tomorrow . one month , it 's `` welcome to alabama '' and all the wonderful gems it has to offer . another month , i am poring over beautiful georgia . a different topic ? seafood of the south . how would you like to learn about fantasic , but yet unknown , places for bargains and great finds ? now - i am also an avid cook at home - and i can not tell you how much i love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine . how many differnt ways have i learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission ! i have learned so much more about grilling , vegetable side dishes , breakfast treats and savories from all over the south , tempting , lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between . i have always known the south was the jewel of the states when it came to cooking - but w.o.w ! so much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill . and it is a great compliment to what i learn from other books , the food channel , and beyond . it speaks to where i live , what i can get down here , and what the heck plantains are anyway : - ) i love looking through many of the decorating ideas , the travel tips , and vignettes of different states , or towns , or themes . the only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than i can in the way of travel , decorating , etc . i am more simple , down-to-earth folk , and do not share much with `` decorating your summer cottage '' , or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise , or splurge excursion . sometimes , and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me i am not going to be able to relate to everything , i am not the crowd they are talking to . otherwise , this magazine is a 10 in my book : - ) well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month 's `` explorations ''
1	i read successful farming , progressive farming and backwoods home for years . they are all fine magazines . but if you want to do a little hobby farm this magazine really fits . they have a wealth of information in each copy . i 'm really impressed . it 's really targeted to those people who have five to thirty acres , a few animals and may or may not want to make a little money on this side or as minimum have fun but do it the right way . my first copy was their tractor issue . very good info . and i 'm an engineer
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market . very realistic with budgets too . it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable ( on any budget ) . i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful
1	i 've had subscriptions to just about every woman 's magazine there is over the past 8 years , but the only one i always renew is `` glamour '' . it 's less `` how-to-catch-a-man '' oriented than `` cosmo '' , less pseudo-hipster than `` jane '' and less serious than `` marie claire '' . while it 's certainly no `` ms. '' magazine , it has a lot of women-positive messages every issue , articles that are n't as sensationalistic and fear-mongering than most found in women 's magazines , and lots of fashion and beauty tips . i feel that `` glamour '' strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness -- for those of you who like a side of third-wave feminism with your fashion , i highly recommend it .
1	this is such a good mag ! i loved all the crafts , animal pics , and other cool stuff . i learned how to feng shui your room and find out what a liger looks like . the jokes are funny too . this is one : what do you get when you cross a pig with a centipede ? bacon and legs ! . they also tell you cool facts like : mona lisa has no eye brows and most in england belong to the queen . so as you see this rocks ! buy it , buy it now . -jami
0	i bought a copy of this magazine and initially enjoyed a great deal of it , but ultimately found it distasteful . it was graphically hyperactive , which became distracting and irritating , and there was something else that did n't seem quite right , though at first i could n't identify just what that was . eventually i realized that it was n't making a clear distinction between the editorial content and commerce ( items offered by companies advertizing in the magazine , workshops sponsored by the magazine , books sold by the publisher of the magazine ) . eventually i figured out that the publisher was australian . if rupert murdoch is any guide , then this magazine is coming from a tradition that does n't respect boundaries between journalism and financial gain . i ended up putting this magazine aside in distaste
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america , and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in europe . there are very few articles or artist bios . the photos are beautiful , but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there , but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous . i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90:10 . it still has wonderful fashion tips , but the ads are becoming burdonsome . in style has replaced vogue as my # 1 fashion mag , but i 'll always be a vogue reader
1	i look forward to every issue . the projects are top notch . i have subscribed to several woodworking magazines . popular woodworking is one of the best
1	this is my # 1 favorite decor magazine . it 's full of very creative ways to decorate with antique furniture and linens . the end result is classy and ecletic and something everyone could do .
1	i enjoy this magazine profusely ! it is beautifully stylized , terrific recipes and good for day dreaming too
0	when you subscribe to the wall street journal it 's like getting two newspapers : a good news reporting paper and an what at times seems like an editorial page written by sophmomores in the local young americans for freedom college rag . it 's not that i mind right-wing editorials , i 'm somewhat of a libertarian myself , it 's just that its editorial page puts ideology ahead of reason far too often for my taste . for a much better deal -- business news , all the financial quotes , much better international coverage , and excellent and concise reporting -- choose the financial times . at the moment an annual subscription is selling for $ 50 . it 's a much better publication and on saturday 's has a very fine weekend section with good book reviews and arts and culture coverage . also because the ft is based out of london the editors are much more balanced and less cowed or ideologically obedient . even if they were similarly priced the ft would be the better deal . as it is the ft costs a fraction of the price of the wsj .
1	this is the best pc gaming magazine you 'll find anywhere . it covers the lastest games and hardware . a bonus , the issue comes with a free demo disc every month . although pc games are fading out of the picture , xbox is a good way to keep them alive . this magazine covers everything you need to know . it 's the best thing to do if you want the most out of your pc . a good choice to start with is this . get this magazine , your wo n't regret it
0	this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit . it 's filled with many success stories . but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success . it 's also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , and every other ad is about franchising . i have a one year subscription and at this point i 'm bored . i 'll keep the subscription , but it 's highly unlikely that i will renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur.com . you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine , and will prove to be a great wealth of information
1	my husband and i love getting our monthly subscription . we read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered . we often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we 've read about . variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together . if you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag , check out intense games dvd , it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality . really
0	i send away for a 2 year subscription , they sent me a 1 year sub , i wrote 5 letters , sent copies of bank cheque and order form , emailed them , no response , they could care less , what more can i do ?
1	inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity . with inc. , you get timely advice on taxes , marketing , financing , and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day . probably the strongest point of inc. is the way it presents important information to readers . the authors of this magazine get directly to the point . they do n't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact . even when the news is bad , like with regulations , taxation , etc. , inc. lets you have it in a direct manner . this is good , because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts . inc. writers are direct , and i respect them for that . if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine , i can think of only two : the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that , while nice to read about , present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners . inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth . this is fine , but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground . and , every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich . again , this is ok , but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic . still , inc. is a very good publication for small business owners . it provides some good , timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns . the price to subscribe is low , too , making inc. magazine a must for owners of small , growing companies .
1	though the magazine does have the mlm and `` you to can get rich '' articles , it has validity . you can do anything if you find the right thing , something your passionate about . i 've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation , but i can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs . is n't that the main goal here ? you have to find it , no one is going to hand it to you . do the research and the work and ask for mentoring . follow up on the leads and ideas they give you . i truly enjoy this magazine . carpe diem
1	i love this magazine great travel ideas , and fun to read even if you never make the trip ! a recent issue on the yucatan really helped make our vacation there so much more interesting . we visted ruin sites we would have never seen other wise .
0	do n't purchase subscriptions from amazon or magazine express . the following are my experiences with a subscription to hiragana times from amazon . what this page does n't tell you is that the japanese magazines subscribed to on amazon are filled by a company called magazine express and are shipped seamail from japan which mean you 'll recieve every issue 8 to 10 after it 's released . i placed my order in january and , to date , have not recieved a single issue . after several phone calls , the magazine express people ( who fill the amazon subscriptions ) said they had to restart my subscription for the may issues which will take 8-10 weeks due to shipping issues . so after ordering in january , i will not receive a single issue of this uncancelable magazine until possibly in late july . very poor service . this is unacceptable for a magazine that most us japanese bookstores ( fujisan is one ) can get within a week or that you can order directly from the publisher for only a few dollars more . if i had known the shipping policy i would not have ordered and the magazine supplier , magazine express will not cancel the subscrition . i advise avoiding all amazon magazine subsriptions due to their poorly stated policies . **update , i wrote this review in june . it is now july 8th and i 've just been informed i must wait until august 15th to see if an issue arrives . i ordered the magazine on january 9th and i have had no resolution from either magazine express or amazon who provides no way to contact anyone within amazon about magazine orders . i reiterate , buying magazines from amazon if a poor idea
0	i have yet to receive my first issue and it has been over 2 months
0	i have subscribed to `` in touch '' since september last year and it 's time to renew , but i 'm not goint to ... .because this megazine is never arrived on time ( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive ) , i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service . i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining .
0	i subscribe to parents , parenting and child magazine and will renew all but the one to child . it 's full of ridiculous fashion spreads ( like i 'm going to spend $ 50 on a t-shirt for my 15-month old ) , useless travel information and near-advertising features on the newest , most expensive items i 'need ' for my child . the actual articles are no better or worse than what 's in the other mags , and i do n't find there 's nearly as much information in the magazine as in the others . as other reviewers have said , it is beautiful . however , it 's thoroughly impractical unless you 're one of those people who plan to shop at neiman 's for your child ... not that there 's anything wrong with that
1	i 've been reading men 's journal since the first issue . i 've always enjoyed its mix of content . mj interviews a wide range of interesting individuals . over the years i 've incorporated some of the workout tips from mj 's fitness pages into my workout routine . i especially enjoy reading the product reviews . the travel recommendations are always well written , if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers ( myself included ! ) . overall , men 's journal offers a great mix of well written content
0	i have been a subscriber for 15 years and still enjoy the magazine . no , its not the best magazine for music , but it is one of the best for for general pop culture news and i still occassionally find new artists because of the magazine , though i tend to find more new movies now . however , if you ever have a problem with customer service , forget it . i never got my copy of the 1,000 issue , and when i asked for a replacement , i was told they were out of that issue , but would extend my subscription by one issue . i pointed out that it was a double issue and that they are still selling back issues on their web site for $ 20 . if they do n't resolve it quick , i might just cancel my subscription , i 'm so disgusted .
1	this is the best business and money magazine out there . they cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you did n't think of .
0	i worked there briefly and they 're rude and obnoxious and have no class . i would n't be surprised if some of the stories they 're accusing of making up are true . they deserve to be sued and stopped . all of them are repulsive , i 'm glad i got out when i did !
0	it took four months to arrive and by then i was moving ...
1	actually , it deserves 4.5 stars . this is a brit magazine that offers great articles that cover classic bands ' tales as much as keeping you tuned in to the latest waves of musicians , from americana to blues to brit pop . there 's at least one excellent , long article per issue which will tell you more about bands you thought you knew about than any magazine published in usa ( check old issues for dylan 's or pink floyd 's , for instance ) . if you are old enough to remember rolling stone when it concerned itself with musicians and other artists creating new boundaries for popular art , rather than catering the current , pathetic britneyspear-nightmaremachine ... you would enjoy mojo . tip : you can get any single issue at b , borders or tower records for the same amount , that way if you do n't like it you wo n't have to mourn 100 bucks
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting , indepth coverage , etc . then , starting about 1-2 years ago , the magazine started to take a `` left '' tilt . ( i do not consider myself `` right wing '' , am registered as an independant , but do like fair balanced coverage in my news ) since the beginning of this decline , the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine . the bias has also led , as it always does , to less in-depth reporting , since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent .
0	i ordered this magazine for my kids on 2/3 and have not received it yet
0	as you can tell by the title , i 'm not enamored of this magazine . i 've been playing video games since the early 80s , and have read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons for this negative review of gamepro follow in no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points is just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) the written part of the reviews are way too short , and often are written borderline incoherantly . it 's as if they hired the proverbial 1,000 monkeys to type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews on one page . screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp . 4 . ) the number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high . once when i was bored , i counted all the ads in one issue . out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads . 5 . ) their article layouts are confusing , and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color . forget about reading it if you 're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain do n't work . i suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags , such as egm and game informer . so , in closing ... if you want a good gaming magazine , just about any magazine other than gamepro would be an improvement . many great gaming magazines have come and gone , why a turd like gamepro continues is a mystery to me
0	reason once had two things going for it . it articulated principled libertarianism , and it was a consistently interesting magazine . now its ideology is fuzzy ; certainly not consistently libertarian . it is also dull and aimless , often badly written . case in point : the current issue as i write includes a defense of the fda by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians , and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements , as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry . the `` old '' reason would never have published such a piece . nor would reason have previously published ronald bailey 's article advocating mandatory health insurance . bailey also supports the iraq war and psychiatric coercion . a bright spot continues to be the writing of jacob sullum
1	what i like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative . i have bought the last three issues and ca n't wait for the next one . this magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines . this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i have picked one up . every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry . at the beginning of this year i noticed that some of the `` popular '' or `` modern '' `` digital review '' magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now . i need to see the technology that is cutting edge or even around the corner . so far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck . good luck
0	i 've read many positive reviews of this magazine and i did receive , several months ago , a trial issue . after sending in the subscription fee , i was billed again . i wrote a note letting them know that the check had been endorsed and deposited . yesterday , i got a notice telling me my subscription had expired after one issue . i give up . it might be good , but customer service is really lousy . what a disappointment .
1	perhaps this is not the magazine for moms on a tight budget who do n't want to even daydream about designer items . but it fills a niche that the big magazines such as parents or parenting does not . as a previous reviewer stated , this is similar to instyle . you may not spend $ 200 on a pair of designer jenas in size 2t , but it 's fun to look at ... and maybe get one in a similar style on sale . and quite frankly , some parents do have the money . having expensive items does not make a child spoiled . raising a child to believe s/he is entitled to it does . there are spoiled children across all income levels
1	i had heard of `` books culture . '' i had never read it . and then a good friend from college called one afternoon and told me he was sending me a gift subscription . i 've never enjoyed a periodical this much . it has given me hope . when george w. bush was reelected the word `` evangelical '' was spoken across the country in blame . regardless of your political stance , the point is that the evangelicals were seen as stupid enough to reelect what much of the rest of the nation saw as a poor president . even today , `` evangelical '' is often used to connote backwardness or stupidity . but `` books culture '' blows this assumption out of the water . have you stumbled across another publication that will voice god-fearing perspectives on gender roles in the church , current philosophy and theology , current film and literature , politics , economics , and cultural phenomena such as the internet ? this is `` books culture 's '' most recent issue , thoughtfully done and honestly written , even when the conclusions reached seem somewhat outside of the traditional conception of things . as a subculture , we love answers . but it seems we are entering a new period of growth in our communities , one in which questions will be equally important and appropriately valued . why not begin with the tough questions ? you 'll find many of them in `` books culture . '' along p.s . dennis , if you ever read this , thanks for the subscription , bud .
1	maxim is a good magazines for adult males . i enjoy all articles and their website , too . it is more affordable subscrition
1	indispensable guide to what is happening in movies , television , books , and popular culture . comprehensive , witty , well-written and , of course , entertaining
1	although the stories and interviews in the strand are well worth reading , i think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue , and , at least in the case of john mortimer 's rumpole stories , they are taken from forthcoming books . that being said , the strand is worth the four stars i 've given it , but i would describe it as a `` coffee-table '' magazine , if such a category exists , due to its glossy pages , large size format , and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content
1	the magazine was exactly what i wanted and super cheap through amazon.com . i am happy with my purchase
0	i really enjoy how they illustrate and break down their lessons into different playing abilities . even though they break down the lessons into breaking 80 , 90 , 100 , straight hitter looking for power or power hitter looking for accuracy , they are all very helpful . no matter what your playing ability , i think any golfer can take away a little bit of advice from the playing lessons . unfortunately , golf magazine seems to be a little weak on their travel side lately though ; not really focusing on that perhaps due to the downturn in travel in recent months . i wish they would focus on that a little more like some other magazines such as t & amp ; l golf or the golfer
0	i subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction/non-fiction books - what it turns out to be is a series of editorials , premised around virtually all non-fiction . all very high-brow and frankly , quite boring . the one item worthwhile is the classifieds . i think i 'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund . i anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues , i have n't seen anything of interest
0	why is it that us weekly ca n't get a copy to me weekly ? sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue . then i 'll receive three in one week . us weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses . i 'm not buying their story or the magazine again
0	time magazine named george bush as person of the year , despite the economic , international and ecological damage he has done and will continue to do over the next four years . speak and be heard . cancel your subscription .
1	our growing row of everyday food issues has the potential to become an extremely resourceful cooking library , but where is the card catelogue ? if i want to find a particular recipe or a new recipe that i can make with a particular ingredient , i 'd have to flip through hundreds of pages . luckily , i located a downloadable everyday food index at omninerd.com . when used together , the magazine and index truly make something that can be used effectively everyday
0	i use to subscribe to shape several years ago , and then it was packed full of great work out routines , meal plans , etc for women at all levels of fitness . well . . . my last few months of shape have been a complete disappointment . i found very few pages of good genuine fitness and healthy eating advice . instead , it ranks right up with glamour in the category of magazines with the highest percentage of advertisements , nearly all of the excercise material is supposed `` quick fix '' fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations , and the healthy eating advise is absolutely elementary . there is no substance in here for women like me , the average working woman who desire to live a healthy life everyday and have limited time to commit to exercise . i want a magazine that is inspiring with a focus on living a sustained healthy lifestyle , not a joke about getting flat abs in a week with illustrations of perfectly chiseled models who obviously do not face the body challenges of average women . i 'm sorry but most women are not going to look like `` her '' after two weeks , or many months of shape 's 10-30 minute a day routines , but they sure lead you to beleive so . i highly recommend `` her sports '' it is the magazine for women desiring to live an active , day-to-day healthy life
0	i am still not receiving this magazine . and i had a gift subscription on that order , too . i 've been meaning to get in touch . thought it had been more than long enough for subscription to start
1	ok , so there are n't as many ads ( which incidentally helps its portability ) , but i 've been reading computer shopper for 6 years now , and i still find it a great read and a very valuable resource . i read every issue not only for its usefulness , but also for entertainment value - i guess you can call me a tech geek ! it 's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear - i particularly like the alfred poor 's computer cures articles and how-to guides for us `` do-it-yourselfers '' . its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative . over the past few years , i have bought several computer systems for myself and family members , thanks to advice from the experts at computer shopper and their recommendations on where to buy . so , even though i do miss the `` tech-mall '' feel of the old magazine , i 'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology
1	although i often disagree with the 'new yorker ' politically and find the writing of seymour hersh offensive i believe that the 'new yorker ' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non- fiction . i stress the non- fiction because this is what interests me in 'the new yorker now'.once it was the fiction of salinger , singer , of s.j . perelman . but in recent years it has been the writing of malcolm gladwell , adam gopin and a number of others . this is without speaking of the special feeling of class the new yorker gives , its still topnotch cartoons , the 'on the town ' feature , and the first-rate 'talk of the town ' calendar
0	frst of all i kno nothin bout this magazine but wen i came across readin this kids review sayin tat yayos nd jeezys cd were garbage forced me to write a review ... frst of all yayos cd has at least 4 hits on it.. - so seductive - eastside westside - pimpin - curious - i know you do n't love me - live by the gun and for jeezy 's album i admit there wasnt as many hits if any but the cd was one of the best albums tat came out this year w/ a new flow of southern rap and a lot of good songs ... .trapstar..my hood..bang ft t.i ... .thug motivation ... .and then what ... all good songs ... im not sayin jeezy is one of the best rappers or at the top not close..but if he comes up w/ a new album better than thug motivation 101 he will be up thea cuz of his new flow of souther rap and high energ
0	i do n't know what the heck is going on with your subscription service . i bought this magazine for my nephew back on july 9th , and he still has n't recieved an issue ! ! ! ! i am extremely disappointed with your service . it should not take this long to get a magazine
1	an excellent source of military information
0	once thought of as a women 's health magazine , cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy . at one point , cosmo seemed to be a must-have , along with water and oxygen . more and more lately , it seems that the magazine is posing the question `` how can we survive on only water and oxygen , and still be sexy while we do ? '' ocassionally , a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics , but few and far between . they do n't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article , is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself , thinking that she must conform to some `` heroin-chic '' fad . fun fearless female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great . it shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful , but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world , without needing a man . if the magazine featured more of these things , maybe it would be worth my subscription fee . but tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover not featuring the phrases `` mind-blowing sex '' , `` how to satisfy ( insert breathing life form here ) '' , or `` barely-there '' , which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore , but everything . this is n't a magazine about women 's health anymore . it 's all about how to keep your man happy , while still conforming to social standards in fashion , weight , and financial standings . i 'm sorry , but the `` girl on a budget '' ca n't afford a $ 430 skirt , or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $ 300+ . cater more to the real woman ; not the one who only cares about her relationship status , pant size , and bank account
0	to be honest , i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year , but i can hardly call myself a fan . if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag , wired is not for you , it tries too hard to be hip and trendy , but it 's group of left/lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish . wired needs to be `` rewired '' to meet the needs of the modern tech community
1	ok magazine ... .the problem ... ..we have not received one copy . can you please help with this ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
1	new york magazine is the flag bearer for `` new york is the center of the universe '' belief . it meets this goal in dishing up news , gossip , reviews and viewpoints on a weekly basis . ( how else can one get away with call shopping strategy ? ) the magazine succeeds because behind the snobbery ( example : an article on the 2nd best cities in the world ) it turns up the restaurants , stories and culture that make nyc such a fantabulous place . it 's worth diminishes rapidly , though , the further one gets from the big apple
1	i will always subscribe to this fabulous magazine . there is so much variety in each issue . i am amazed at how this magazine always get me interested in things that i have never even thought about before . and the way the articles are written , i feel like i am being entertained while i am being informed -- it 's awesome ! the mix is not just heavy subjects either -- there are always ighter-weight articles too , so i can pick up this magazine on any occasion when i 'm in any mood and i can always find something that i want to read about
1	my son has loved this magazine and is in his third year as a subscriber . he loves getting an interesting magazine in the mail each month . i love that it has good emergent reader level content this is focused so that different bits of content throughout the magazine reinforce the same concepts . my son especially loves the mini-books that come in each magazine and we generally have to make those as soon as they come . as an educator , i love that the content is at the right level and that it is actually educational in contrast to some magazines . this magazine is reasonably priced and still has no advertising . i am so thankful that the publishers have made that decision and i will keep subscribing to this until it is time to move up to ranger rick . i did have to sort out a problem with the publisher because we had recieved two gift subscriptions . i called and they were able to make the two subscriptions run back to back , so instead of two magazines each month , we have two years of subscription and they assure me that whenever it is time to move to ranger rick , we can apply any unused big backyard to the ranger rick subscription . they were very polite to me and solved my problem efficiently
0	the problem with computer shopper is , it 's neither a serious trade magazine like pc mag , or a shopper 's paradise like its former self was . if you want hardware tips , maximum pc is way better . you can find pretty much everything in computer shopper for free on the web ..
1	imagine fx is by far the most detailed magazine that i have seen that is completely loyal and devoted to scifi and fantasy digital art . whether your a technician or an admirer , this book oozez with talent and technique . the magazine is not a pro 's only book and they take a hands on approach to helping amateurs . none of the writers seem full of themselves . they all know they are in a liquid world of a digital medium where everyone learns from everyone . i highly recommend this magazine . it 's more than average price tag is worth every penny , especially when every magazine comes packaged with a disc choc-full of demos , tutorials , photoshop brushes and source art . there is no other experience that comes near the likes of imagine fx
1	men 's health is one of the most popular men 's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man . you simply have to know about fitness , dieting , supplements , fashion , gadgets , etc . the annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks . one of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities . the tips are definitely useful and yet i highly recommend in addition the bestseller `` scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex '' for the latest secrets in this area . another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy , lean and fit . there are weight loss tips , advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast . this is important part of keeping sharp appearance . overall , i can reasonably say that you will learn a lot , have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover
1	having recieved both dogfancy and dogworld , i prefer dogworld . i have found that dogfancy tends to focus more on purebreds and akc events than on the general , everyday mutts of america and what the owner of one can do with them . as an owner of a shelter mutt , i appreciate dogworld 's emphasis on the world of dogs- their nutrition , health/care , exercise , and varied news paragraphs . i especially like the column on agility training- it is as beneficial to agility persons as well as great advice for any other sport- flyball , obedience , herding/hunting trials , etc . since all sports deal with pretty much the same mental and physical aspects . i also really enjoy the different sports they highlight in each issue . the only thing about dogworld that bothers me is its series articles . if you do n't follow one series to completion you get confused and sometimes the series are more geared to the professional world ( veternarians and trainers ) than to the 'regular ' folk . dogworld gives a much more rounded view of the world of dogs and what can be done with them than dogfancy which tends to focus on more of the breeding side of the world and akc
0	all this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes . i ca n't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number anywhere to contact customer service . do n't waste your money unless you love paris hilton
0	this used to be a pretty decent music magazine . not the best that was out there , but still decent . however , rolling stone has taken a huge nose-dive in the past ten or so years . i 'm not sure i 'd even really call it a music magazine anymore . it 's more a pop-culture magazine that panders to teeny-boppers . a music magazine 's main focus should be music , but rs has over the years started including more and more articles on tv shows , movies , politics , etc and less and less on music ... especially less and less on good music . if you want a magazine on pop-culture go with entertainment weekly . it , at least , has a bit of taste here and there and does n't spout off about politics . if i want politics , i 'll read the newspaper or watch cnn . i do n't buy music magazines for politics . i buy them for music . if you want a good music magazine , this is n't the place to look anymore .
1	i love this magazine , it is my favorite of all of the scrapbook magazines out on the market . it has an all-around appeal with great and creative ideas , ways to delve into your creative mind , tips and tricks , and of course beautiful layouts to look at . this would make a great gift for a beginner or advanced scrapper .
0	it 's almost as if this magazine writes it 's stories 2 mounths in advance onces you get the `` latest '' copy it 's news that has been repeated 7961,583 times . it does however have decent posters ( that 's why it got a 2 and not just 1 ) but thats about the only thing that this magazine has to offer .
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance . aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription , i only received about 3 issues total . months went by without anything being delivered . while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful , nothing happens immediately . when planning a wedding , each and every month is precious . especially during the initial stages of wedding planning . to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting . plus , by this time most of the wedding details were finalized , the magazines i received became useless . if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date , you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride
0	i use to buy this magazine every mouth when i was much younger which was just a big waste of money all the stories and pictures can be found in any other teen bop magazine . this magazine is not for people who can actually read or understand any of the stories
1	there 's certainly a lot to hate about wine spectator - and , for that matter , wine advocate . many winemakers decry the existence of both magazines , and usually lay the blame entirely at robert parker 's doorstep for making the 100-point rating system an industry standard . wine spectator 's scores have gotten better with time , as have their articles . they 've shied away from california `` glitz '' and have looked more into food . also , the education classes that they list on their website are becoming increasingly more helpful . apparently they listened to much of the criticism and worked toward creating a more respected magazine . i think they 've done well .
1	i like this magazine and i subscribe to it ( along with cooking for two and cook 's country ) , but i do n't think it 's perfect . i like when the magazine offers a several-page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins , so i can make whatever flavor i choose and know it will turn out well . but the magazine does contain ads , despite what one reviewer claimed
1	fhm is absolutely gorgeous ! hot and sexy covers , great entertainment and fashion info . men lifestyle is discussed in this magazine . make sure that you subscribe yearly to save up cost
0	why endure the months wait . get it from the source for the same price and you 'll get a sample issue before you have top commit to a subscriptio
1	i like the different projects and items you can buy - plus they give prices and online addresses . overall i 'm quite pleased with this magazine
1	the best of the best for harley enthusiasts . well written , fair and honest . great motorcycle , accessory and clothing reviews . terrific custom bike features and excellent presentation . easy to follow tech and classics without all the girlie nonsense
0	i was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication . it was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines . over the years things changed . columnists died or moved on . editorial directions were switched . articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant in the marketplace , `` outdoor photographer '' was in the vanguard , pushing every gadget and photoshop manipulation plug-in that popped up . the magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be ) . what i thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film ( ! ? ) , a lot of large format guys , occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non-existent . at some point , my interest in this garbage lapsed before my subscription . the magazine made a once monthly trip from the mailbox to the trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . `` outdoor photographer '' impresses people who measure quality photography by whether or not the equipment used in production cost the equivalent of the gross national product of small third world countries . it offers little in the way of nutrition to a hungry mind . it 's empty calories , just making you want more and more while starving your potential . it truly is wretched .
1	after switching from mac os to windows a few years ago , i needed a pc-oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular . i took a look at pc magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content ; man , i thought , this is why mac users laugh at pc guys . then i picked up pc world at the suggestion of a friend and , wow , within minutes i filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription . pc world is good because it 's informative and useful . it covers things you want to know as a pc user . it does not slant toward hardware ( like the modders-only maximum pc ) or software , and it does n't waste space telling you why you should buy a mac g5 , which , oddly enough , pc mag tries to do . pc world is a well-balanced , informational magazine for general pc users . if you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like windows mag or other more specific magazines , but for general computing , pc world is the best . each issue is packed with stuff you can use , either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year 's party
0	i was one of entertainment weekly 's charter subscribers way back in 1990 . it started out great -- a different , intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage . but financially , things were shaky , so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience . i could n't blame the editors . it helped them reach the needed tipping point , and they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus , and i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew has fallen off a cliff . it has become entirely superficial and shallow , with hardly any substance at all . the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format . i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience . so , i 've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be
0	do n't be fooled by the cover and description , this is for a magazine only `` no dvd included ' , or should i say for a magazine containing mainly adverts for components and games . waste of time and mone
0	this is probably the best music/movie magazine out today . however , you can go to borders books or barnes and nobles and get it for $ 8.95 or something . this deal is bs
1	for those of us still a little shy , this mag is an awesome substitute ... .it 's like a shopping catalog
1	although i have yet to subscribe to aperture , what i 've heard and what little i 've seen advertised in one of sally mann 's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest , and i ca n't wait to partake of a first issue of 'aperture ' . feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed
1	i received my subscription in a timely manner and received backdated issues , also . i am very happy with the magazine
1	i like paula deen 's cooking , and find that i prefer to order my magazines through amazon because they send me an email update when my subscription is really about to expire , so i can choose to renew , instead of flooding me with 6 months ' worth of letters in the mail saying `` renew now '' or else , you 'll miss an issue . invariably , i never missed an issue , but i certainly overpaid too soon by sending in subscription cards and renewing too early when i may not have wanted to .
0	this publication has no business calling itself a `` magazine '' ; published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies , this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo . do n't waste your money
0	when i bought this magazine subscription i was under the impression that is for the cosmo that is sold/printed in spain . i was wrong . when my first issue arrived i see that it 's nothing more than the united states/english version translated into spanish . these 2 magazines are very different in content . while i 'll read this , i will not renew . just a `` heads up '' for anyone who wants to purchase this magazine
1	i unfortunately did n't renew my subscription to the week years ago due to constant travel and never being around to read it . i have missed it deeplyt in that time . having just gotten the first issue of my new subscription it lives up to all of my memories . a mixture of news items on all kinds of issues , from all sorts of publications and many points of view is refreshing and informative . i find out about important and interesting things about which most never hear . i can not say enough good things about the week
0	esquire is a subpar men 's magazine , in my opinon . more than half of the magazine is advertisements , and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking . if you like ads and cologne samples , pick it up . after all , it is pretty decently priced
1	if you live in the country and have a hobby-type farm , this magazine is bulging with valuable information . i was surprised to find no color pages at first , but the magazine is recycleable paper printed with soy ink ... very cool . out of all the country type magazines i 've read , this one is the best
1	i ordered a free trial of this mag a while back , before starting my own e-business recently . immediately i began a subscription . the reviews from pros on real businesses offer a lot of insight while the profiles give it a real world feel . i would recommend this to anyone even considering working in the high ranks of any business . keeps you informed and in touch .
1	outstanding comparitive review of new vehicles for 2006 . combined with consumers report evaluations , no reason to go into dealership with many questions . december 2005 issue a `` must have for serious lookers '' contemplating purchase
0	i 've been a people subscriber for 2 years now i quite agree with the majority of reviewers ... same celebrities , different week . if it is n't tomkat/kitten , it 's branjelina or benifer 2 . oh , and we can not forget `` mrs. oops , i did it again '' spears-federline . very little on real people/human interest stories anymore , very little ... as for the actual magazine , it seems i 've become , through no choice of my own , one of people 's quality control employees . after subscribing , i informed customer service of my allergy to their scented inserts . i was told a note would be made to my account and i would no longer receive inserts in my magazine . here is where my job of qc employee came in , with my having to remove these inserts several times the first year , then again the second year in which i made another call to customer service . they apologized . stated there was a note on my account regarding my request then they offered to extend my subscription for two more weeks . next problem and part of my `` new '' job requirements ... reassembling my magazine . i received at least 4 or 5 issues of people put together either backwards , upside down or with half of the magazine in the front the other half flipped over in back . in order to read and enjoy these issues , i had to remove the staples , try and rearrange the pages then line the pages up by the staple holes to reinsert the staples . again i called customer service to complain . again they apologized then offered to extend my subscription another 2 weeks . i 've since written to cancel my subscription . i 've not heard a word back from people inc. , regarding this . we 'll see how it turns out
1	business 2.0 is one of the few business magazines i read on a monthly basis , and just recently extended for another 2 years . one of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies - i do n't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest , most obviously successful companies . i want to know what the startups are doing , and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently . not everything is going to apply , but since your own business must constantly evolve , i like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses . why four stars ? to be honest , when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back , i feel the quality took a bit of a hit . i do n't care for the new design , though i 'm sure it saved a few dollars . and the number/quality of articles also slid a bit . but all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there , and by far the best in the `` new economy '' sector
0	i bought this magazine as reading material for my flight home from ruzyne airport in prague to nyc . this was the first time i ever purchased this magazine . terrible choice . first of all this magazine was not worth the $ 10+ usd i paid for it . it was way too large to do anything with on the airplane and the content was for the lack of a better word boring ! every other page was some chic ad . who buys this magazine ? well i will not be buying it again

0	i got a free one year sub . to another gaming mag . with purchase of a game at gamestop . after it ended , about 6 months later , i started receiving this magazine , and i thought it was the same one , some kind of mix-up . but i did n't get a magazine every month . it skipped a few . finally i went on their site to complain , and they promised to send extra issues to make up for it . i told them that there must have been a mixup ... then i cancelled my supposed `` subscription '' , only to receive an e-mail saying that now they would n't be sending me anything , even the extra issues promised . stay away from these people ! these people are extremely unprofessional . try playstation mag instead if you have a ps - i was just reccommended it
1	i have been subscribed to this mag since before ps2 came out , and it has always proved to offer reliable , well explained and accurate reviews , as well as early previews and interesting articles . not only is it good to read , but it comes with a demo disc , which is packed with demos , video previews , game files , and other helpful and interesting features . if you are trying to choose one mag to subscribe to , this is the one you want
0	i picked up an issue of this magazine last week because i wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine i have ever seen . the articles read like something from `` teen beat '' , yet it 's filled with adult material . there were about 10 articles on `` how to please your man '' and `` what guys like '' and even a `` sex workout '' . these articles did n't contain any `` real '' advice -- just unintelligent babble . for instance , did any of you know that guys do n't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i do n't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating , and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read . but if you 're still into taking quizzes and looking at `` half-naked hunks '' who have barely hit puberty , then this magazine is perfect . i would have given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it 's not an option
0	this is one of the worse magazines i have picked up in years . if you have `` money to burn '' traveling , then it might be for you . loaded with advertising and little 'true ' content
0	this magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements . advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying , but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous . these ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine ... it seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness , to the level of competition . a recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women . some of the women had body fat below 10 % - i 'm trying to get mine below 30 % . it 's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness and shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice . i can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese . i ca n't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch , eat 10 servings of protein a day , and pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed with this magazine..
0	new york magazine 's articles and advertisements are too risque , always pushing the envelope . thanks , but no thanks
0	i have only received the paper for 2 weeks . where is it ? why did it stop comin
0	i have n't received this product yet and i 'm pretty upset about it . i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer . i think i 'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer . where is the product i bought ? ? ?
1	i sew , and i love this magazine . till recently i had an annual subscription and i need to refresh my subscription again . here are some helpful tips on why you might like to subscribe even if you do n't sew , and how to do so if you are out of the states area . for canadians there is a burda magazine reseller , and it will cost about 10 $ canadian per issue . which is much less than a normal pattern now . so it saves you on patterns . burda has ways to subscribe for each country , just go to their website and click till you get the reseller for your own area . why burda is the best ! the fashions presented are 2 years ahead . i found that styles presented in burda were a year ahead of hitting the stores in retail , and 2 to 3 years ahead of the other major pattern companies , and about 1 year ahead of burda 's pattern envelopes sold in the fabric stores . even if all you do is look at upcoming styles and never sew a stitch you will find this magazine useful to keep ahead of trend curves . this is what the european ladies are wearing . all clothing is well put together , showing current trends ( future trends for north america ! ) in europe in shoes , purses , jewelry , colour choices and more . they use fashion forward textiles to make the garments and the photos are clear enough that you can get trim detail and figure out fabric from your local store . looking at their trends page in each issue will give you an idea where things are going in accessories as well as fashion . if you do sew , this magazine will keep you from wasting money on outdated paper patterns and keep you in the front end of fashion . after all if you go to the trouble of sewing , and fitting it 's nice if you can wear something for a few extra years and look up to date while doing so . each magazine comes with all the patterns in regular sizing to make all the clothing featured . look thru , see what you like and trace off your own pattern . a note about sizes -- burda fits much closer than normal pattern companies which makes for a much nicer fit , but you may find yourself needing to go up a size or two . measure carefully , and try cutting one size up till you get used to the fit . do n't cut into expensive fabric till you are used to how they fit . make a few cheaper garments first . the armholes and the crotch area fit differently than north american clothes . plus sizes are not in all the featured clothes , but have a separate plus size section in the magazine . really nice styling for plus sizes too . however be aware that above a size 20/22 in north american sizes , wo n't fit into these plus sizes . their idea of plus is 14-20/22 . they have a special plus size magazine as well as burda moden , which is all plus sizes , and it comes out twice a year . i found that to be a useful addition to my regular burda magazine and the clothing was never duplicated from one to the other . children 's and men 's outfits are featured in many but not all of the issues . here are a couple of helpful hints to dealing with tracing off the patterns in the centerfold . i used waxed paper in the usual kitchen type roll and traced with a sharpie marker pen . why wax paper ? it 's cheap , you can see thru it , and you can fuse it into bigger sheets as needed . fusing wax paper : take a warm iron , and press thru a paper towel so you do n't get wax paper on your iron . ( when you finish , run your iron over a clean terry facecloth to absorb any wax that seeped out ) . when fusing , hold till the wax paper clings and it will look a bit `` bubbly '' . edited to add : use a highlighter pen to mark the lines you are tracing off . it will help you `` see '' the correct pattern peice and the correct size in the spaghetti trail that is the master pattern in the centerfold . tracing : burda patterns do n't come with a seam allowance so i added that after tracing my patterns . using a sharpie and a straight edge for long runs i traced off my desired size in the patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over the newsprint center . about all those lines . here is where my wax paper tip comes in handy . i 've tried tracing paper , even interfacing but the multiple lines on a burda magazine pattern are too much for those usual tracing papers or interfacing . you will need something much more see thru . wax paper ! cheap , almost transparent , sturdy and wo n't bleed sharpie marker ink . burda does n't print one sided pattern masters so you have to trace . you ca n't just sacrifice the rest of the patterns to cut yourself one only since the other peices will likely be printed on the back . remember to add your seam allowance once i cut out my pattern ( and write all the notes about what size , layout , darts etc on the pattern ) i put my pattern pieces in a manila envelope . pattern envelopes for home made patterns work best with some labelling . i put the magazine ( june 05 ) and the page # ( 34 ) and the model i 'm copying along with the size , the yardage i require and any sewing notions or extras ( zippers , interfacing , 17 buttons , yada yada ) maybe due to being a bit obsessive about such things i sketch a line drawing on the envelope with a note saying , skirt , pants , jacket or whatever the garment is . my drawing is n't perfect but i try to include a front and back view with major seams and darts drawn in . it 's useful . i keep them in a normal household file folder , since the manila envelopes fit perfectly . file under jacket , dress , skirt etc . or by year . there , i hope that helps . this is well worth getting even if you never sew a single stitch from the magazine .
1	so often when looking through magazines i have n't found quite what i was looking for in the christian literature . i like the approach christianity today takes . it has articles that are broad , and not focused on a specific demonination . i believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it . i do like the variety of articles , and coverage of current events . i would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of christianity in the modern world
0	i have never gotten this product so it 's hard to know how to rate it . wish amazon would send me things in a timely manner
0	i have been a subscriber to cgw for almost 10 years . sadly , i have to end the subscription now . it was a very good magazine ; but no more . one reason is that more than half of the magazine are now ads . the second reason is that the size of the magazine is getting smaller and smaller with the layout that is getting very hard to read . and the reviews are bad . the reviews do n't have a professional kind of feel anymore . i ca n't totally blame the magazine . a big part is due to the gaming industry . there is no good game anymore . they are all fps and mmorpg . just how many time you can review the same type of games ? one positive thing about cgw is that it now comes with a dvd full of demo . i think the dvd alone is worth the subscription . but for me , it is done
1	about two years ago , i became a subscriber to shape , mainly because i had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine . i had always liked browsing through issues of shape in the supermarket , and i thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i have enjoyed shape and found it to be useful , but there definitely are some negatives , and the magazine might not be for everyone . but first the good . like many others have mentioned , what i most enjoy about shape is their real-life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women , some of whom actually needed to *gain* weight in order to be healthy . i also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year-long weight loss journey . many of their other regular features are also excellent , particularly the body part-focused strength exercises and other how-to exercise guides . and i especially like that shape uses `` reader models '' with so many of their articles -- real life women of various ages ( although admittedly , mostly in the 25-35 range ) with normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises , and the recipes are often quite good as well . the main negative has already been brought up by many others here : the use of too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand that to sell magazines , the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness , but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now and then ! as i said above , the reader models are great ; the women are usually quite fit , but they have muscles and curves too , which is wonderful to see . shape may be trying to make some improvements in this area , as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise ( such as denise richards ) , but they still have a long way to go . and while they 're at it , i hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they can still show off their model 's physique and showcase cute fitness wear at the same time . similarly , i would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end *unless* they start focusing it on exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you are overweight and/or new to exercising , you may find the magazine discouraging , but if you can get past some of the negatives , it can also be inspiring . i think it 's up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts ; for me , it is helpful , but this definitely might not be the case with everyone
0	ct is quick to call the collection agency . they require written `` opt-out '' notification from the subscriber that the subscription is to be terminated . beware , these guys are a credit risk . too much trouble for what is otherwise a good magazine
0	the national enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency . to now attack a sweet , wonderful , charitable guy like clay aiken is very very sad . to go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing , but to go after a quiet humble guy like clay is another . and now what ? is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage . their story is ludicrous and they owe clay , his family , and all of his fans a big apology . i will not buy this filthy rag or any american media products ever again
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine , but no longer . ofcourse , there are too many adds ( but then , that 's what pays for the mag ) . i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles ( the hard hitting type ) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical . i buy elle for `` the fashion/beauty advice '' not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda . for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal , atlantic monthly , and watch fox news .
1	i had subscribed to science news for many years and somehow let it expire when i moved . i missed it greatly and was so glad to start receiving it again . it seems to be the best way to stay current on many fields of science
1	what kind of magazine can you get for that age in between ? to old for the `` highlights '' or other kids mags and still to young ( girls anyway ) for seventeen , teen people or young miss ... ranger rick ! ! my daughter is 10 and just loves ranger rick . she has a great love of nature and wildlife and this just fuels her curiosity . filled with outstanding pictures , fun facts and great information , she enjoys it all ! highly recommend for a gift when your not sure what to get
0	i 've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and i 've loved getting this , but it has undergone changes recently and not for the better . specifically , i hate what they 've done to the graphical design inside . whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about , now they 've adopted a uniform style where nearly everything looks the same . it looked better before . the writing is n't as witty or sharp ( have longtime staff departed ? ) , and there are `` filler '' pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply do n't work . the strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics , especially the movie and dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i 'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos i do n't let my mailbox fill with crap like this
0	this magazine tries hard , but its quality is perhaps the lowest in the woodworking magazine field . photos not lighted well , illustrations lacking in detail , and lots of rambling text pretty much sums it up . the annual tool issue is a wasted issue imho
1	i got a free subscription to this newspaper and i am thoroughly enjoying it . the olympics coverage was wonderful along with the color pics . i like their editorial pages too and my favorite part is the life section . i love the color pics and the celebrity news and the reality tv news synopsis . i used to only read this paper when travelling or on vacation . now i am reading it daily and they may have a subscriber for life
0	i ordered star magazine in late december 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords . she stopped receiving it in june , well before her 12 month subscription expired .
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! this is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries ! the magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones . a wonderful magazine
1	i 've had previous subscriptions to this magazine and i have to say that its most entertaining in many respects . the fiction keeps you reading , guy 's first times are always interesting , the interviews are informative ... oh , and then there 's the hot guys ( all perfectly legal ) showing all their worth . a great mag for anyone that can appreciate the beauty that is the young man
1	great magazine , i use this magazine and go to http : //www.buyacarforum.com to learn everything about cars and to buy a new car , try it out , its great
0	this used to be my favorite magazine , but now it 's just ad after ad after ad . i go outside to get away from it all , and i like to read about climbing , biking , hiking , etc. , when i have to be inside . all the ads drain the joy from me .
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market . very realistic with budgets too . it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable ( on any budget ) . i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful
0	the pantings are nice and colorful and mostly in oil but not enough technique shown to really be of help
0	amazon sells a one year subscription for $ 14 which includes a $ 5 amazon certificate that you get later . in the actual magazine , the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $ 10.00 so use the card , save some money and also dont have to wait for your $ 5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $ 5 certificate on .
1	this magazine is devoted to american inventions and technology that have affected our lives . in essence , this magazine is a historical magazine about american technology . within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention . the articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology . typically , each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society . the scope of the magazine is broad . there have been articles on the trans-canada highway . another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines . in yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines . the contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned , an interesting piece of trivia of which i was previously unaware . the scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences . biology and the development of medical technology are also covered . while the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand , some of the biology related articles challenge my attention . this magazine is an excellent source of technological history . however , while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology , this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field . as an example , i had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works . therefore , while i highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology , realize that for some readers , for example elementary school students , this magazine could present a reading challenge . most articles also provide pictures or other artwork . frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history . the quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved , but in many cases they are the only pictures available . this magazine frequently mentions the inventor 's hall of fame in akron , ohio , which is sponsored by the united states patent trademark office . a number of articles have covered inductees to the inventor 's hall of fame , showing that while the articles are historical in nature , they are also currently relevant . there are a large number of magazines that are either about technology , or have had articles about technology . there are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology . sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention . however , the `` american heritage of invention technology '' is the only magazine of which i am aware the covers the history of invention and technology . while the focus of the articles is american technology , it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of american technology . i consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology , and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines .
1	i started a subscription for my granddaughter , now four , a couple years ago . she loves animals , and loves your big backyard . goes through it from cover to cover . i 'd highly recommend it .
1	the economist has to be the best weekly magazine for current events . whether you are conservative or liberal you will appreciate the well thought out and reasoned essays that this magazine has to offer . i do n't think this will end up swaying people 's political opinions too much but it will at least provide an informed opinion . americans know too little about the world around them and this is the perfect tool for fixing that . there are arguments that this magazine swings on both sides of the political fence depending on your views . i have my opinions on this but still love it . the articles i disagree with force me to think and hone my own debates . to compare this magazine with newsweek or time is like comparing a precision automobile with one of those 25 cent rides kids enjoy . sure they make the motions of a car , and look like a car but in the end they do n't go anywhere and you wasted your money with nothing to show for it . this magazine does more with its short essays than newsweek could ever do with its six-page layouts . too bad there is n't a `` teen '' version of this magazine . that would do a lot to rectify america 's education problems . i find the argument that some people cite that this magazine has a severe pro-laissez faire bias is ridiculous at best . it is like criticizing auto magazines for having a combustion engine bias . this is a magazine of economics . since laissez faire economics is the basis for just about every single economy in the world , they concentrate on it . sorry but marxist and keynesian economic models did n't pan out . maybe if feudilism mounts a come back they might change their focus , until then we are stuck with reality .

1	as a white middle-aged male , i always get strange looks from the counter girl when i buy my issue of black men . i do n't know why though , where else can i do my research ? every white man 's dream is a six-foot , big bootied , large breasted , black woman with straight silky hair . it is my dream to marry one . so when i 'm cruising the turfs in my pimped out ride , or hip-hoppin ' at the club , i got ta have the knowledge i need to hang with whatever ebony queen i have the priviledge of bumping into . you ca n't fake your front . it 's a lot more than just bling , 40 's , and expensive hubcaps . a hard core wigga 's got to be down with the scene . latest trends like music , fashion , and political viewpoints are all covered extensively and it makes it so much easier for me . could you imaging me walking into tobie 's lounge with a jogging suit listening to vanilla ice ? no , i got to fill my dome with the cutting edge jive needed to be a true playa . watch out you african princesses . white dudes want you and we read this mag to better our chances . we may not wear raiders caps with the tags still on them , but we are listening to 50 cent . once you go white , you 'll be feeling alright . peace

1	i love glamour ! this has to be my favorite magazine of all times ! granted the ads drive me nuts but i love the do and don'ts and all the clothes . i am a shopping mogul ! this magazine is great for showing new trends and i love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way . i also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that i am interested in . i read glamour almost from cover to back ! i rarely skip articles ! if you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you ! **i have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine , but it is not terrible . *
1	i also have only read one volume , but the ideas therein are so societally under-represented . the articles are controversial , sometimes satirical , and very educational . orion is a welcome addition to any deep-thinker 's coffee table
1	lieven 's article , `` in the mirror of europe : the perils of american nationalism '' ; is succinct , cogent , and in my opinion frighteningly accurate . my experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance , whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11 , war on terrorism and god , which the majority of my students now accept as truth . i have one suggestion , i think mr. lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power . i feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch , much of the leadership of coporate america , an increasing number of jewish and christian denominations , much of the media-particularly am talk radio , higher education , the military , and with another four years of the current administration , federal courts at all levels . i will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups . i think the article was well-written and important , my congratulations to the author
0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided , why not ? ? its been a year and , although the previews of each week 's prime-time programs are fun ( 2 pages worth ) i was very dissapointed . the articles are empty , boring and some downright retarded ; rehashing show 's dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around . i realize this is an entertainment magazine , but still , the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide - much more interestin
1	based on negative reviews , either i 've been knitting too long to still have good sense , or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine . it is my favorite , and i do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters . i found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues ( a reviewer did n't find any in a couple years of issues ) . re zimmerman-type designs , you can make any sweater in one or two pieces , change gauge , needle sizes , yarns , etc . search websites to give you the basics for free . after 2 years of crochet , i learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles , found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain , fancy , aran , jacquard , sideways or you-name-it . i like knit 'n style . thanks for reading this
0	i started reciving vibe magazine in the mail announced and unexpected . this would n't be the first time this happened , turns out my grandmother bought me people magazine as a gift and the copies were sent to my house . i figured that somebody had got me this magazine as a gift . next thing i know a charge for the magazine appears on my bank statement . i called vibe immediately and asked them what had happened . they told me that there was nothing they could do and that their company did n't directly deal with the payment issues and subscription services . they gave me a toll free number that i was too call from an outside company that handled the payments . when i called this company , it was completely automated service , could not speak with an actual person regardless of what extension i used . i eventually had to go down to my bank and find out what i could do . turns out vibe had illegally gained my bank account number and had been charging me for months , but i had only just recently started to recieve the magazine . i had to close down my checking account and open up a new one , which resulted in me being charged by my gym and other other companies that had access to my account in order to subtract monthly bills . it was as if i had written them a bad check , something that i had never done in my life and now greatly questioned my credibility . please do not support these people , they are theives and on top of that the magazine is terrible and uncredible . i seriously hope that my review will help deter any and all people from subscribing to this magazine
0	the legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when `` the gramophone '' was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music . whether or not that legend is true ( i 'm too young to know ) , gramophone 's time has definitely passed . today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet , from newsgroups to websites . some of it is less well-informed than gramophone 's criticism , but some of it is more well-informed . what is undeniable is that , for the price of a few mouse-clicks , it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the internet than gramophone ( with its british-based critics ) can offer . what is more , gramophone is tied to a business-model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete . historically , the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so-called `` major '' companies such as emi , deutsche grammophon and cbs ( later sony ) . these `` majors '' would buy lavish advertising spreads in gramophone and so finance the magazine . in return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors ' new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors . today the situation is different . the most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a mp3 on an obscure russian website than on a new cd from sony . small companies , dedicated solely to classical music recordings , produce great results on shoestring budgets while the `` major '' corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems for gramophone 's business model . the new players in the classical music industry do n't have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . with gramophone 's implicit bargain : `` advertise with us or we wo n't review your recordings '' , the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant . if you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical , i recommend `` international record review '' or `` fanfare '' . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most of all , i suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet
1	i bought this for my dad for christmas this year and he loves the idea . yes , it is taking a while for the first subscription to arrive , but they warned me it would be 6-8 weeks . with the money savings , i did n't mind waiting a bit for the first issue . they even mailed me a little gift certificate notification card to send to my dad
0	laptop magazine focuses on laptops , pdas , and wireless computing . laptop magazine seems like it 's trying to be both technical and exciting ; however it lacks the objectivity of pc magazine and the deep enthusiasm of wired . thus , it reads like a series of infomercials where each `` article '' paints a rose-colored view of each technology and the vendors products followed by paid ads of the same vendors portrayed so happily in the text . their conclusions all seem predetermined : new technology is better
1	my retirement plan sends me a magazine , which is so boring that i do n't even bother to open it anymore ; kiplinger 's is n't at all like that . the best part of kiplinger 's is that it describes how real people with average salaries , kids , and debts can invest for the future . there are also some great articles for parents about how to teach their kids to manage their money . everything seems practical , but i 've yet to try any of it . the magazine is broken into four sections : `ahead ' short articles about finance news and current event , `investing ' about investing mostly stocks , `your money ' about ways to invest your money though not as technical as the investing section and more diverse , and `spending ' which is basically general interest about new fun technologies and other ways to spend all the money saved or made through investing

0	i subscribed to food wine for a while and was continuously disappointed . the articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been . i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff . the magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad . this magazine ca n't hold a candle to bon appetit or gourmet
0	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70 % or more . plus , articles ( less than 15 articles in every issue ) in the magazines are not very useful . i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers . now i realize i made a mistake .
1	i absolutely love this magazine . it not only has tons of helfpul fitness tips , but it does not require you be a size 2 . the self fitness challenge is my favorite part of the year .
1	elle decor ( us ) magazine is the best of them all - by a long shot . i subscribe to , and buy off the shelf , about 10-15 different decor magazines a month from around the world . elle decor is the best . it dos n't matter what style you like , this magazine covers it , with great style and always with integrity . the editor in cheif , margaret russel deserves a medal
1	few magazines can match the new yorker 's high caliber of journalism , fiction , reviews , and of course , cartoons ; all written by some of the best writers in the land . it makes mainstream magazines like time and us news look like high school newspapers . but , one word of caution : if you 're the type of person that whines `` liberal bias '' at anything that you slightly disagree with , then this is not the magazine for you .
1	this is the ultimate magazine for mystery readers and mystery writers . from front cover to back , it 's full of the information you need to know about new books , favorite authors , and what 's going on in the mystery business
1	every month this magazine presents very interesting articles that expand your knowledge around science
0	i ca n't imagine how many hours of my life i wasted worrying about ego-trippin ' jocks . although , i understand how i got hooked on this bad habit . the rich folk who own our media do a great job of marketing this endless diversion to the masses . so , instead of worrying about economic justice , environmental destruction , the well-being of children and so forth ; the passion of a large segment of the general public is frittered away on watching one city 's gladiators combat another city 's gladiators . on top of that , with the us vs. them pattern of thinking that is encouraged , the anthem singing , and so many pro sports figures involved with right-wing politics ( bernie kosar , john elway , steve largent ) , i 've come to realize how poltically-charged this so called `` escape '' actually is . on top of that , i just got sick of all these sports announcers barking about this or that , wagging their finger in my face . the ads in sports illustrated are also a bunch of macho [ ... ] . by the way , before he was killed by `` friendly fire , '' pat tillman was reading noam chomsky and howard zinn books . in fact , he had arranged to have a meeting with chomsky after he returned from our war of terror . too bad he was n't able to pursue that path . my interest in sports is now limited to badminton in my backyard , and books like `` what 's my name fool ? '' which is about how sports figures sometimes remember issues like peace and justice
1	this is one of my favorite magazines , and the only magazine subscription i 've ever given as a gift . my list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate . i 've gifted the floss to my 73-year-old retired grandma , my 23-year-old writer sister , my 40-year-old trivia buff co-worker , and my 15-year-old high school sophomore cousin . you might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my christmas list , and you 're probably right . but there 's something in mental floss for everybody . i pick up a half-dozen conversational nuggets each month . i probably subscribe to 10 mags , and i 'd say this is the one i actually read every month . great stuff . my highest recommendation .
0	i was gon na make a point , but fabz made it for me i was gon na say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles and yayo 's hit singles werent really hits his songs were on the radio tv for probably about a month or two if thats what you call a hit then you crazy the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 songs on the cd a couple of good songs dont make it good cd you want to see what other people think of the yayo album read the reviews for it and jeezy please he always been garbag
0	i used to love outburn magazine . i first discovered it when i came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain . the first thing i saw on the cover was vnv nation . i bought that issue and soon after that i ordered a subscription . what i loved about outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that are n't covered in the mainstream music magazines , namely those in the goth , ebm , synthpop , and industrial scene . unfortunately within the next year and a half , the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands , two genres i do n't give a rat 's behind about . i do n't know wtf happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music i would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to . just like alternative press , outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends
1	woman 's day has the feel of a community with its intensely personal warmth . from parenting advice , health , cooking , crafts and homemaking and more , it bonds its target audience together whether you 're a single mom , happily married , or even single . i enjoyed this magazine as a teen with my mom and love it even more as an adult . highly recommend
0	i have yet to see a pw review of anything that was not vetted by the pc police , not to mention utterly stupid . when they want to pan a book , they apparently have a list of criticisms they pick from at random , such as `` non sequitur '' or `` murky argument '' or `` reductionist '' . they pick them by throwing darts at the list and writing down whatever phrases the darts hit , in ways that prove that they do n't actually have any understanding of what the terms mean . it 's especially annoying because even when it 's a book i like , i can easily see criticisms that someone with a different worldview could make that would be valid , but they do n't make them ; that would require work . the reviews are so shoddy and wildly inaccurate that i thought about asking amazon.com to stop using them for the product info pages , but then it occurred to me that any book pw pans is guaranteed to be good , so they are useful in a backwards way . anytime pw praises a book , i do n't bother with it , but if they attack it , i know it 's going to be great
0	self what ? the entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page . their product placements went from `` convenient and subtle '' to obviously pandering to their revenue sources . plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain could n't relate . i once enjoyed self and their monthly self-help plans . their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing
0	i made the mistake of subscribing to make , based on the hype . it turns out to be long and tedious , with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use . successive issues have gone down hill , and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people 's garage workshops . maybe you 'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk , but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe . it 's not obviously wonderful
1	filter and under the radar are the only music magazines i come near . i hear mojo is just as informative , renovative , and enjoyable , but i 'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres i ... do n't care much about . fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling `` indie '' /alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/ ! ! ! ! , take a gander at this . and the covers are slick and durable . they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table .
0	i admit , they have some good recipes , but most of them are not simple and very time-consuming . there is always a million ingredients in each little recipe . if you are a stay-at-home housewife and absolutely love to cook , buy this , but if you are just normal , you wo n't find many recipes in here for you . i suggest you consider 'cuisine at home ' before you buy this one
1	i used to love this magazine . it still has some excellent articles , but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things i have no interest in ( resort hotels , spas , expensive travel agents ) . however , on the flip side , it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which i appreciate . i checked out nat geographic traveller hoping it would be like the cn traveller of old , but although it has nicer photography ( with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots ) , it seemed much more mainstream - like i had already done many of the `` dream trips '' befor i hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower . i like geo , but i struggle through the french and it 's a lot more expensive
0	for some strange reason , i began receiving this magazine in the mail . never ordered . never paid for . my conclusion based on reading the last three issues : you 're kidding me . how can time inc. still publish this rag ? what 's the point
1	i first ordered this magazine as a christmas gift in 2005 for a friend . she loves it , and i 'll definitely renew it for her when the time comes . this christmas ( 2006 ) i just bought another subscription to this magazine for relatives who are very familar with france and enjoy its language and culture . i 'm sure they 'll be pleased
0	i subscribed to bhg from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year . the articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine , with its overwhelming amount of advertising , takes away from any good points . i 've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads . it 's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts . i rarely find anything i 'd want to save . overall a disappointment
1	dirt rag is the real mountain biking magazine . it 's not as flashy as the others , but for me , mountain biking is not about flash . it 's not all about racing and corporations . it 's about people and riding . and so is dirt rag
1	`` creativity is like life insurance . if you are creative , you are never afraid , because you can design yourself out of any situation . '' ~li edelkoort if you are interested in items like the nissan actic concept car ( that has a matching trailer ) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom , kitchen or garden , this magazine delivers . dwell has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef . for example , the april/may 2004 issue had articles on : home cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home . cutting it up - a downtown los angeles loft gets a makeover . stainless chef - designer john picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub . victorian revival - a san franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations . trend diva - jane szita talks about nesting and nihilism . other interesting articles include information on houses that become art , short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space . i was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or cd changers which are most modern . well , until i can afford a 9,500 buck oven , i 'll keep reading and dreaming . the library in the april/may issue is to die for ! big windows and shelves galore . dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did ! even some of the text is in color . the marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design , house or otherwise . the sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources . ~the rebecca review
0	cooking pleasures magazine is the magazine produced by the cooking club of america . i very happily joined cooking club of america , and began receiving this magazine quite a while ago . the club offers so much to its subscribers , but as time wore on , i could see that the marketing department was a tad too aggressive for my taste . the cooking club of america offers their potential members numerous items to entice them to join . members can take part in member-only contests where kitchen products and gift baskets are some of the prizes . they can be sent food items or kitchen products to review . they can also receive a cheese grater for joining ! there are some nice photographs in this publication . the recipes are not complicated either , although they do require some unusual ingredients and some that are very expensive that many people would find hard to locate . i , personally , had to forego some recipes , and others ; i had to order a couple of ingredients online , because of the reasons given . the cheese grater sent to you is a nice idea , but being it is a rotary grater , you have to squeeze very hard to get the cheese to grate . also , the grater is made of plastic and eventually snaps in half after using it only a handful of times . the club also offers you a culinary resource directory . the information contained in this directory is not difficult to find in a basic internet search . you can also receive standard sized blank recipe cards . unfortunately , due to the size of recipe cards , i do not believe anyone can even write the ingredients onto them without running out of space . also , part of the member benefits is to sample products for review . potential members can see photographs of blenders , ice cream makers and much more . while a member there for three years , i did have the opportunity to review quick rise yeast and a chipotle spice . both were nice products . they were not the glamorous photos of kitchen appliances , but it was something ! currently , they are offering a visa credit card with their logo . with this card , not only can you use the card like any other credit card , but also you can receive club discounts . if this is something that appeals to you , see the club for details . approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription , they start mailing you about how you should renew your membership for the following year now , so that you can help them keep club costs down . after just paying for the current year , i was not interested in paying for another year already . an idea may be to not contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions . that may save the club some money . i have caller id , and i utilize it all the time , screening my calls to specifically avoid telemarketing calls . imagine my surprise when i pick up a call and it was a representative for cooking club of america . i was , actually , pleasantly surprised , thinking i was about to embark on another benefit of being a member . i was most disappointed to hear the mono-toned voice on the other end of the line , reading the script , suggesting i become a lifetime member now . when i tell them i am not interested , they have a `` new '' deal for me . when i still tell them i am not interested , they have yet another deal . the calls continued after this conversation for another couple of months . at this point , my subscription has expired . i was relieved as the telemarketing phone call really turned me off . you should have been there to see me receive my credit card statement . cooking club of america automatically charged my credit card with my next subscription without my permission . it was three months after my original subscription expired ! as you can imagine , this was extremely upsetting . upon doing my research for this article , i have come to find that others have had similar experiences with this magazine . it 's a shame too , as this magazine has plenty of potential . unfortunately , their marketing department could utilize different tactics in maintaining their current membership . despite this magazine being very affordable , i recommend that you save your money on this one and try fine cooking , cuisine at home or cook 's illustrated . not only do these magazines provide better recipes , more professional tips , they also do not call you daily to get your money
1	you can buy a subscription to the bimonthly `` audubon '' magazine , but the best way to get it is as a benefit derived from joining the national audubon society ( currently $ 35/year ) . conservation is a central theme of this magazine , but it also has lots of gorgeous photographs of sandhill cranes , snowflakes , caribou , and everything else that you might expect from a nature magazine , although the articles tend toward pessimism ( 'grim realism ' some might say . ) there are also lots and lots of ads for people who would like to go eco-touring or birding in exotic locales . i learned to my dismay that i 'm not even classified as a birder because i 've never traveled somewhere to see a particular bird . i 'm just a humble birdwatcher who tries to identify the avian species that show up at our feeders ( everything from wild turkeys to ruby-throated humming birds . ) on the pessimistic side , the march-april 2005 issue of `` audubon '' has warnings about global warming ( which might affect the fertility of leopard geckos ) , easter ducklings that parents buy for their children , then drop off in the local pond when they get too big ( most breeds of domestic ducks and geese ca n't fly . basically the unwanted ducks sit in the pond and starve ) , the over-harvesting of dead wood in european forests ( bechstein 's bat nests in dead wood ) , and the american eel , which has to run the gauntlet of `` bait hunters , turbines , and spillways ... in a constant battle to hold its own . '' there are some bright spots , too : the red-tailed hawk known as 'pale male ' is holding its own in new york city , along with its mate , lola . 'freecycling ' on the internet has `` inspired more than half a million people to keep their junk out of landfills '' -- i thought this was going to be an article about e-bay , but 'freecycling ' is something different . it 's more of an 'adoption agency ' than an auction site . if you 're interested in 'freecycling ' your extra firewood or an outdated computer , check out the website at freecycling.org . anyone who is interested in birding , or the state of the world 's ecology would do well to join the national audubon society . your membership fee will help in the fight to protect endangered environments and species , and you 'll get this interesting magazine as a side benefit .
0	i ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it .
1	if you love fashion , you need to get vogue . vogue will familiarize you with designers , classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into . however , most of what is in vogue is way out of the average person 's reach . i , for one , could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of vogue . however , for whatever reason , the vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a very low price ( usually $ 12 for 12 issues ) . now that i can afford . it is an unbeatable deal . will you glean anything from it ? yes . you will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best . is it practical ? not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price .
1	intermezzo is , without question , my very favorite magazine . i think it 's the best magazine on the market ; most beautiful , most interesting , and has the best recipes . have already made several recipes from the new issue and they are phenomenal , and pretty simple too . particularly loved the pear nectar punch which i served at my christmas party , as well as the saffron chicken which i have already made 3 times . i used to alternate subscribing to bon appetit and gourmet but have let those lapse . have given it as a gift to several friends who love it as well . any time i have had a change of address or customer service question , i have been pleased and astonished with the personal and prompt attention of the staff , even once the publisher heself . i think intermezzo is a small company putting out a world class publication . i do wish it came out more often though as i would love to see more of it .
0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count , and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits , measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues . and yet our patronage here is very conservative . perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all , or maybe , as a couple of reviewers suggested , with bill clinton out of office , it no longer has the same appeal . you can change my rating to five stars if you like , for the sake of ideology , but you still wo n't read the thing . just like i do n't read the nation anymore
1	`` discipleship journal '' does what many other christian magazines do not do . it provides instruction , and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ-focused faith . while others may talk about christianity , dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture . this is n't an evangelistic magazine , like `` decision , '' or an encouraging magazine , per se , like `` moody . '' it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god 's word says . it is not for the passive pew sitter . this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays . there is nothing watered-down here . it is published by navpress , who , like their counterparts , the college ministry navigators , know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian . whether it is a discussion about satan 's favorite lies , how to study a particular book of the bible , or an explanation of what prayer is an is not , dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our lord and his ways . this is a great tool for two or three people to use together . even a small group ... to go through the articles , week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life . i 've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week 's class . i fully recommend `` discipleship journal . '' expect your faith to grow . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
1	i enjoyed this magazine as a kid , but then , i also loved electric company . looking at both now , they seem dated and tedious , but perhaps our children need something that moves at a slower pace than everything seems to do now . neither of my children ( 5 7 ) enjoyed highlights at first , but after getting a subscription from their grandmother , they have discovered the joy of curling up in a quiet corner and figuring out the puzzles and stories for themselves . it 's a magazine with a style and format that encourages reflection and absorption , rather than a voracious grab and go version of reading , that i believe will give a child a better foundation . `` to read without reflection is like eating without digesting '' edmund burk
0	i ordered the journal about a year ago and received 2 issues , and never received another issue . i contacted customer service about the problem , used the problem report forms ( or whatever it 's called ) and never heard from them again . i get this email today telling me to renew my subscription ... ( after i had almost forgotten about the whole incident ) what nerve ! ! ! i remember when i bought this a year ago , another person had written a review warning people that she had not received her subscription . back then i just thought this would never happen to me.. ( the same thing happened with vogue magazine ) boy was i wrong . the 2 issues that i did receive were pretty good though . i buy tons of stuff from amazon but i would highly recommend getting this from another vendor or ebay ( they 're usally cheaper too )
1	mr. hayek apparently despises free thought . furthermore , his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear ; discounting his opinion is appropriate . i 'm guessing he is a republicrat and finds the socialist ideas found in the corrupt two party system satisfying . funny considering his namesake , frederich hayek , is one of the greatest libertarian thinkers of all time and one of my personal heros . but , i digress : reason magazine has been in my mailbox every month for well over 20 years and i would buy a lifetime subscription if i could . not every issue is a five star issue , but on the whole reason is the most interesting periodical on the market . that said , reason has dropped a notch in quality ever since the brilliant virginia postrel left the editor 's post several years ago . she is a true intellectual and kept reason at a consistently high level . i still love to read my issue every month and while i do n't always agree with the positions i am always stimulated
0	i have been a subscriber for 15 years and still enjoy the magazine . no , its not the best magazine for music , but it is one of the best for for general pop culture news and i still occassionally find new artists because of the magazine , though i tend to find more new movies now . however , if you ever have a problem with customer service , forget it . i never got my copy of the 1,000 issue , and when i asked for a replacement , i was told they were out of that issue , but would extend my subscription by one issue . i pointed out that it was a double issue and that they are still selling back issues on their web site for $ 20 . if they do n't resolve it quick , i might just cancel my subscription , i 'm so disgusted .
1	with its weekly distribution , there is almost too much information . articles are balanced and cover a wide range of topics . quickly responds with articles about new concepts and ideas
0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine . but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands ( with a big , heavy thud ) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing . it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders , self-regarding movie celebs , and those people who 'd like to be part of that world . even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject , the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent . it 'd be more accurate simply to cut `` fair '' out of the title
1	here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like `` wallpaper '' an expensive , hit-or-miss read . what i like most about `` dwell '' is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time . even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine , so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial . there is a very useful `` marketplace '' section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art , furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented . i have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place . this magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller , but i like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well . individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes , thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference . the photography is superb . if you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers , this is a great , reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design . highly recommended
1	i 'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name . however , i love all the other features in the magazine ! it is cooking light , but there is so much more - always an article on a travel destination , an article on beauty , and an article on a sport , as well as other constants . the theme of the magazine is total healthy living , incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food , though i do think that it is mostly a food magazine . i gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good , some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive .
1	playboy still has it ; it 's not just a magazine for men any more . this magazine has it all , articles , jokes , stories , and of course gorgeous woman ! unlike most adult magazines this one has class ; it does n't show extreme acts nor excessive nudity . it does what it needs to with as little as possible . you get mostly articles , and interviews with few images but the images you do get are great . this is one magazine you do n't have to hide from your significant other , unless of course they are the jealous type . why ? because woman seem to enjoy it just as much as men . hell the woman in it are gorgeous and very sexy but they are n't shown in a un-classy manner , they are shown as woman should be shown ; goddesses . i believe if you do n't have a subscription to this you should get one , and if you have a girlfriend let her read it too . it is n't just about sexy woman , its about the world and life itself . it depicts what we as americans love , freedom . of course naked ladies do n't hurt . -da
1	i purchased national geographic kids , your big bad yard , animal baby and ranger rick for a family of four children . they fight over each issue and now want renewals . how much better is this than a $ 20 toy for them , their parents and me ? how does it feel to have a child remind me in july that he loves his christmas gift ? immeasurable . there is no down side
1	wonderful cycling magazine for everyday riders . the content is very well rounded covering racing , touring , commuting , recreational cycling , and mountain biking . this magazine does n't just focus on how to make you faster or how to get you to buy the newest/greatest/lightest $ 8000 carbon bike . most of the equipment the magazine tests is geared for regular folks who can afford reasonable prices . the only problem i have is the price in the u.s
1	some articles are out dated.. why iraq appears in every issue ... so borin
1	where else can you get a magazine that talks about whatever it wants ? from the perspectives of guys obsessed with computers , technology , and electronics , you get to find out news on just about anything remotely relating to these topics . political , scientific , hollywood , businesses , technology , i love it . i get to read about topics that are covered in mainstream news sources , and on the next page , what 's new with japanese schoolgirls . i get such a kick out of it . i also love the pseudo-geek talk that they caricature . it 's kind of stupid that reviews are all `` wired '' or `` tired '' but in a funny stupid way . and buried in the enjoyable trash of this magazine are of course , all the many articles about new electronics that i love to keep up with . like popular science , only not lame . well , i do like popsci , so i should n't make fun of them .
1	after reading a few of the other reviews , i am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things . this is a conservative magazine ! ! liberals , open at your own risk ! you just might encounter a differing view point than you own ! goodness . the articles are informative , indepth , humorous , and thoughtful . it 's a good read .
1	under the radar and filter are the only music magazines i come near . i hear mojo is just as informative , renovative , and enjoyable , but i 'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres i ... do n't care much about . fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling `` indie '' /alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/ ! ! ! ! , take a gander at this . and the covers are slick and durable . they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table
0	for some strange reason , i began receiving this magazine in the mail . never ordered . never paid for . my conclusion based on reading the last three issues : you 're kidding me . how can time inc. still publish this rag ? what 's the point
0	if you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what 's really going on in the world , read this magazine . national review is for people who sympathize with christian jihadists and white supremacists . would n't want to be in that camp if i were you . read time , mother jones , the nation , or the american prospect instead .
1	i have been subscribing to alfred hitchcock 's mystery magazine for many years . i find it an excellent periodical . the genres range from humor , cosies , hard-boiled detectives , to locked room puzzles , with an added dessert of a `` mystery classic '' at the end of every issue , some dating from the 19th century . i especially enjoy the absence of gore . the stories are just the right length to satisfy your `` mystery craving '' before bedtime . another kudo : the ahmm is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors
0	i started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81 . it was excellent ! ! it had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to `` preventing '' ailments/conditions . now it 's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters ! wow ... what a change now . i 'm not interested in `` paying '' to read ads . i 'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources . besides , i got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while i rode the stationery bike ! what a waste of trees . :
1	this was a very good price for a very good magazine . i saved $ 3 - $ 5 over the normal subscription rate
0	the magazine has a broad range of patterns . out of 1 year there are about 10 things i want to make . or i should say i wanted to make- until i started on the first one . they have a high percentage of errors in the patterns . one issue had 13 out of 30 that had corrections . the worst part is , they do n't seem to post corrections until a reader has tried to knit the item and told them what was wrong . which means that unless you want to do a lot of counting , calculating , ripping and reknitting , you have to wait until an issue has been out for 6 months and other readers have found the errors . i 'm working on a cardigan that i plan to give to someone for christmas , and have found 2 major errors so far . no idea if i will get this done in time and when i get done if i 'll have a cardigan or a layette ! one more error that causes me to rip it out and start over and i 'll find a new pattern or make my own . after spending $ 130 on angora yarn to make this gift , i 'm not going to give up , but the renewal notices i get for the magazine are promptly thrown out . update- still working on the cardigan , have pretty much had to start over and redesign the pattern on my own . still no correction online , but they have added many other corrections for other patterns from this issue . the corrections sometimes are little , simple ones , but some of the corrections are a total rewriting of the instructions or charts ! i have thrown out all of the magazines so i do n't get tempted to try another pattern from them
0	okay , so in touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is : a glossy tabloid . but just when you did n't think it was possible for the american tabloid press to dumb down any further , along came in touch weekly and us weekly . all in touch really is is a bunch of photographs . their writing is slop , fit for second graders , and it does n't go into much detail ( and we all know how amazingly `` accurate '' these tabloids are , anyway ) . want a quality tabloid ? read hello ! magazine ( from england ) . - donna di giacom
0	placed subscription order on 6/29 . it 's 8/16 today and i have yet to get my first issue . :
1	harper 's bazaar is the very best fashion and high style magazine out there , nothing compared to the always disappointing vogue . better fashions , editorials , articles that i actually want to read and keepsake editions that are just classics . the true bible if you want to be in style
0	the amazon ad said next day shipping . took over a month for the first magazine to arrive . do not buy this from amazo
1	i actually really love this magazine . the articles are down to earth and helpful ... not cheesy and shallow , like those found in cosmo . the editorial staff of lucky seems to really relate to real women and are n't `` bitchy and pretentious , '' like other women 's magazines
0	i like to read cook 's illustrated at the library . their magazine is much too expensive for the small amount of recipes included within . i like the tips sent in by readers , and some of the product reviews . i have found that most of their recipes are very involved -- nitpicky , to be kind . the lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried from their `` america 's test kitchen '' cookbook -- calls for cooking cornstarch in water , cooling it , and then beating the solution into the meringue . supposedly this keeps the meringue from destabilizing . all that happened in my kitchen was i found little lumps of cornstarch glue at the bottom of my mixing bowl while scraping out the meringue . i have made meringue before without cornstarch , and ca n't help thinking this is an extra step that is n't neccessary . their `` best '' brownies are good , but i can make equally good brownies without all the extra steps involved in melting chocolate and cooling it , etc . if you 're looking for easy , fool proof recipes , that do n't take a gazillion steps and are n't fussy about exactly what ingredients you use , this is n't the magazine for you
1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription . i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified . thanks so much
1	my students really enjoy this magazine . it always contains very humorous things that my students love . i teach students in grades 3 , 4 , and 5 and it is always checked out from my classroom library . i would recommend it to parents and students ( as long as they watch nickelodeon )
0	interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it 's not quite what i expected . with a title like `` interview '' i read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews . it turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine , but it 's not the only one . there is substantial space given to fashion , movies , and other areas , too . some of these columns are worth an occasional look , but they failed to grab my attention . the writers seem to play it safe , and that includes the interview section . they do n't ask many daring or controversial questions . they keep it simple , asking questions about an entertainer 's latest album or movie , without delving much into their personal lives . interview has many general annoyances . my greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents . about half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads , with fashion , liquor , beer , and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue . the ads are everywhere , with the majority in the front pages of each issue . the table of contents is buried , and i find this very frustrating . the contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page , then a few pages later , proceeds to the remainder of the contents , which is the regular monthly features . what 's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents . it varies from one issue to the next , falling somewhere in the first half . interview also varies greatly in length . some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long . the shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way , minus any metal . this magazine centers on entertainers , fashion , music , and the like . you wo n't find any interviews with politicians , businessmen , etc . interview sticks strictly to entertainers , and that includes the regular monthly columns . you wo n't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry . you will find only articles about the stars themselves . interview 's only saving grace is the photography . it would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing . but in many ways , the photos are overemphasized and there is n't enough substance to the magazine . the articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material . overall , interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material . my subscription was free , and i 'm thankful that it was . besides a few nice photos for clothing , there is n't much to make this magazine worth the cost .
1	harper 's , like the atlantic and the new yorker is written for those looking for more in-depth analysis and coverage on political and cultural affairs with a sampling of serious literary prose . personally i prefer the atlantic , which i read regularly , only picking up harper 's when i have time and something in it interests me , which is usually two or three times a year . just looking at the cover and pages inside convey harper 's as a serious tome , perhaps too serious for the casual reader , especially compared to the more colorful pages of the atlantic and playful new yorker cartoons . nevertheless , harper 's is an american icon in it 's genre having published many articles from great names since it 's inception in 1850 . a number of reviewers complain about it being left leaning and that stance clearly sprouts from the now recently departed editor lewis lapham , who has been an outspoken critic of the current administration . mr. lapham shares his views in a two page opinion piece and in the full page listing of various `` fun facts '' known as the harper 's index . serious readers will be able to get beyond this as simply a `` viewpoint '' and see the entire magazine for the serious writing that it is . i would contend this represents the best in `` critical analysis '' rather than bias . i would also simply suggest you view the other reviews made by people espousing this periodical as overly biased . for instance , at least one of those claiming liberal bias here is also praising an ann coulter book . so if you feel underwhelmed by the typical content you get even in a 60 minute broadcast or a political round table free-for-all and you 're interested enough in this magazine to read it 's reviews , you should probably pick up a copy of it for two or three months and give it a try . i recommend you also check out the new yorker and the atlantic to compare
0	i have subscribed to discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription . the magazine , which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag . from juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers op-ed page , the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash
1	less traditional , more imaginative . worth the extra $ $ $
1	this is my favourite car mag out there right now . it exceeds car by miles in terms of writing quality . i only have to say one thing : it 's cheaper to buy this at a local mega bookstore like boarders than to buy this online . it costs $ 9.99/issue so a year would cost $ 120 plus tax . i thought getting a subscription should save you money , not make you pay more ! !
0	i was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas . it is n't really , and there is n't really that much to this magazine . it is just another tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked at the august and september issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on elton john 's out of africa fundraiser and the article on julian mcmahon . the rest of it was ads , and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in vogue magazine , but the same old ads you 'll see anywhere else , and they are annoying . there were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it `` plastic person syndrome '' ) mark consuelos , waay too much on jennifer garner and her baby , and other weird things , such as the trend of designer cupcakes . i wish i was kidding on the latter , but i am not , nor do i have $ 25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is jessica alba 's favorite . there was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here . despite the size of this magazine , there is very little to sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos of the same old same old , and tips for mimicking them . i am not interested in becoming a teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested in seeing vanessa carlton 's pad . this magazine is for you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , a subscription that is actually not a year ( it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine ) and your life 's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in new york because some celebrity did . this magazine is mediocre at best , and the worst part is , it has the exact same fashion advice as vogue . i went with vogue because there is substance in their magazine , and the ads are classy and very chic . leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at aol time warner .
1	man this is it , great mag for cool business people . what you do not know , you will after reading all this great info . read on ! !
1	i purchased national geographic kids , your big bad yard , animal baby and ranger rick for a family of four children . they fight over each issue and now want renewals . how much better is this than a $ 20 toy for them , their parents and me ? how does it feel to have a child remind me in july that he loves his christmas gift ? immeasurable . there is no down side

1	the `` new yorker '' for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends . the articles are well written , though occasionally idiosyncratic . it is one of two magazines i subscribe to ( the other being the new yorker . ) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards , then this magazine will appeal to you . it is not gourmet or martha stewart ( not that i have a problem with either of those titles , this magazine is just different ) , but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice
0	i subscribed to this magazine for a year and found it a waste of money . every issue has a girl in a bikini on the front ( ca n't a woman look sexy in anything but ? ) and every issue claims to have `` the best ever exercise for ... . '' ok..what about the last 10 issues that claimed to have the same thing..those exercises are no longer `` best ever ? '' i did n't like the fashion sections , and i also do n't like how there really are n't any articles . when i subscribe to a magazine i 'd like to be able to read it , not just look at pictures . the only thing i liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive ... are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken ?
1	one of the funniest magazines around . in a recent article , the weekly standard proposed massively expanding the irs to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit . which group did the `` weekly standard '' say should be targeted for this increased irs presence ( and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100 % ) ? the entertainment industry . the reality tv show contestants , the teen-pop singers and the like . the article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry , but with all the people that really want fame , that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame , the industry would continue along ( i 'm curious if o'rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers ) . another o'rourke article provided the readers with an alternate inaugural address by bush ( subtitle : `` what if george w. bush were n't a compassionate conservative . . . `` ; quote : `` the media say that i won the election on the strength of moral values . if the other fellow had become president , would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values ? '' ) . in all seriousness , this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals ) . the magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective , and does not always agree with bush . another recent article was by a current liberal , ex-communist british writer and his reaction to george galloway 's testimony before the us senate . an editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in uzbekistan , an us ally in the war on terror . the editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine bush 's current foreign policy . it should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists , and few staff writers , most appear to be called `` contributing editors . '' it is jarring , though , when i read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions . `` variety '' and `` weekly standard '' rarely agree . for that matter , i 'm somewhat surprised by how often the `` weekly standard '' and `` business week '' disagree . - michael s. briggs -
1	i love to cook . i am not a professional by all means but i do enjoy the concept of preparing food . other than tv , `` bon appetit '' is one of my main sources i refer to that inspires me to create my next meal . i have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now . i have to admit i do n't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that i read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas . some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue ( i love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years ) and thanksgiving . what i am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end . from my point of view , a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make . i am blessed to live in a big city where i can find most of the ingredients but if i lived in a smaller city or town , it probably would be difficult to find . these recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed . all in all , i still enjoy reading `` bon appetit '' and being inspired by the magazine
1	as a subscriber to martha stewarts magazines i have to admit this has become my favorite , simply because its concise and interesting to boot . love the week end dinner section , as well as the recipe index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when i am looking for something quick to consider fixing , but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine . some of the other regular features that i like and find helpful are the cooking for one section , since as a widow i hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas . also like the wine basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that i now like trying . in season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season , which makes shopping and cooking easier . the size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so i can recheck it while shopping to see what items i have highlighted to pick up . this is also a great magazine for couples , singles of all ages , which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class , 2.5 children homes . and ... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue
1	has insightful articles about what 's hot in the business world . great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich . honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader . i would agree with one of the reviewers , however , that it tends to go off course . it has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive , but it 's mostly advertising . very disappointing . it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it ( which is why it got 2 stars from me ) , but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription
0	do n't get me wrong..i love the two hard cover books , real simple solutions and real simple : the guide to organized living . they are gems . however , the magazine simply betrays it 's words . as one rater stated , it seems like the reader is cajoled into buying un-needed expensive products , and my god..the magazine is cluttered with ads and inserts , plus it is very hard to turn the pages and read . i realize ads are necessary , but this is extreme , especially for a magazine that supposedly promotes a less complicated and cluttered life for it 's readers
0	i remember , not quite four years ago , when this magazine actually had pc substance and catered to a sophisticated pc-oriented market . now , it 's thin , hollow , interminably off-topic and ad-choked .
0	we subscribed to this for a school fundraiser . the first issue came november 13 with many useful coupons , only they expired in october 2006 ! i wish i could get my money back on a useless magazine filled with alot of advertising . if you want a decent health magazine , try prevention . they have alot more to offer than this rag . save your money , i wish i had ! take the time to search around . i hope this saves someone from making the mistake i had
1	this is by far the best photo magazine i have seen in my 40 years of being a photographer . ( and i subscribe to half a dozen ) . the reproduction is superb , and it offers a variety of genres without getting into the freaky stuff like aperture sometimes does . i have saved every issue i have received as if a book
0	back in the 1970 's my grandmother subscribed to prevention . at that time , it was a wonderful magazine , filled with informative articles aimed at the `` prevention '' of illness and the promotion of wellness ( as the founder of prevention , j.i . rodale had preached ) . articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time . ( j.i . can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream ) . over the years , and especially after the tragic death of robert rodale ( j.i . 's son ) , and the takeover by his wife and daughter , it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy , tabloid-like `` women 's magazine '' with scantily clad women on the covers , and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat . i think j.i . rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be . i flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note , as another reviewer has stated , plenty of ads for drugs which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place ( whereas the old prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods ) . i do n't know why the rodale family does n't just scrap the title and call it something else , but alas , they are a major corporation now and i have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon
1	the week always seems to reflect at least three sides to every major story
1	fantastic collection of all areas of graphic design . a must for the reference library
0	bad journalism and plenty of adds ... .if you like to exoticize black people then this is your mag ... ..nothing to be gained here except maybe the cost
0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage , and recent years have only accelerated this trend . in the 60s and 70s , it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend ( originally it was considered quite conservative ) , but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance . as for its being part of the `` liberal '' media , this is inaccurate . recent coverage of the ( 2004 ) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person . the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered , except for one very brief article listing a few `` fact check '' points . instead , the cover story wa about new products and movies , a kind of sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan . it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election , but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office . in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment . the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush , but it 's still mostly bland and superficial . your money is better spent on the british magazine `` the economist '' which is far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint is conservative , it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics . `` the economist '' also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach to the news . time can still be entertaining to read , but i would n't take what they say too seriously . they tend to bend with the political wind
1	equipment , technology , technique and clothing : this magazine has it all . any tip that helps the amateur photographer capture and improve his or her scenic , travel and wildlife images can be found within its monthly pages
0	please read naomi jakobs ' review for relevant magazine below . it captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the christian 'post-modern ' kick . if you have to go out of your way to claim you 're a celebrity , then you simply are n't a celebrity ( take `` fitness celebrity '' john basedow for example ) . in the same way , if you have go out of your way to claim that the post-modern evangelical movement is relevant , then you 're claim for relevancy is simply not credible . the christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years . however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity is n't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when sandi patty or carmen ruled the christian top 40 . does the fact that some christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable
1	i received my first magazine , it is n't glossy or flashy , but is full of in-depth info , which is exactly what i wanted . not very thick for the money , but i 'm still satisfied due to the quality of the content .
0	good housekeeping does not send a notice to the person receiving the subscription in a timly manner . it should n't take 2 to 3 weeks to receive notification
1	instyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible . the features are very informative and fun . i enjoy the man of style feature and the entertaining guide best ! for more on mags , visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com
1	this mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality . it 's an icon all over the world . the editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism . she and vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent . without vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry
0	my mom was a subscriber to newsweek for years , and i 'd flip through her copies . most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be ( although , not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail . so much for `` protecting our freedoms '' ) . anyway , since newsweek is beholden to big business advertisements , it wo n't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns . if people are interested in more honest , more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world ( the neoliberalism of the us empire and other wealthy nations ) , then i 'd recommend z magazine . i 'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it 's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize . z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet , noam chomsky ( another figure i 'm sure the us soldier thinks should be in jail . although , chomsky recently spoke at west point . so , even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings ) .
0	i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents ' subscription . it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about . frankly , the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack ; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters . a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers -- to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story -- any future coverage is designed to prove time 's initial position correct . the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event ; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories -- '' we told you so , we told you so . '' even worse , the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story . ca n't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn ? out of sight , out of mind is the mantra ... in fact , i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media ; newspapers are failing , television news ca n't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis . neutrality is dead . frankly , i do n't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant . time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states -- no more . iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page . african states are making vast strides towards democracy , we get an article about nigerian computer fraud . russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy , but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq . japan , one of the world 's most influential cultures , in the week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein 's puerile take on pornography and social deviants . but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks : how in the hell did our world become boring ? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer ? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage -- educate the reader about the world in which we live ; do n't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week . time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine , if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
0	first off i have to ask amazon what keeps happening to my reviews ? if one is too critical of a product do they get deleted ? as a peace corps volunteer i am a forced subscriber of this rag . that should upset every american taxpayer that foots the bill for this garbage . i would like to pint out also that peace corps volunteers ( not your most conservative bunch ) has continually lobbied to get rid of this magazine in favor of the economist . every week i receive my copy and page through it for 5 minutes . it then hits the burn pile or the trash bin ( which ultimately gets burned ) . i literally feel dumber every time i try to read an article that looks interesting . they have six page articles with all kinds of diagrams and illustrations that end up revealing far less than a 3 paragrah story that the economist presents on the same topic . i am just waiting for when news weak starts introducing pop ups for their thought weak readers . as a former soldier i was enraged that the irresponsible and criminal reporting ( koran desecration ) of this magazine caused the deaths and injuries to so many . newsweak 's cowardly apology made me want to puke . to the editors and writers that allowed that piece to go to print i hope it haunts your memories forever . why you are not rotting in prison i will never know . freedom of the press carries with it a responsibility to facts and is not a license for editors to print whatever they want . one can not scream `` fire '' in a crowded theater and then try to hide behind their first ammendment rights when there turns out to be no fire . the economists this magazine hires seem to have been kicked out of the london school of economics for being even too liberal for their tastes . hey , if you have n't seen the obituary from the 70 's keynesian economics is dead . the cause was failure to stand up to free market realities . looking for credible and up to date articles in this publication is akin to watching scrambled porn in the hopes of seeing some skin . even if you do see something it will be so distorted you wo n't know what it is that you are actually seeing . do yourself a favor and get something else . the economist , the wall street journal , hell you will be better informed if you consult a magic 8 ball , anything but newsweak would be better . well almost anything , in newsweak 's defense they do not normally subscribe to conspiracy theories or decry the so called corporate controlled media as do other journals of utter nonsense . this magazine is liberal propaganda disguised as journalism . the really sad thing is that people that read this think they are informed on world events . do yourself a favor and go to a newstand and read an economist . one warning though , intelligent writing and sticking to facts and reality is highly addictive .
1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements , but that 's the trade-off for this very affordable , high quality publication . i 'm not sure i 'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads , but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color , layout and accessorizing that i can use , and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style .
0	reason once had two things going for it . it articulated principled libertarianism , and it was a consistently interesting magazine . now its ideology is fuzzy ; certainly not consistently libertarian . it is also dull and aimless , often badly written . case in point : the current issue as i write includes a defense of the fda by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians , and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements , as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry . the `` old '' reason would never have published such a piece . nor would reason have previously published ronald bailey 's article advocating mandatory health insurance . bailey also supports the iraq war and psychiatric coercion . a bright spot continues to be the writing of jacob sullum
1	the coverage always seems nice and varied -- there are the elaborate , `` took me a week to prepare '' meals alongside the quick throw-together meals , and helpful side notes about products and ingredients . i also like the tangential coverage for dining out , wine , and travel ( to good food places !
1	simply put , this is a great magazine ! i have been a continuous subscriber for the last five years , and country gardens always deliver . the lay out is easy to follow and is not overridden with advertisement . the articles are quite enjoyable and informative . of course there are plenty of gorgeous photos to suppliment the articles . god , i love that ! i too wish that this was a monthly publication . however , i will not complain . i do n't want to see a good thing ruined . so , i simply look forward to each issue and settling down for some great gardening articles , diagrams , advice and photos . hats off to the meredith corporation for their consistency in excellence ! this magazine continues to give . go on , get yourself a subscription ! you will love it ! five stars all the way
1	long time msl subscriber . i get out my dec , dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such . i loved the cookie issue last year , definite keeper . her projects involve time and materials , but you end up with something that will last , and instructions are generally very clear . i 've seen that since her trial/jail , the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out , which means adds for average joes , like me . i really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject , even if its not a particular fave of mine . i have n't really watched the martha show much , i really enjoyed the original msl show she started with . sometimes i get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to new york and similiar , but c'est la vie
0	i just received a first-time correspondence from kids discover threatening referral to a credit agency for copies of a magazine that we did n't order and have n't received . there is no telephone number to call and only a p.o . box to correspond with . i suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble . i sent a notice to the consomer complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record
0	this magazine is just page after page of hollywood p.r . agencies releases . unbelievable . why did n't i think of it ? i know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources , but other than a few pages of very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes and prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again and again and again . this magazine must not have a staff of writers , but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . the funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by , say , tom cruise 's management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , did n't you get the press release ? if you tivo extra and have the theme to entertainment tonight as your ringtone , this magazine is right up your alley . otherwise , do n't waste a penny on this nonsense .
1	my son had been wanting a suscription to a gamers mag and going off of the reviews i ordered this one and he thinks its great . he is 13 if you are interested
1	this magazine is fun and upbeat . the pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text . if the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying . there are many many recipes . one section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week . a great magazine . well worth the money .
0	still have not received an issue yet . please give me an update as to when the first one will arrive

0	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year-old grandson . for some reason ziff-davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine . ( dec 27 , 2005 , p 122 if you want to check it out ) . previous issues had partial page ads selling `` sex pheremones '' which i could almost overlook , but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line .
0	i received my first `` issue '' of modern bride in the mail yesterday . it was just the cover of the magazine , nothing else ! now i 'll have to go through the trouble of ordering a replacement . do yourself a favor and just go to a news stand and buy one
0	i 've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time , but they 've finally hit bottom . the bulk of the april 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars . yes , todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized , but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops . pc mag has been drifting far afield , doing articles on apple computers , gaming systems , and extensive reviews on cameras . instead of pcs , the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it , or is in some way remotely related to computers . the obvious inference is that there 's nothing interesting going on in the pc world , so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages . i find that hard to believe ; i think it 's more likely that the staff has lost their focus , or they 've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about pcs . the lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent . what used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of time magazine . they now have a `` new look '' , and it 's awful . their readership used to consist of well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people do n't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , with cutesy `` handwritten '' notes belaboring the obvious . that 's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans . compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago , and it 's obvious that they 've `` dumbed down '' the entire magazine . i 've subscribed to pc magazine for years , and considered it a `` must read '' to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the pc world . but no more -- it 's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of personal computers .
0	this definitely a magazine for gearheads . it 's pretty much just equipment reviews and advertisements . i would have given it a higher rating but for two things : 1 ) i do n't think i 've ever seen popular photography not love any piece of equipment . the reviews can still be useful if you 're just wondering what features the new gizmo has , but still , they ought to be a bit more critical if they 're going to be such a review based magazine . 2 ) many of the ads are from vendors with bad reputations . i believe they make some sort of claim about requiring a certain level of honesty from anyone they sell ad space from , but it sure does n't look like they have ever kicked anyone out of the magazine to me . so what do you have when you have a magazine full of uncritical reviews , the occasional beginnerish article about technique , and a lot ads from stores of dubious virtue ? at best a 2 star magazine
1	`` as we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness , we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people . '' ~p.g . wodehouse , something new creative advertising ( love the ge firefly ad ) , practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of real simple . there i was wondering when i should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer . they also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with liz claiborne home items , like the lovely bedding and towels . the do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles . loved the articles like `` organizing your recipes ; 8 foolproof methods . '' but their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes ! hello . there are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep . they always seem to put a spin on old favorites , like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant . the applesauce cake in the november issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples . ~the rebecca review
1	this magazine is absolutely wonderful . after receiving my first copy , i went to their website and backordered about 10 copies ... excellent reading and information regarding ideas on what people are doing to successfully make money off of your land ... alpacas , flower growing , chickens , small and larger animal livestock , etc ! lots of neat advertisements too , on things you just didnt know existed ... ..i will never be without this magazine , it is inspirational
1	this magazine has beautiful pictures , heartwarming stories and as a bonus , a laugh or two . it covers the countryside of all of the united states and reminds you of a slower , more genteel time . it makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself . if you long for life outside of the city , you 'll enjoy this obvious labor of love
1	yes , i know it 's weird that i like reading maxim . but maxim has inspired me of doing my job . i 'm glad that amazon sell its subscription . it 's fantastic . my husband loves it too . it 's not just the sexy hot women covers , but also what 's inside . informative , complete , and relevant
0	leading on what ? innovation , quality articles , coverage , reader satisfaction ? no sir . profit from advertising , volume sales , high percentual of biased articles ? most likely . unfortunately , to boost profits rodale press is up to anything , like rerun of old articles to save money and misleading `` special advertising '' sections . if you are into mt . biking , there are better magazines out there ( mountain biking magazine is not one of them , of course ) . if your thing is road biking , sorry , there is nothing else except racing magazines . as we know , america is about vehicles that waste energy , like high-powered cars , motorcycles and boats ( just count the number of magazines about them next time you stop at your favorite bookstore )
0	i have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed
1	this is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement . beyond the great ideas , they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures . i have learned how to do a great number of things i used to hire others to do because i thought i did n't have the skills - they make most projects around the house seem accessible , but not by oversimplifying the process . some may argue that they give too much detail , but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced . the only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed !
0	i love the mag , but sister never recieved the order i gave her as a gift ! ! !
1	i like the magazing because it fits my lifestyle . it keeps it real with the in your face articles . the fluff is perfect for this style of magazine and i look forward to every issue for the new product info alone . the kick a $ $ ladies do n't hurt either.i have subscriptions to stuff , fhm , and maxim until 2010 and to me worth every penny
0	hi , i am sure i will love it , but i ordered it on feb. 15th . and still have n't received the magazine . maybe it is just published every few months . i do look forward to receiving the magazine . sincerely , becky watkin
1	needed . it 's just as informative as macworld but more fun too read . to me macworld is like reading a text book while mac addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor . i especially like the do-it-yourself projects that macaddict walks you through each month . they range in difficulty from how to build your own mac os x icons , to how to program your own video game in visual basic , to how to void your warrantee by soldering crazy stuff to the motherboard . these guys are seasoned mac geeks and they are n't afraid to help you become one too . if you 're a super sensitive person , macaddict may rub you the wrong way . sometimes their editors make jokes that draw hate mail from the readers , like when the polish editor in chief cracks polish jokes . i do n't mind these silly things , but some might . to me all of the jokes usually help their articles make a more concrete and lucid point . throughout the year macaddict has special issues devoted to topics like maintenance , practical jokes , digital media , preventing disasters , detailed os x guides , etc . i find these invaluable . i 'm the guy my friends ask for mac help , not because i 'm smarter than other people , but because i 've been reading this great magazine for 6 year
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month . `` divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act . everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical . if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife , her happiness will be more important to him than his own . setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be , is the ultimate expression of love . '' dennis j. schleicher
1	this magazine is truly outstanding ! it is very informative and only rarely makes mistakes ! i love the indepth and informative articles that they provide . i also love the way that they always have such clear and beautiful pictures and there is no shortage of them either ! i also love the fact that all of the articles are in line with mainstream science
0	do n't purchase subscriptions from amazon or magazine express . the following are my experiences with a subscription to hiragana times from amazon . what this page does n't tell you is that the japanese magazines subscribed to on amazon are filled by a company called magazine express and are shipped seamail from japan which mean you 'll recieve every issue 8 to 10 after it 's released . i placed my order in january and , to date , have not recieved a single issue . after several phone calls , the magazine express people ( who fill the amazon subscriptions ) said they had to restart my subscription for the may issues which will take 8-10 weeks due to shipping issues . so after ordering in january , i will not receive a single issue of this uncancelable magazine until possibly in late july . very poor service . this is unacceptable for a magazine that most us japanese bookstores ( fujisan is one ) can get within a week or that you can order directly from the publisher for only a few dollars more . if i had known the shipping policy i would not have ordered and the magazine supplier , magazine express will not cancel the subscrition . i advise avoiding all amazon magazine subsriptions due to their poorly stated policies . **update , i wrote this review in june . it is now july 8th and i 've just been informed i must wait until august 15th to see if an issue arrives . i ordered the magazine on january 9th and i have had no resolution from either magazine express or amazon who provides no way to contact anyone within amazon about magazine orders . i reiterate , buying magazines from amazon if a poor idea
0	after falling in love with gourmet 's yellow cookbook , i subscribed to gourmet , hoping for the same great classic recipes and commonsense commentary . wow , what a disappointment . i have just received my second issue and , as another reviewer said , it is about 90 % ads for high-end luxury goods like jewelry and cars . the 6-page `` special advertisement section '' stops being so special when there are 20 of them in one issue ! what happened , ruth reichl ? the few recipes that one can find are unattractive and/or too difficult for even weekend cooking . for those cooks looking for a great cooking magazine , i highly recommend bon appetit over gourmet : the majority of the magazine is recipes and cooking tips , with only interspersed ads . i will be calling to see if i can get my subscription switched tomorrow .
1	*fashion tips for girls of all sizes and styles ( preppy , sporty , punk , etc . ) *make-up tips *stories about girls experiences with abuse , guy trouble , etc
0	it has been several weeks and still no magazine from money ! ! ! ! oh yeah but they did remember to bill my credit card in a timely fashion ... .maybe when something takes over a month you should bill the person when u ship the product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	on any list of pure english-language business reportage , barron 's would figure in the top ten . this newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication . though 'fluff ' is not a word commonly associated with the wall street journal , think of barron 's as 'wsj without the fluff ' . that 's how focused it is . electronic availability of business numbers has pushed barron 's off the 'must read ' list , though it has its guild of old faithful readers who consider nothing else its equal . published by dow jones , it is as focused on wall street as any publication could be . business people appreciate its 'review preview ' section , which at a glance brings a reader up to speed on last week 's business news leaders and next week 's announcement and world holidays affecting business . wsj and the economist will give you more extensive analysis . without slighting its columns and feature articles , barron 's is for the pure numbers guys and gals among us . they 're all in here . honest
0	this is my favorite magazine in the universe and the only one to which i have ever subscribed . however , after this , my second subscription is over , i plan to call it quits . the magazine never gets delivered unless i send several angry e-mails every month reminding them and demanding delivery . when the issues come they are often 2-3 months behind . the current issue is over three weeks late and who knows when and if i will ever see it . in the end , although this is a brilliant publication , it simply is n't worth the headache . photo , if you 're out there , please forward me the june issue ... . and while you 're at it get a head start on july and august and maybe they 'll make it on time
1	i absolutely adore elle decoration - as several other reviewers have noted , unfortunately , the american version ca n't compare . the spaces are gorgeous , and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious . all of my american magazines ( with the exception of interior design ) get ripped apart , with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed - elle decoration always gets saved in its entirety . i highly recommend - these magazines are eye candy , and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import .
0	during the 1960 's , when my sister subscribed to ahmm , the stories mirrored the fantastic television show ; the stories were primarily mysterious , creepy , and unique , with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great . now , the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain , uninteresting `` detective '' stories . i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's , but stopped because of the same old boring `` cops and robbers '' material . i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop , but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed . subscribe only if you are a fan of pure `` police '' fiction
1	natural home offers advice for practical and affordable ways to make your home comfortable and healthy while being earth friendly . i am continually amazed at the beauty of the rooms and homes in this wonderful magazine
0	i would n't know if this was a good magazine , i have yet to receive it , after waiting three months . it is cheaper to order through food and wine website anyway
0	it would be nice if i were writing about the magazine content here but since i never received a single copy of my subscription.all i can say is their customer service sucks ! ! ! ! after repeated attempts to correct the delivery address or find out what happened the issue still has n't been resolved . note ; i 've had a number of delivery problems when ordering magazines on amazon ( there might be some glitch ) .however the other magazines have quickly corrected the problem soon after contact .
0	this is a good magazine for the home cook that wants to branch-out from the standard family circle or good housekeeping no risk recipes . my big problem with this company is once they 've got your contact information , you will receive more junk mail than you thought one company could generate ; hawking every single publication they produce , relentlessly . i stopped subscribing and it took a year to stop receiving their snail spam ; and there 's no way to 'opt out ' onlin
1	car and driver is definitely the best automotive magazine in the world . this magazine has something for everybody , whether your a person just looking for a new car or a serious car enthusiast . i have been a car and driver sucscriber for 6 years now and i regularly purchase the other three popular , monthly car magazines ( motor trend , road track , and automobile ) . by far car and driver is the best of the four , testing more automobiles per issue ( about least twice as many as road track per year ) , conducting larger comparison tests , and generally being the most enjoyable . car and driver is also greater fun to read as the editors are very prone to jokes and wisecracks , and not afraid to write how they really feel about a car , no matter how good or bad it is . the road tests are comprehensive with a long list of tests performed for every vehicle , and the good points and bad points listed along with a sentence summary of the vehicle . all the reviews are unbiased ( mostly ) , and all vehicles are compared to similar cars in the same class . the bottom line : if you want a magazine that tests more motor vehicles than any other american car magazine , prints accurate specifications and performance tests results on each one , and includes autosport articles and up to date auto news , yet you do n't want to fall asleep reading it , car and drvier is the magazine for you .
1	i enjoy the vibe of this magazine.the q 's are truly interesting to me to say the least overall.very entertaining has a up-front vibe on things.not like other magazines that is for sure
0	the legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when `` the gramophone '' was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music . whether or not that legend is true ( i 'm too young to know ) , gramophone 's time has definitely passed . today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet , from newsgroups to websites . some of it is less well-informed than gramophone 's criticism , but some of it is more well-informed . what is undeniable is that , for the price of a few mouse-clicks , it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the internet than gramophone ( with its british-based critics ) can offer . what is more , gramophone is tied to a business-model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete . historically , the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so-called `` major '' companies such as emi , deutsche grammophon and cbs ( later sony ) . these `` majors '' would buy lavish advertising spreads in gramophone and so finance the magazine . in return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors ' new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors . today the situation is different . the most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a mp3 on an obscure russian website than on a new cd from sony . small companies , dedicated solely to classical music recordings , produce great results on shoestring budgets while the `` major '' corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems for gramophone 's business model . the new players in the classical music industry do n't have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . with gramophone 's implicit bargain : `` advertise with us or we wo n't review your recordings '' , the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant . if you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical , i recommend `` international record review '' or `` fanfare '' . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most of all , i suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet
0	this is the worst magazine i have ever subscribed too . i hated it so much after the first issue that when new ones came , i thru it right in the trash . here why : 1- ad after ad for dietary supplements ( like dexatrim and stacker ) which i think cheapins the creditablity of the magazine b/c true health doesnt come from a bottle . 2- many pics of overly built up women ( think fitness competitions ) ... not something the average women can aspire too ... and too me , is nasty looking . 3-the information that was in it is general information that anyone with common sense already know ! my advice to you , avoid this magazine , unless you like body building or like looking at body builders
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life . instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images , people we will never meet , and in many cases people who have very little going for them . does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything , or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence ? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j.lo is engaged ( in order to get on the cover of another magazine ) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns
1	muse magazine is in a class by itself . it has no advertisements , no articles about how to make yourself prettier or any other boring stuff that shallow teens care about . we musers love the focus on science and math , and they 've replaced the original mythological muses with 9 of their own . these little cartoons litter the margins with their witty comments , making the rare tedious article funny . receiving this magazine is your ticket into the close-knit community of musers , kids who have openness and learning at the heart of all their doings . get muse
1	instyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible . the features are very informative and fun . i enjoy the man of style feature and the entertaining guide best ! for more on mags , visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com
1	i 'm pretty critical and picky about the magazines i read and elle is one of the few that raise the standards . a lot of the information given , whether its clothes or advice , is very practical
0	the amazon ad said next day shipping . took over a month for the first magazine to arrive . do not buy this from amazo
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give . this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up . too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out - every 10 year old 's top priority right ? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue - magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span . better off with american girl magazine - this one 's to mature for younger girls .
1	when i was little , my dad always said good things about this magazine . my attitude was always `` i 'm not gon na buy a magazine to bore myself some more '' - i mean , c'mon , it 's a history magazine . i was absolutely wrong . i picked up this magazine one day and i was hooked . i would say that american heritage has found its way to make history interesting . one way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest ( as subtle as they may be ) into its articles . on the second thought , i should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he 's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not . this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so that i could finish my copy in one sitting . it 's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months . american heritage makes history grrreattt ! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20 's like myself
0	please see tj-mccarthy 's review elsewhere here ; he is , to borrow a phrase from across the pond , spot-on in his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription to pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor , jim louderback , has dropped the old tagline on the front cover , `` an independent guide to technology '' . i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is , in fact , just a marketing vehicle for various products . if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing , stay away from this publication
0	this magazine fell apart so quick . they are no longer a unbias magazine . instead they are a interscope propaganda machine . just look at the covers ? every year shady/g-unit gets a automatic 8 covers . every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings . even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop . as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt . i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag
0	this mag needs a new editor . i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months . maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests
1	although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old , my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine . she has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation . not only are the stories lively and entertaining , they are educational as well ( i am also learning various things about history and culture that i did not know before ! ) . there is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry . since receiving this magazine , i have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills . these reasons are why i believe it is well worth the money and i wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time .
1	car and driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine . it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track , which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world , and magazines like motor trend , which focus on the more practical . the magazine is always a fun , intereseting read , and keeps you up to date on teh auto world . i must , however , say , that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend , and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track ( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography . )
0	if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would . when vibe was introduced , it was a relevant , interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative , r and hip hop artists . the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who 's hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world . lately i 've noticed that it 's nothing more than a fluffy version of the source . i hate a lot of new rap music that 's out and did n't appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover . and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over , all of the female r singers ' covers and stories are horrible ( we wo n't even discuss that disgusting brandy cover ) ! this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i 'm in line at the grocery store . yes , the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking . i 'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription
1	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better . it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time ... just from what i 've observed anyway . i like the layouts , they have good ideas , great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking
1	jeff goldblum 's character in `` the big chill '' said that he could n't write an article longer than the average person could read during a , er , `` trip to the library '' ( wink , wink , nudge , nudge , know what i mean ? ) . the writers at details seems to have the same marching orders . in these hectic times , maybe that 's not so bad . the articles i have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized . i actually finished the entire magazine between pm mail delivery and breakfast the next day . the topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns . and , again , they cover the topics in very few , well-written pages . i do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age , that could be tunnel-vision ( grey hair , i remember filmore east , you get the picture ? ) . my suggestion , take a look . it 's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you .
1	first , i received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives , and gives , and gives . this magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen , on the grill , around the house , in my garden , in the state as well as all through the south for traveling . being a woman who moved from the detroit suburbs to florida so i could be with ailing family , i was really a duck out of my elements . i had no idea of what was where within the state ; what are good places to visit , where are some of the great attractions outside of orlando , the keys , and the everglades and who does what where . in this magazine , there are sections devoted just to florida ( which i suspect they do for each state per subscription ) -- what to plant when , what festivals are going on , what 's hot and what 's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state i live in . and that 's not all ... not only do i get to learn more about where i am today , i can explore and learn about where i 'd like to go tomorrow . one month , it 's `` welcome to alabama '' and all the wonderful gems it has to offer . another month , i am poring over beautiful georgia . a different topic ? seafood of the south . how would you like to learn about fantasic , but yet unknown , places for bargains and great finds ? now - i am also an avid cook at home - and i can not tell you how much i love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine . how many differnt ways have i learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission ! i have learned so much more about grilling , vegetable side dishes , breakfast treats and savories from all over the south , tempting , lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between . i have always known the south was the jewel of the states when it came to cooking - but w.o.w ! so much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill . and it is a great compliment to what i learn from other books , the food channel , and beyond . it speaks to where i live , what i can get down here , and what the heck plantains are anyway : - ) i love looking through many of the decorating ideas , the travel tips , and vignettes of different states , or towns , or themes . the only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than i can in the way of travel , decorating , etc . i am more simple , down-to-earth folk , and do not share much with `` decorating your summer cottage '' , or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise , or splurge excursion . sometimes , and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me i am not going to be able to relate to everything , i am not the crowd they are talking to . otherwise , this magazine is a 10 in my book : - ) well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month 's `` explorations ''
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants . there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all . if you consider yourself a 'foodie ' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine , then this magazine might be for you . if , however , you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .
1	i 've been reading men 's journal since the first issue . i 've always enjoyed its mix of content . mj interviews a wide range of interesting individuals . over the years i 've incorporated some of the workout tips from mj 's fitness pages into my workout routine . i especially enjoy reading the product reviews . the travel recommendations are always well written , if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers ( myself included ! ) . overall , men 's journal offers a great mix of well written content
0	i found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing . that 's about it . this mag seems to be biased towards certain products & amp ; manufacturers . they neglected to open my eyes wider . the reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they do n't give credit to smaller , better , less-well-known companies and technologies . all the info is pretty basic for intro users , but if that 's what you are interested in ... then this is a great non-comlicated publication
0	esquire is a subpar men 's magazine , in my opinon . more than half of the magazine is advertisements , and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking . if you like ads and cologne samples , pick it up . after all , it is pretty decently priced
1	in christmas of 2005 i decided i wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there . but which ones to pick ? after buying one here and there i found three that i absolutely love . saveur was one . the recipes are nice though some i would n't touch with a ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients that do n't appeal to me ) . but the stories and the pictures ... they are n't just amazing , they 're astounding ! where national geographic talks about certain things or places , saveur takes you to different places and shows you what 's there and how they eat . they showed me ireland and i even made colcannon ( a mashed potato and cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made a french dish last night that was amazing . it was a little time consuming but worth it ! i do have admit i was a little disappointed with my first issue i received from them with my subscription . it looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it . it 's readable but i was n't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers . i 've never seen them . but i have been getting my magazines and they look good . i was thinking about it the other night , my three magazines i picked ... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating ( eating well ) , one was easier recipes with no articles ( everyday food ) , and then saveur . if i could only pick one to keep ... it would be saveur . it 's really that good of a read .
1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine . the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them . most articles are rather pretentious and boring . in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting . and it only had two articles which were worth it . the first was `` robbed blind '' which was about rfid chips and the second article was `` diy ways to go green ''
0	good housekeeping does not send a notice to the person receiving the subscription in a timly manner . it should n't take 2 to 3 weeks to receive notification
0	well , imagine my surprise when i picked up the february 2004 issue , and found that things had drastically changed . mainly in the editor 's letter . it used to be 1 page , now it 's just a small little column now , that is exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now the redesign isnt as bad as other zd game mags , but the removal of the 1 page editor 's letter , really steams me up . at least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey 's scorched earth column . it 's still 1 page . it 's on the last page usually . and yes the redesign is really bad in terms of readability . most of the time they have a red or blue or yellow background , and it 's really hard to read the text at times . now at least their disc will auto-load , unlike pc gamer . and what really pisses me off , is when a magazine has a hot 100 section , or a best pc 's or videocards , or peripherals section , and they hardly ever change the captions or descriptions come with it . i 'm sorry if i got off track a lot , but i felt the need to . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor 's and the editor-in-chief was re-assigned to become the editor-in-chief of the official xbox magazine . the new eic of pcg is the former executive editor , and i hate him , so this is why i say cgw is now the best pc games magazine
1	this magazine provides interesting stories and information about american history and cultural life . most often it is very pleasant reading .
1	i 've received the whole dog journal for the past year . i have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements . it 's pure holistic news , information , health , nutrition , training , food testing , and anything else pertaining to dogs ! i would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned . one thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing . it 's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date , helpful , and necessary . with the whole dog journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge
1	this magazine is ... well ... sweet . i love it . i picked up a subscription in january and i think it 's great . they get previews on a ton of games , even those that are n't that gossiped about . they bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews . they get a scoped up article on new games very fast . they 're not centered on only the good games , but they also include a `` shame of the month '' ( lowest scoring game of the month ) award . they include three scores from a scale of 1-10 and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks . they have full coverage on new platforms and games . they also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses . this magazine is alot better than the dragonball z obssessed , gamepro . its fast and relibel . definetly a great buy .
0	i am utterly disappointed in the direction that gamepro has taken over the past two years . i actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year , but came back to the 20 issues for $ 10 at their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but the magazine is really bad . one thing i laugh is , the retro corner . they have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before , and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago . i think the most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue was around 100 . and do n't try to tell me they 've lost 40 pages in advertising . too bad on-line reviews and websites , are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines . i 'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life . or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low , i ca n't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort . you guys were pretty good 5 years ago , but you 've gone to pot these past two years ! i 'm talkin ' to you watchdawg ! ! ! you guys are suckin ' lately ! ! ! mc white said : you guys are suckin ' ! !
1	i highly recommend highlights for children . it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way . watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles , hidden pictures , games , and fun and entertaining stories . cynthia marie rizzo , author of julie and the unicorn
1	ok. for those of you who continue to believe that new york is the center of the united states , hell , the world , who forgot the map cnn kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that might infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the us , for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest , the dark states , middle earth , the elba of the 21st century , you 're not . there 's a whole world out here . people have jobs . yes , it 's true . we work , send our kids to school , even go to church on sundays . and on other days too . we vote . oh , yeah , you already know that . so having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates , is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with ashley or uma or diane , you know , it just does n't carry a lot of weight with the serfs . but . . . . it 's a great magazine . andy lives . photography is tight and realistic . the ads are sexy and provocative . the sidebars interesting and insightful . it 's wordly . it covers music as well as rs . it 's ( do n't get all riled up now ) a fun magazine to read . however , the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine , seem to be along the lines of 'damn , it 's so good to be me and i guess you 're ok too . ' or , 'i see you 're wearing a $ 15,000 versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you 've selected old , black , converse all stars to wear with it ! how noveau ! how tasteful ! ' come on . where 's the bite ? where 's the interview with alex rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it 's only new york ? ' or with marv alpert 'hey what 's on your fashion agenda now ? ' chris berman from espn says he was on maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into steven stills with his kids . now that 's a conversation i would have liked to hear , not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation ( it sure is n't an interview - see columbia university 's interviewing 101 in their school of journalism ) are off to pick out furniture . it 's new york . show your teeth . flex . 5 stars . larry scantlebury
1	as a library administrator i get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines . i have been a personal subscriber to woodworker 's journal for a year now , and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years . in that time i have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine . is it my favorite ? no , but i still like it well enough to recommend it to others . i also regularly read fine woodworking , workbench , wood , popular woodworking , etc . and like all of those , this magazine has its strengths . i find that wj is very into power tools , tool reviews ( theirs are among my favorites ) , and shop projects . having said all of that , i also must confess that the best piece of furniture i ever built came from a plan in wj magazine ( an arts crafts style wine storage table ) , so do n't pigeon-hole it too much . try it for a year and i bet you wo n't be sorry !
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen . that was a bad decision . after having received two issues , i continue to be disappointed . the quality of the art design , and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky . i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine .
0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
0	i am sure this will be a great magazine , but i have not received my first issue yet
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov. 6 , 2005 . its now feb. 22nd , 2006 and the magazines ( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american ) are nowhere to be seen . of course , my account was quickly charged and at this pace , i 'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them ... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine , it might be a better idea to get somewhere else..
1	well i echo what all the other reviews have said about this magazine . subscibing to this magazine is making sure that unbiased articles can still exist for all makes and models of sports cars . you see there are extremely few ads in this magazine and so even though the mag is a bit smaller than say a car and driver magazine it is loaded front to back with reviews . one after another . the photography is fantastic and just looking at the pictures makes you wonder what some of the other mainstream magazines could be like if they could just try to put out a better quality product . even the cardstock of the paper is first rate . it makes the car and driver mag feel so cheap in comparison . both come to my address and i honestly can say that i look forward to both but for different reasons . i first stumbled upon this magazine at an airport 6 years ago and i am so glad that i did . i would love to see more articles with affordable sports car alternatives as they print at the end of each issue . i remember an article about what used sports cars you could buy with certain dollar amounts and this was to me ( a man on a budget ) a rather nice look at the market as a whole that year . also we are not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing to this magazine so it would be nice to see road tests on at least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue . thank you for putting together such a high quality magazine for your readers to enjoy .
0	i was one of entertainment weekly 's charter subscribers way back in 1990 . it started out great -- a different , intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage . but financially , things were shaky , so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience . i could n't blame the editors . it helped them reach the needed tipping point , and they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus , and i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew has fallen off a cliff . it has become entirely superficial and shallow , with hardly any substance at all . the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format . i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience . so , i 've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be
0	this magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products . their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is . when they do focus on the best work of the design community , their examples are puzzling . they choose work that is often genuinely awful , and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows ( comarts , adc , graphis , aiga , one club ) . while that would be admirable had they found other good work , most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best . there is a reason this magazine is free

1	men 's health magazine provides informationand tips on men 's fitness , health , sex , career , relationships , nutrition , recipes , weight loss and muscle building.no matter how much you know about men 's health , there 's always room to know more about ways to a better lifestyle , the top men 's health concerns , and the importance of getting medical care and regular screening tests.so you deserve to pay more attention to yourself ! take better care of yourself physically , mentally , and emotionally . or if you are a woman searching for ways to help the men in your life , tell them about the men 's health . one way to start is to use the resources you 'll find in the magazine here.this magazine is dealing with all aspects of the daily lives .
0	where are the critiques ? the articles lack any critical substance . whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed . it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype , vibe will go along with the flow . on top of that , there are more ads now than ever before . even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space .
1	sports car international never loses focus on its mission : providing insight into everything that defines a true sports car . i do not need to waste time flipping past crossover reviews or cup holder size specs . from the absolutely most exotic and expensive supercars to the new hard-top mx-5 , it just sticks to real sports cars . seems simple , right ? yet no one else gets it quite as right
0	this magazine used to be very thorough , and it used to be very good at providing me with tons of deals and tips that i never would have found on my own . it was great , and very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed the look of it and now there 's a lot less text . it 's much more a style magazine now , and that 's not what i want in a travel magazine that i have bought to tell me about money saving ! worse , except for the 40 best vacation bargains , which are still okay , most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest i do expensive things . since when is a $ 225 a night hotel considered budget ? ? the headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky . it 's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be ! i noticed that arthur frommer is n't editing it anymore which maybe is why -- bring him back ! my search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
0	i subscribed to this magazine for a year and found it a waste of money . every issue has a girl in a bikini on the front ( ca n't a woman look sexy in anything but ? ) and every issue claims to have `` the best ever exercise for ... . '' ok..what about the last 10 issues that claimed to have the same thing..those exercises are no longer `` best ever ? '' i did n't like the fashion sections , and i also do n't like how there really are n't any articles . when i subscribe to a magazine i 'd like to be able to read it , not just look at pictures . the only thing i liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive ... are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken ?
0	i ordered the magazine `` all in '' on october 10 , 2006 for my boyfriend for a christmas present it is now jan. 15 , 2007 and we still have n't received the magazine . my checking account was charged for these magazines the very day i purchased the magazines so ... ... ..i payed for something 3 months ago and still have n't received them . i dout that i will purchase anything else from amazon.com on line penny stephen
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift . not only was there no gift card sent , but the company sent the magazine to me instead of gift recipient . it took about 20 minutes on the phone with the subscription company to fix the problem and not once was there any mention of an apology for the inconvenience . the biggest disappointment was not having a gift on time !
1	inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity . with inc. , you get timely advice on taxes , marketing , financing , and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day . probably the strongest point of inc. is the way it presents important information to readers . the authors of this magazine get directly to the point . they do n't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact . even when the news is bad , like with regulations , taxation , etc. , inc. lets you have it in a direct manner . this is good , because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts . inc. writers are direct , and i respect them for that . if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine , i can think of only two : the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that , while nice to read about , present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners . inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth . this is fine , but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground . and , every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich . again , this is ok , but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic . still , inc. is a very good publication for small business owners . it provides some good , timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns . the price to subscribe is low , too , making inc. magazine a must for owners of small , growing companies .
0	please see tj-mccarthy 's review elsewhere here ; he is , to borrow a phrase from across the pond , spot-on in his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription to pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor , jim louderback , has dropped the old tagline on the front cover , `` an independent guide to technology '' . i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is , in fact , just a marketing vehicle for various products . if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing , stay away from this publication
1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution , thomas jefferson once wrote : `` i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's , and in that chiefly the advertisements , for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper . '' [ letter to nathaniel macon , january 12 , 1819 ] the nation is not a newspaper . rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv does n't dare to . those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation `` left wing , '' `` liberal , '' `` radical , '' etc. , etc . plato had written 2,300 years ago his allegory of the cave : `` behold ! human beings living in an underground den , which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den ; here they have been from their childhood , and have their legs and necks chained so that they can not move , and can only see before them , being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads . '' plato 's `` punchline '' was `` ... and if he is compelled to look straight at the light , will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see , and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him ? '' and so , dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans can not stand to look into directly . it is much less painful for them simply to say : `` ... the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation . '' for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation . it prints the patriotic , incisive truth .
1	i was so happy to pick up meridian . it 's a great mix of fiction and poetry and i could n't put it down until i finished it

0	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands . what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else ? i will never order a magazine from amazon again , i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead
1	this magazine is a must have for professional poets

1	i love entertainment weekly . this is a magazine that has everything current ... outline of plot , reviews for movies , music , tv , dvds , books . it keeps you current . it is the one magazine that i go through from cover to cover
0	psychology today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman , but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements . i give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout , and a second star for hiring writers that do n't insult the reader 's intelligence by abusing alliteration ( unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults ) . however , the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people . i have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect , rather than simply a personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )
1	this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed ' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could . this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market , in my opinion , because it has excellent production values , i.e . luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions . as a bonus , the writing is superior and highly imaginative . an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets ' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched . i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band . in addition , this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the usa as they are in uk ; often these are bands that we might want to know better . the reviews section is always great , and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g . 'best r & amp ; b albums from the 1970 's , in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists . this magazine will have you finding , buying and liking albums by bands you 've never heard of , and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price
0	i 've been a people subscriber for 2 years now i quite agree with the majority of reviewers ... same celebrities , different week . if it is n't tomkat/kitten , it 's branjelina or benifer 2 . oh , and we can not forget `` mrs. oops , i did it again '' spears-federline . very little on real people/human interest stories anymore , very little ... as for the actual magazine , it seems i 've become , through no choice of my own , one of people 's quality control employees . after subscribing , i informed customer service of my allergy to their scented inserts . i was told a note would be made to my account and i would no longer receive inserts in my magazine . here is where my job of qc employee came in , with my having to remove these inserts several times the first year , then again the second year in which i made another call to customer service . they apologized . stated there was a note on my account regarding my request then they offered to extend my subscription for two more weeks . next problem and part of my `` new '' job requirements ... reassembling my magazine . i received at least 4 or 5 issues of people put together either backwards , upside down or with half of the magazine in the front the other half flipped over in back . in order to read and enjoy these issues , i had to remove the staples , try and rearrange the pages then line the pages up by the staple holes to reinsert the staples . again i called customer service to complain . again they apologized then offered to extend my subscription another 2 weeks . i 've since written to cancel my subscription . i 've not heard a word back from people inc. , regarding this . we 'll see how it turns out
0	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70 % or more . plus , articles ( less than 15 articles in every issue ) in the magazines are not very useful . i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers . now i realize i made a mistake .
1	i 've been a faithful subscriber to `` america 's civil war '' since 1993 , and i 'd say that it 's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence . i read each issue cover-to-cover , even the letters to the editor . long after i first started studying the civil war almost 15 years ago , i 'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like `` civil war times illustrated '' ( which is also great ) . in each issue of `` america 's civil war '' you can find a variety of articles in the following categories : personality ( which focuses on a specific soldier of officer ) , eyewitness to war ( great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians ) , men and materiel ( weapons and equipment ) , reviews , commands ( focuses on individual units ) , preservation ( of artifacts and historic sites ) , and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics , from battles and leaders to politics and slavery . although i wish more would be written about the neglected western theater , i feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well . i love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles . and , `` america 's civil war '' is all about pleasing the readers . back in 1997 i mailed in a questionnaire from `` america 's civil war '' after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous irish brigade . a few months later a new article on the irish brigade ( by the very same author ) appeared in their magazine and i was very impressed by this . bottom line : if you are a civil war buff this magazine is just what you need
1	i have been very pleased with family handyman since receiving my first copy . the featured articles are particularly well done . i especially like how each project they present is well photographed and labeled . if you want a monthly installment of ideas and guidance that will really help you learn and execute some great home improvement projects give family handyman a try
1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit , it is only as good as the tools you use . this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods . there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions . you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material .
1	to the defunct and much missed armchair detective magazine . comparisons aside , strand is the best of a large group that range from glossy to fanzines newsletters covering the mystery genre . very enjoyable ! ! and do n't sell some of them short either ! john row in1ea
1	i have not yet received my issue of creating keepsakes . i have viewed previous issues at stores and have enjoyed all the creative ideas and layouts .
1	muse is one of my all-time favorite magazines . i 'm 15 ( which is above the recommended age ) and i still enjoy it . one of my favorite activities is learning and my other favorite is reading . with muse i can do both at once . what more could i ask ? i do n't know what that midwest educator is on , but i recommend you stay away from it , kids . it ca n't be good for you if it turns you against muse
0	i trashed the issue when i saw the shot of trashy paris hilton . there is enough nudity already in your publication and seeing that sad piece of work ( her ) on the cover just turned me off completely . sorry you thought her 'cover worthy ' . probably missed some fine articles . sincerely : deane everett
1	`` discipleship journal '' does what many other christian magazines do not do . it provides instruction , and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ-focused faith . while others may talk about christianity , dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture . this is n't an evangelistic magazine , like `` decision , '' or an encouraging magazine , per se , like `` moody . '' it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god 's word says . it is not for the passive pew sitter . this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays . there is nothing watered-down here . it is published by navpress , who , like their counterparts , the college ministry navigators , know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian . whether it is a discussion about satan 's favorite lies , how to study a particular book of the bible , or an explanation of what prayer is an is not , dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our lord and his ways . this is a great tool for two or three people to use together . even a small group ... to go through the articles , week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life . i 've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week 's class . i fully recommend `` discipleship journal . '' expect your faith to grow . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution , thomas jefferson once wrote : `` i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's , and in that chiefly the advertisements , for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper . '' [ letter to nathaniel macon , january 12 , 1819 ] the nation is not a newspaper . rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv does n't dare to . those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation `` left wing , '' `` liberal , '' `` radical , '' etc. , etc . plato had written 2,300 years ago his allegory of the cave : `` behold ! human beings living in an underground den , which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den ; here they have been from their childhood , and have their legs and necks chained so that they can not move , and can only see before them , being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads . '' plato 's `` punchline '' was `` ... and if he is compelled to look straight at the light , will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see , and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him ? '' and so , dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans can not stand to look into directly . it is much less painful for them simply to say : `` ... the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation . '' for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation . it prints the patriotic , incisive truth .
1	i personally have always enjoyed reading time magazine long before i became politically aware . i started reading this magazine since i was in my adolescence.do i think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is ? i do n't know and i do n't care . i do n't read it from a particular point of view . some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but i do n't take it personally . one of the best articles i have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs . i thought that was quite thought provoking . i did n't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list . katie couric ? ! c'mon . that woman is to hard journalism as paris hilton is to music . i wo n't even get into rachel ray . if people think time magazine is too liberal , then go read the national review . i do n't see time as hard journalism . half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces .
1	this is one of my favorite magazines , and the only magazine subscription i 've ever given as a gift . my list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate . i 've gifted the floss to my 73-year-old retired grandma , my 23-year-old writer sister , my 40-year-old trivia buff co-worker , and my 15-year-old high school sophomore cousin . you might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my christmas list , and you 're probably right . but there 's something in mental floss for everybody . i pick up a half-dozen conversational nuggets each month . i probably subscribe to 10 mags , and i 'd say this is the one i actually read every month . great stuff . my highest recommendation .
0	great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it 's free - but not worth your money to own . i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here . oh , once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine , but not consistently . the home section is n't that inspirational either . go for it if it 's free , but if it 's not , do n't buy it
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine . this is the size of a reader 's digest , but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine . i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover . they share reasonable and attainable goals , and suggestions for us normal people . the magazine seems to cover a wide age group , with information that is good for both young and old . they do offer recipes , workout suggestions , and much more . the magazine takes little time to read , and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy . i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase
1	five `` big apple '' stars ! ! new york magazine is a mind trip to new york city that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world . but it 'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine . and it covers everything : from a throughly researched , interesting , and eye-catching cover article , to departments that cover movies , the latest broadway play reviews , the night clubs , and a restaurant and club section 'that goes on and on ' . i can literally plan forays into the 'big apple ' using this magazine , from the latest trendy hotel , the latest 'unique ' meal in an established or a new reataurant , the newest on or off broadway play , art movie houses showing great independent movies that you probably wo n't find anywhere else in the us outside of los angeles , what artist is appearing at what jazz or rock club and the times of the shows , `` cover '' or `` no cover '' , etc , etc , etc . and yes , tons of glitzy ads . it 's just a `` new york state of mind '' in a magazine that you can use to plan a physical trip or just mentally take the trip . and it will keep you up to date on the current issues in the city . new york magazine sets the standard for all of those other city and state magazines . i love new york city and i love new york magazine . five big stars !
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription . i have waited over 4 months since i first paid . i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine . that was 4 weeks ago . if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else . it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here
1	i like getting good stuf in the mail and one day i received this mag from my grandma and i really enjoyed it , seeing as i had just enter hi skool and there we tons of things i wasnt real sure on ... however my mom discontinued it , saying i was too young for it ... many reviewers say this , so i will say what many of them fail to specify : this magazine is geared more for girls who have entered the high-school , teenager period , and deals alot with makeup and boys , a bit of fashion , and keeping close to your friends . i will take a stab at saying its mostly for teens , if not for the younger ones , ages 15 and up ... but realy , dating and makeup are things a girls will decide on when shes ready ... i have neither dated , nor wore makeup , and im an older girl , and the only reason i am more interested in boys and trying to put on eyeshadow is age-curiousity ... the mag has not affected me in any way ... except provide a few hours worth of reading and quiz-taking , plus help on everyday worries ( ie , body , social probs , and so forth ) great mag if you know you have a mature daughter who doesnt change overnite to please people at skool ... age isnt the real big issue if u are maturer ( 15 and up , or have just matured 5x faster than most girls ur age ) and want a mag that is more real life than just made up stories ( they have a fiction section ) , more diverse girls ( all kinds of body types and ethnicities ) , and all around more mature theme , pick up seventeen ... its a great mag , but parents beware ... is talks about sex and has real life stories that can be very disturbing ... just to warn u ... my rents didnt realy like it , but if ur well rounded and have good morals , u realy need not worry ... see y
1	i am not a big magazine reader -- never have been , never really had time to ! however , a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read ... after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own ! this magazine covers everything ! it 's got tips for life , cooking , decorating , organzing , and getting the best deal for your money . a lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas , for instance , are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life . for example : the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler . the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me ... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great ! they do n't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do , and when they do it 's in an article where they had comparisons done ... always a recommendation , and usually more than one . the important thing here is they do n't say `` buy this product '' they say `` buy products that have such and such feature , make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair , and oh here 's an example of what we 're talking about . '' they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme . so , in conclusion , if you 're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life ... this is a great magazine . the information is helpful , applicable to normal everyday life ... and it 's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers
1	overall , this is the best gaming magazine i have read . it covers all consoles , gives sensible ( and funny ) reviews , and previews the hottest upcomming games . most games are reviewed by two people , adding to the accuracy of the score . it has a rating of 1-10 , 10 being the best , a rating which precious few games recieve . the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games . some of them are one page long , some ten . they all include pictures , and most have an estimated release date . also , there is a section on news in the game industry . ususlly near the beginning of the magazine , they include news on developers , consoles , and the big names in the industry . all in all , this is a great magazine , and well worth your money , because each issue is well over 100 pages
0	i got this magazine as a gift , starting a few months back . i really ca n't say i 'm impressed . admittedly , i 'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything , they 're just fairly rare . if you want to read a well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this is n't it
0	this magazine used to be very thorough , and it used to be very good at providing me with tons of deals and tips that i never would have found on my own . it was great , and very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed the look of it and now there 's a lot less text . it 's much more a style magazine now , and that 's not what i want in a travel magazine that i have bought to tell me about money saving ! worse , except for the 40 best vacation bargains , which are still okay , most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest i do expensive things . since when is a $ 225 a night hotel considered budget ? ? the headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky . it 's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be ! i noticed that arthur frommer is n't editing it anymore which maybe is why -- bring him back ! my search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living , i was actually appalled by this magazine . it is ostensibly health conscious , but upon closer examination it ignores important health information . for example , in one issue , it had a whole article about diabetes and how , thanks to the miracles of science , diabetics can now eat sugary foods . it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which . a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer , and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet . i was disappointed with the magazine
1	i love this magazine great travel ideas , and fun to read even if you never make the trip ! a recent issue on the yucatan really helped make our vacation there so much more interesting . we visted ruin sites we would have never seen other wise . this magazine and `` tourist in the yucatan '' ( thriller/adventure ) really made my vacation special
0	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year-old grandson . for some reason ziff-davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine . ( dec 27 , 2005 , p 122 if you want to check it out ) . previous issues had partial page ads selling `` sex pheremones '' which i could almost overlook , but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line .
1	i was a loyal reader for many years , and i 've always been very impressed by their insightful , deep investigations into various scandals and national political events . they _always_ knew more than the newspapers . they 've been just excellent , very well-written , and i always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the 6th level of abstraction , so to speak . their pursuit of the objective truth , whether their target has been bush or the dnc , has earned my respect . the new republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre-digested pablum . my sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws , news sources have become air-tight and we 've been getting our news from company pr flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas . in this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold . middle-brow types read time , but the writers at time and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the new republic . the magazine has been vastly more influential than it 's 100k+ circulation # 's would imply . but..the new republic was _for_ the war in iraq , despite their natural antipathy towards bush , which i share . i have n't read them lately - i 'm sure they 're appalled at how things have gone over there . the magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the left , but here i feel like they 've let loose their inner hawks given bush the benefit of the doubt ( always the _wrong_ decision ) .. so what does that make them..quasi-neocons ? utopians ? dupes ? they 're often much too closely focused on israel , and this also may have clouded their thinking ..along with colin powell 's great song-and-dance at the u.n. last year . i felt i needed to try something new . lately i 've been reading the new yorker reason ( it 's right-of-center doppelganger ) some other magazines , but i still think the new republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile . definately - you should buy an issue on the news stand try it out
0	i am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material , 'wired ' is even too tedious to fill that need . its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled national geographics of questionable scientific value . on the other hand the articles , for example in the latest issue , 'are higher gas prices good for us ' ( paraphrase of title ) offer little information and if i had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced operation independance . the intention at the time was to free the u.s. from dependance on foriegn oil . oh we of short memory , condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters ! of interest may be the dumb means by which i obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines , playstation magazine - now x box magazine , the completely amoral men 's health , garden club , cooking . i simply check the highest income level on every form i fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application . typical of something recieved for nothing wired is not a publication for which i would recommend laying out any money or time . including bathroom time .
0	this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit . it 's filled with many success stories . but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success . it 's also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , and every other ad is about franchising . i have a one year subscription and at this point i 'm bored . i 'll keep the subscription , but it 's highly unlikely that i will renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur.com . you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine , and will prove to be a great wealth of information
0	look at the price of this magazine ! over $ 30 for 6 magazines ! i once read one of these magazines at the library and i hated it ! there were no articles about celebrities , tv , music , or beauty . there were some good advice questions in this , but it did n't give any advice for them ! it said , `` find the answers to these questions in the next issue of new moon . '' also , in the mail bag , someone wrote , `` why did n't you put martin luther king day on your calendar ? '' they wrote back , `` sorry , this magazine is only about girls and women . '' this magazine is really anti-male and disses girls that act like normal teenagers . if you want to get a good magazine , try girls life for almost half the price that new moon is
0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer . they might as well call this the robb report . they only test highend cars and the `` best '' ones are the ones that go 0-60mph the quickest , not ride nice or get good mpg
1	i was on vacation in miami last december and picked-up a copy of this magazine-bw.it is the best photographic magazine i have ever seen or read.it is the best tribute to black and white photography as an art form . the prinitng quality is equally as superb and highly compliments the new technology in printing.it gives new meaning to the words photo finish . unfortunately the magazine is only avaliable in the united states so i have had to subscribe using my son 's address in miami . it has inspired me to further improve my work as an artist , photographer , who considers black and white photography as the only true art form and dismisses digital photography as not being photography . norris hall , belmopan , belize , central america
0	( i sent the following letter to their customer service last week ) after about 15 years of getting your magazine , i have decided not to renew my subscription . it is a shame that your once great publication has become such a joke . after receiving your november issue , and spending 10 minutes removing all the inserts and gimmick ads so i could actually read it , i found no substance . instead there is a fashion section ( yikes ) , a `hot list ' with young barely dressed men and women ( hey i 'm not against a little sex and skin , but i 'll subscribe to vogue or maxim for that ) , an article about larry david 's wife that might as well have come from people magazine , an aussie travelogue that i am convinced their tourist board paid for , all sandwiched in between so many ads for monster suvs and other crap that you need a compass and a map just to keep up with where the articles worth reading continue from one page to the next . what happened to the great writers like krakauer ? what happened to having any environmental conscience ? where are the stories of adventure that are real and make you want to go there ? maybe i am just getting older than your current demographic . i have n't lost my sense of adventure , which is why i live in durango co and spend a lot of time outdoors . i used to look to your magazine for inspiration . now i half expect the cover to tout stories on `killer abs ' . you 've become the clear channel of the outdoor magazine world . get real again and i may come back
0	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions . today is october 12th and i 've never received us news . i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received . when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount . if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight . also , the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess .
1	harper 's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine , second only to instyle . it is great and packed with great fashion . it actually does have some good articles too that i thoroughly enjoy reading . ( the articles are much better than the ones in elle . ) if you can only get one sub , get instyle . if you can get two , get instyle and harper 's bazaar . it is well-worth the money
1	the smartest , best-informed , and most , well , entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture . i read it cover to cove
1	i highly recommend highlights for children . it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way . watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles , hidden pictures , games , and fun and entertaining stories . cynthia marie rizzo , author of julie and the unicorn
0	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover . unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising . as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual `` content '' in about an hour . the rest is advertising and bs . this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago . just let it die already like it 's supposed to
1	this is an excellent magazine . my young son has been recieving this magazine and has enjoyed it every month . it provides factual information in an interesting format . it has lovely pictures . there are stories , crafts and games that all teach about one main theme with the over lapping idea being all about nature . it is educational and yet it is not boring or overwhelming wtih facts and figures . it is great for the age 7-10 crowd .
1	no doubt , wired is one of the best tech magazines in print , but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse . i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november . i had to call and cancel my subscription . i now subscribe directly
1	it 's true that entrepreneur mag is loaded with ads -- but those ads can be interesting in themselves . i always find it fascinating to see what ads pop and what ads are junk -- and it 's easy to see the difference . this is an opportunity to develop your own advertising strategy ! as for the content , there is certainly room for improvement . i personally enjoy the entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they were longer . i would like to see more meat here . having been in business for several years now , i find the most value in this magazine comes from the front section where they list interesting tips , new products , and survey results . not a month goes by that i do n't bookmark a page so i can follow up on a new product or check out a website mentioned in a short piece . for that alone , the low subscription price is worth the investment . there is a lot of information on franchising , which is great for those interested in this business model . though this is not my personal cup of tea , i still find it interesting to read the lists of franchises and notice the trends in popularity . who knew there were so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one of the best general magazines available for entrepreneurs . not every topic can appeal to every reader since we all run different kinds of businesses and seek different information . if you 're looking for something more specific to your industry , a trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you can keep an eye on the climate of the small biz world .
1	this magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that 's no small feat . i love how lucky shows how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd . if that 's all i had interest in , then i could 've simply bought the lucky shopping guide book . but their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers , hair , makeup , home decor , and the `` how i 'm wired '' sections keep me coming back to the magazine . plus the lucky breaks are awesome . my only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items . what lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that i can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like h , target , etc . it 's so worth the $ 12/year , and i look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox
0	articles were n't anything new . mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads . better info and exercises in oxygen and women 's m
1	this is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures . this particular magazine is about 60 % color pictures . at least the issues i 've bought were . this is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut . a majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above . this is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait . since this magazine is pictures of celebrities you can also use it to keep track of their hairstyle changes
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product . it 's to give a good review until it arrives
1	my wife brought a copy of strand home yesterday . the editorial and production quality look excellent . the personality interview , scholarly article and the short stories are very good . i plan to subscribe
1	most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere . having lived in washington , i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado , but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all ca n't live in the pacific northwest . i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice , but i do wish bh would take that into consideration . otherwise , i love this magazine . i used to get several magazines , but this was always my favorite . it is chock full of ideas that we can really use . and i love the photography . what sets bh apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses . slippers on the floor , newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too . they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot . it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable . i would say get this magazine right away . i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing .
0	disney , just about the worst company on earth , has many lines of magazines . this is just used to suck even more money , even though they already have so much money that they 're kids drown to death in money . then disney goes on to cancel dave the barbarian and teacher 's pet , the only good disney shows
1	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom . a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks . however , even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside , icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials . top-notch magazine and highly recommended . just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this , as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines , here in the states
0	let me first say i am one of martha stewart 's biggest fans ! i have enjoyed msl magazine for years and loved the format of the `` old '' show ( the new one is taking awhile to get used to ) . i jumped at body and soul when it first came out , but have been repeatedly disappointed in the obvious exclusion of anything `` male '' in the articles . not to mention , the articles on relationships and love have never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , and just plain stupid from a marketing standpoint . why exclude men and gay people ? i have also noticed there are no ads from advertisers marketing to men either . most if not all of the articles are nothing more than `` new age '' pablum , either `` borrowed '' or stolen from much better magazines such as alternative medicine . do n't waste your time or money on this one . this is n't even good enough to line my cat 's litter box
1	i have been a subscriber to family fun for 4+ years and i have always enjoyed the magazine . i do n't remember ever being disappointed in an issue . i usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles ideas i want to keep on file for future reference . in most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most . with family fun i always end up with a huge stack of ideas that i want to hang on to . what is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that i actually use and apply in our everyday lives . practical , useful and fun are all words i would use to describe this publication . my favorite features include : `` my great idea '' - submitted by readers `` family almanac '' - seasonal activities and resources and the travel ideas . we have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned . some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by disney . i 'm not sure why that is such a problem , but i do realize some people do n't like disney . the truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway . at least the disney company has helped family fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine . i do n't find that disney is overly promoted ( a rarity in the world of disney i know ! ) in this magazine . there are plenty of reviews and references to very non-disney products such as the harry potter series , shrek movies , and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a disney enterprise . this magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating
0	this magazine shows the negative side of black men . i find the magazine an embarrasement to the african-american community . it seems out of all the races of men in the world , black men seem to want to display their lack of self control , their love of fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which in no way helps create wealth in our communities . and i am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover . until , black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped , they will always be stopped by the police , be passed over for employment , and looked down upon . i wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community , showing respect and love for their women , and showing that everything is not hip hip !
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive , but it 's mostly advertising . very disappointing . it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it ( which is why it got 2 stars from me ) , but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription
0	on the whole , bicycling is a huge disappointment . i agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good , but i do n't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- i read those in the newstand . further , as i will mention below , once and a while there is a real gem of an article . in the meantime , almost everything else they do is poor . the entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros , training obsessively and fighting with that last 1 % of body fat . the reality is , what bicycling 's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages , they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $ 115,000 . so it 's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride , it 's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride . the result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $ 3000+ bikes ( and , as one reviewer said , the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $ 1500 . wait , $ 1500 is *not* chump change ? ! ? ! ) , advanced training and eating techniques , etc. , as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides , touring , commuting ( gasp ! ) , etc . even it 's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the san fran gp , one of the three most important races in the us , was 6 pages of photos , 4 of which were of people watching the race , not the racing itself . for me , though , the worst part is its hypocrisy . in a recent issue , there was a truly excellent article on what the author called `` invisible riders '' -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday . yet : the author mentioned several times ( albeit with embarrassment ) that he was riding a seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $ 100 bikes ; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday , a movement which riders like bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize ( maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting ) ; and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $ 3500- $ 7000 . really , really sad . one star for `` invisible riders '' and the like , and that 's it
1	for $ 10 a year , at least i can look at a magazine that is n't dominated by spongebrand squarepants or dora the commercialized explorer and that realizes not every parent thinks the disney princess pastel hegemony is the only way to go for a nursery . will i pay $ 200 for a sweater ? very doubtful , but if i did it would be something i could pass down as an heirloom . true , i may spend more per item on my daughter 's clothes and toys than most , but i also limit the number of things she does receive . i 'd rather spend $ 100 on one unique toy i found in cookie than give her twenty pieces of plastic at $ 5 a pop from some toy megapolis . cookie covers quality over quantity , style over branding , modern over mainstream and for that i 'm grateful
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful , with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships , i found that customer service was very dissapointing . i missed an issue back in october , and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed . it is now march , and i still have n't received my replacement . just a heads up !
0	do not ! ! order from this website ! i purchased a subscription for oxygen magazine on jan. 30 , 2006 , and i still have not received the first issue . i am very dissapointed , to say the least !
1	men 's health is one of the most popular men 's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man . you simply have to know about fitness , dieting , supplements , fashion , gadgets , etc . the annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks . one of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities . the tips are definitely useful and yet i highly recommend in addition the bestseller `` scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex '' for the latest secrets in this area . another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy , lean and fit . there are weight loss tips , advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast . this is important part of keeping sharp appearance . overall , i can reasonably say that you will learn a lot , have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover .
0	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies . filled with poorly-written articles . i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine . it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , and no i 'm not talking about the advertisements , but the actual articles themselves . the magazine is not a news magazine , it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in . if you like paying for ads , go for it
1	there 's a lot to like about lenswork - the selection of images , the quality of the printing , bill jay 's `` end notes '' - but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment . brooks jensen ( the editor/publisher ) does n't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph , or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it . all that matters is the image . and after you 've finished looking at the images , you 'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue , too . highly recommended
0	time magazine named george bush as person of the year , despite the economic , international and ecological damage he has done and will continue to do over the next four years . speak and be heard . cancel your subscription .
1	i love this magazine ! it has up to the minute , need to know celeb news . honestly most of the time what they say in these `` tabloid '' magazines turns out to be true- jessica simpson split , and brad and angelina , jen and vince , just to name a few ... .also there 's movie/dvd/music reviews , makeup and fashion tips , and the clothes they have in there are affordable so you can dress like your favorite celeb . i look forward to each week getting this magazine
0	this magazine was given to us as a gift subscription when our son was born , but both my wife and i quickly tired of it . the previous review that pointed out their lack of scientific research in a good bulk of their advice and their tendency to misquote and distort studies is just plain irresponsible . the magazine seems to be firmly stuck in a fantasy 'pc ' world of lofty goals and ideals for your children that have very little real world application . articles about disciplining your children that read along the lines of 'if your 2 year old hits his brothe rin the face with a soccer ball , look him straight in the face , make eye contact and tell him that it is not nice to hit ' . thanks for that pearl of wisdom . anyone with a 2 year old can atest to the futility of reasoning with them . never would parents magazine advocate something that might actually work like say taking all of his toys away and marching his butt to the corner where he gets to stand for say 9 years or until he is adopted by the neighbors : ) seriously , the magazine writes for a fantasy land scenario where june and ward are the parents and the kids act like the munchkins on a disney tv movie . if you happen to be the cleavers , go for it..
0	i used to enjoyed discover , but the past several months of their radicals changes , got me to think a real dumbing down.once in awhile , they would put together a good article - but not constantly.how can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.there are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.discover 's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky and telescope , science news havent fallen down.i am not renewing my subscription unless discover 'rediscovers ' itself.how dumb americans are !
0	when i first heard there was an american version of l'uomo vouge i was really excited . i thought `` finally an american men 's fashion magazine that 'll be edgy , risky , creative original ! '' i could n't have been more wrong . this magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster men 's magazines gq , esquire details . european men 's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography , bold reporting beautiful advertising . you wo n't find any of this in men 's vouge . the editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of american readers . if i could i 'd give this magazine a negative 5
1	great conservative political journalism . would 've liked to read it when william buckley was editor
0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews . unlike the description included on the amazon website , the subsription does not include the cd-rom , which costs an additional $ 1/issue . and , if you want to purchase the cd-roms for past issues , they cost $ 4/disk . sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain . buyer beware
0	i ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue , but unfortunately over the course of the year i only received a total of three issues ! the magazine is great , but i wonder what the problem is . i have no received much help from amazon or modern bride . guess i learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore .
1	i 've been subscribing to plusa since 1984 , the same year i started powerlifting . it contains a wealth of information for the beginner to the elite lifter . interesting strength articles , interviews with the champions of the sport , results from meets , and the list of upcoming contests . it also contains all the different powerlifting vendors for your equipment needs . its a must to have this magazine for anyone into or starting out with powerlifting . its the original mag
0	i am also a longtime subscriber , and i am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine . i have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances , if you will ( i would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am a current subscriber , and was quite suprised by discover 's new look ( to all reading this review on amazon.com : amazon.com does not display the updated version of what discover currently looks like ) . i did n't quite care for it , but as long as the material stayed the same i was going to be allright with it . unfortunately , the articles in discover have degenerated into `` top 20 things you did n't know about ... '' lists , piles of trivia , some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news . sure , reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous . is it appropriate for what discover stood for or what i have expected from this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there is an intelligent article . the cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the old discover . i really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox . i 've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition i possibly could because i truly did enjoy reading them , and still do . maybe this new discover is for a `` new generation '' or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers , but i think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse . i think the ordinary person , the `` lay man '' if you will , would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new , interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community . i remember the string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.it was very exciting , and most importantly it [ i ] got me interested in the science [ /i ] . i doubt i will ever see anything that good from discover magazine again . i 'd really hate to give up on this magazine : all i ask is for the old discover back .
0	i hate this magazine . i subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews , and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat ... way too exotic . if you like good ol ' american fare , do n't buy this one
1	science matters . you already know that . you want to stay on top of what 's happening in medicine , space research , earth studies , and more . that 's because you know things like aids , earthquakes , and changing weather patterns all have huge significance to human needs and social policy . but you do n't have the time or the specialized knowledge to plow through piles of academic journals every week , hunting the nuggets that mean the most and translating them into the language of normal , educated reader . you want science news . it 's brief and readable , so you do n't have to dedicate half your week to keeping up with what really matters . it 's weekly , which matters in a world where month-old news is old news . and it 's written so that any concerned citizen can understand the science and the issues . the editors do n't write down to the readers , but they do n't assume specialized education either . intelligent high-schoolers or precocious tween-agers can grasp the important parts of each story , but specialists ( including one university prof i know ) use it to keep up with news outside of their research areas . try a few issues at your local library - you 'll probably find that you 'll want your own . //wiredweir
1	i have read this mag thru and thru , and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop . it is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content , that i have ever seen . to be totally honest , i would much rather read and browse this any day over `` print '' magazine . this is almost like a graphic design book , that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on . i found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since ... also for those of you who can read/write japanese , german , and english you can have your pick while reading..
0	i have to agree with those who did n't care for it . the only thing i liked was one article written by a dad who was skateboarding with his son . it was witty , insightful and inspirational . the rest of the mag just seemed totally irrelevent to my life . it is aimed at people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . does anyone do that ? i do n't want my kids to be that concerned with clothes and money . the few issues i read made me mad and depressed . i 've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so regarding this lame magazine . give me break with that $ 400 cashmere hoodie for my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts and that is what matters . he is not a reflection of my style , he is a reflection of his own . get over yourselves
1	no doubt , wired is one of the best tech magazines in print , but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse . i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november . i had to call and cancel my subscription . i now subscribe directly
1	sports illustrated is a great magazine , the premier magazine for sports . the writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article . to make this short , i highly recommend this a subscription for any sports fan -- it 's a great gift for a husband , boyfriend , or just any sports fan
1	my husband and i started with a free subscription to this magazine and fell in love with it . we both read it from cover to cover
1	after reading a few of the other reviews , i am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things . this is a conservative magazine ! ! liberals , open at your own risk ! you just might encounter a differing view point than you own ! goodness . the articles are informative , indepth , humorous , and thoughtful . it 's a good read .
1	excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare , in just 30 minutes . no need to be out of ideas for any party or get together , just open the book to any page , and you 're set and ready to go , or should i say cook !
1	we subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old . our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well . we all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail . i enjoy flipping through it myself . you 're never to old to learn fun facts about nature ! ! a perfect gift
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue
0	psychology today is just another glamour/cosmo/people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology . this magazine used to be well-written and had more scientific data . however , since the appointment of the new editor , headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over . if you are interested in scientific data and research , this is not the magazine for you . i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all
0	i have received this magazine from it 's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies , however , the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service . i have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right . i have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer . if you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them
0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine . but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands ( with a big , heavy thud ) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing . it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders , self-regarding movie celebs , and those people who 'd like to be part of that world . even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject , the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent . it 'd be more accurate simply to cut `` fair '' out of the title
1	in touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $ 1.99 . it is very similar to star and us weekly . they offer fodder on the hollywood flavor of the moment , so expect lots of stories about julia roberts , britney spears , brad pitt , jenifer aniston , j.lo and the usual suspects . it is very worth the newstand price . they rarely , if ever have human interest stories , most of the stories are all about celebrities , style , make-up , or fashion . they also have contests some times . a lot of times i notice they run the same stories and pictures as us weekly so if i had to choose between in touch and us weekly 1 year subscription is less i would choose us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that in touch . also , some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old , i often think they end up filling space close to print time . it 's an okay magazine an worth the cover price
0	i was gon na make a point , but fabz made it for me i was gon na say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles and yayo 's hit singles werent really hits his songs were on the radio tv for probably about a month or two if thats what you call a hit then you crazy the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 songs on the cd a couple of good songs dont make it good cd you want to see what other people think of the yayo album read the reviews for it and jeezy please he always been garbag
0	i can not review this item because a month later , i still have not received the first issue of my subscription . sorry frank caldero
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos . if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue . however , as other reviews have indicated , the articles are quite lacking . they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting . so , you get vogue for the pictures . if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine , if you want something to read get something else
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription . i have waited over 4 months since i first paid . i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine . that was 4 weeks ago . if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else . it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here
0	there are very few serious articles in this magazine -- just tons of tidbits ( stats/facts/tips ) . by the time you get to the end it 's difficult to recall anything from the magazine ; it 's that shallow . occasionally there 's a good recipe , but that 's about it
1	this science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person . articles are good , not overly technical in depth . at times it gets in its doldrums of articles , but generally it holds it own . you do n't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same . but it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot . it does at times takes some thought of getting used to . their 'special topic issues ' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website . at least the layperson can be science informed . the title of the magazine says it all
1	very interesting with nice pictures . gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world
1	old mac usr , new mac usr , matters not . there is something in this magazine for everyone . and , icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too .
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants . there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all . if you consider yourself a 'foodie ' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine , then this magazine might be for you . if , however , you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .
1	i love this magazine ! it tells you about every new game that comes out brand new
0	i was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor 's office . i love instyle , lucky and other shopping mags , but the tone of this is mean and snooty . there are too many ads , and very little content . there 's a q section about sex after baby that 's just mean , threatening that if you do n't jump back in , `` one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing ... '' way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby . yuck .
0	i subscribed to this magazine in august and just received the september issue now ! budget travel 's customer service is terrible , i 've complained several times but am still missing the august , october and november issues , have asked for a refund but have yet to have my account credited
0	i 'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated . sure it 's an o.k . magazine , if you like immersing yourself in hype , marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language . admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn . i just can not read any of the articles . chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme ' language . i do n't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary ' or 'amazing ' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers . they ceaselessly use vapid 'technical ' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech , but is nothing more than marketing spew . the tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising . if there 's one thing that 's well thought-out about this magazine , it 's how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches , half-truths and hype . in short , this magazine is blatant industry propaganda . my first advice : do n't buy it . if you do buy it ( for the love of god ) do n't take anything between those covers seriously .
1	i love this magizine and i have read every issue . it has great fitness tips for you whole body . i would definately recomend this magizine to you
1	my husband and i both love to cook , and some of our new favorites come from this magazine . the reviews are informative , the recipes taste great ( and are not overly complicated ) , and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful . the magazine likes to pick a theme for the month ( or several ) which has a couple of benefits . 1 . you can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2 . you have several options for one basic idea . for example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics ( so you could modify the basic recipe your own way ) and then gave several variations . best i have found out there so far
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read : motortrend , car and driver , automobile mag , sport compact . i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars . car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny
1	golf digest is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications . it 's self-styled tag line -- 'the # 1 golf publication ' -- is well-earned . where other weeklies report the golfing *news* , golf digest is a monthly celebration of golf as life , or at least of the golfing life . it 's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ( 'do n't stretch your wedges ' ) , giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers . even those of us who are less than bent on links glory , the photography of this publication looks extraordinary . this aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine 's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world . no doubt about it , golf digest is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else . yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game . golf digest anchors the world of english-language golfing publications . even better , you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles
1	good housekeeping is a wholesome , clean , serious magazine . various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children , household tips , financial help , or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman . i 'm married and only in my 20s , but i still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway . i absolutely love this magazine ! i was looking for a magazine with good , long articles to read , and i found this great one . they even re-designed the look , and it 's excellent . everything is more organized , clearly separated into their respective sections , and each page is clearly marked with the section header so i 'll always know which section i 'm on . i particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies , talk to me by joy behar about relationship advice , and peggy post 's etiquette dilemmas
1	this magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men . it has everything you want , including hot babes , cars , gadgets , and sexy bikinis . it is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff , like the new watches they showed by fossil and dkny , and some excellent martini recipes , and then they turned me on to a dvd called `` new sex now '' which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies . i , for one , am hooked .
1	of the big 3 ( fortune , forbes , and businessweek ) , i like fortune the most . businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing . forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose -- -to report and analyze the business world . fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does
1	this newsletter is a great resource for dog people . the articles are well researched , detailed , and best of all , applicable . i keep them in a binder , and often refer back to earlier issues if i have a health or training concern about my dogs ( and have been known to share them with friends . ) both the positive training and the holisitic health information is great . i definitely recommend this newsletter to anyone who loves their dogs .
1	great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures . sadly it only comes 2x 's a year
1	i have been a reader of motor trend for most of my life . i am 50 years of age and since high school art/design classes there has been nothing like motor trend for past , present , and future car , truck , and other motor vehicle design like this publication . ***** j. e. hoove
0	i used to sell and fix macs since the original mac 128 , i have owned 14 macs over 21 years so i have seen it all . mac addict is ok but only because our choices are so slim . mac user was always the best and i could n't bother renewing macworld after they got nasty with my late payment after i bought it for almost 20 years . i quit buying macaddict because of all the free disks . they were full of buggy freebies and ii turned me off . to keep up with macs , read the ny times in the circuits section and david pogue 's column , web site . also . if you can afford the wall st journal , read walt mossberg for all techy things . he gives a fair review and answers any questions he can , mac pc , camera . the wash post on line has a good tech writer for mac stuff.we reallt do n't need a magazine with the web . happy mac-ing and order tiger . i just got my new ipod photo 60 gig and a 1gig shuttle which i use every day in the gym . buy applecare and apple will cover the ( probably ) 2 batteries . i have an original ipod ( 10gig in 01 ) and the battery still works and i abused it on many plane trips . it still runs and is my bedroom pod hooked up to my bose cd/radio . yeah i love toys . roger taylo
0	i thought i detected some deterioration in the quality of discover magazine in recent months , so i went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion . indeed they have . sad .
0	i got this magazine for a year and a half before i had to quit my subscription recently . i liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style , and that is why i subscribed to begin with . but i was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me . ( not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway , so that 's not a complaint ) . sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased ( telling the facts of stds and such ) , but 90 % of the articles on sex , were opinion and not fact . girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like seventeen who say that sex is good if you 're ready ( what 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an std or a baby ? ? please . ) , and that condoms are 100 % effective . they are not , but that 's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this . they need to take advice from their parents and doctors , not magazine articles . i was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .
0	nice cover pictures and headlines , but way too many ads . there 's a reason its only twelve bucks , this is an ad-sponsored mag
0	as you can tell by the title , i 'm not enamored of this magazine . i 've been playing video games since the early 80s , and have read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons for this negative review of gamepro follow in no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points is just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) the written part of the reviews are way too short , and often are written borderline incoherantly . it 's as if they hired the proverbial 1,000 monkeys to type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews on one page . screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp . 4 . ) the number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high . once when i was bored , i counted all the ads in one issue . out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads . 5 . ) their article layouts are confusing , and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color . forget about reading it if you 're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain do n't work . i suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags , such as egm and game informer . so , in closing ... if you want a good gaming magazine , just about any magazine other than gamepro would be an improvement . many great gaming magazines have come and gone , why a turd like gamepro continues is a mystery to me
0	do not buy this magazine ! for any price , it is too expensive . marie claire has harassed me repeatedly to pay for my subscription . it was paid for in advance thru amazon . i have sent them copies of my amazon receipt twice . they are reporting me to a credit agency for non-payment . avoid them , avoid them . they are scam artists and will falsely and with malice destroy your credit rating .
0	it takes too much time to receive the first book . i have n't received the first book yet
1	this magazine has been consistently good for many many years . ca n't live without i
1	this is perhaps my favorite photography magazine . the printing is fantastic as is the subject matter . i really like the fact there are no ads in it at all . so many photography mags are just an extended catalog for b or adorama that this is a breath of fresh air . the photography itself is second to none . always something interesting and fresh
1	it always seems like a holiday when my utne arrives . it has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan . nowadays , with so much of our `` news '' actually being political spin and hype , with that forced-fed feeling , it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting , tasty , thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill , banal , overly celebrity-focused junk . [ hey , i like celebrities just as much as the next guy , but i like to take a break once-in-a-while . ] utne respects your intelligence . it seems to arrive just on time , every time . the focus here is on improving one 's life and , perhaps , one 's corner of the world ( or just a corner of a room ) . sure , there is a progressive bent to the content ( it used to be dubbed `` the best of the alternative media '' ) : there 's ample pro-environment , pro-organic , pro-diversity , pro-spirituality content here . [ have they made `` progressive '' a dirty word , too ? ? ? ] i find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries . go for it . you will be amply rewarded . like entering a fresh , new world every two months . you will likely read it from cover-to-cover
0	this overpriced magazine is for the weekend warriors who would like to start a new hobby . there is nothing wrong with this , we all started somewhere . however , one can only stand for so much of new tool ratings and how to build the same old challege-less pieces of furniture . please do n't waste your money . try fine woodworking , woodworking , or even popular woodworking . you will be greatful you did , and will be on the road to becoming an expert weekend warriors
1	i 'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it was on a leap of faith that i bought natural health magazine without reading anything about it . a friend suggested it , and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before , i caved in and bought the july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off by saying that i 'm an extremely picky person . i have extremely high standards for every purchase i make , and i absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if i find a fault . now that i 've gotten that out of the way , i will mention that i was thoroughly impressed with natural health . long ago , i subscribed to new age magazine ( now known as body soul , which i do not care for ) . it was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice . i can not stand redundancy , incorrect information and excessive advertising . i found that natural health was much more long the lines of the former new age magazine , filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $ 3.95 i paid . to give you an idea of what the magazine includes , here is a small sampling of the articles i found in the july/august issue : small articles include : - `` to bee or not to bee '' , a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , and honey , stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are . - `` how can i get relief from pms ? '' experts ( including a naturopath , gynecologist and dietitian ) answer this question with excellent responses . - `` medicine cabinet : attack of the weekend warrior '' natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors . - `` clothes to pose in '' great yoga gear ! - `` medical breakthroughs '' - `` healing supplements : 8 ways to beat anxiety '' - `` fitness fix - knee savers '' longer articles include : - `` healthy appetites : savvy strategies for eating well '' delicious , healthy recipes and tips . - `` good medicine : a clean , healthy mouth '' a well-researched article on `` mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies '' . - `` five paths to peace '' five simple meditation techniques . - `` eat to beat the heat : yin foods '' more great recipes ! - `` sacred spaces '' - making your home your personal retreat . this is only a sampling ; in fact , that 's less than half of the magazine alone . some articles are fairly short , but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across . my personal favorite was the last page , `` make one change '' , where this month 's change is to `` upgrade your z 's '' . it included simple tips that i was able to implement immediately . the amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably about the same amount as you 'd find in a yoga journal , but not nearly as many as in oprah magazine ) , and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus . judging by the past reviews on natural health , it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe . let 's remember that magazines change editors frequently . i found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue , but that may not be so in future issues years from now . as for me , i want a subscription asap
1	revolver 's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are hit parader and circus . i have bought all three of these magazines several times , and revolver my final judgement is revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to . the other two i still buy occasionally , but only for wallpaper ( i cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room . ) this magazine is , in a way , like a combination of circus and blender magazines ; it combines the best aspects of both . revolver still has plenty of great pictures , but it is also much longer and much better written than circus . it is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as blender , but make sure you note that revolver only reports on one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report on every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances are , if a hard rock band ( especially a big name hard rock band ) is about to or has already released a c.d. , revolver will do a story about it . the stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them . if it 's a cover story , an interview with the band is also included ; if it 's not a cover story , the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article , anyways ( even though it 's not a formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band ( i.e . lamb of god ) . in that case , they take the reader backstage , on the tour bus , and in a concert ( with a rundown of the show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there was a sexual theme to it . there would be a picture of a `` hot babe '' in a t-shirt , and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose . in the past year or so , revolver phased that out ( probably to appeal to a broader audience ) . i sometimes miss the pictures of the `` hot babes , '' but this way there 's more room for real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex is n't a theme anymore , revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager . plus , there are usually profanities ( mainly the `` f word . '' ) so , i would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up . monthly articles : -cover story -3 or 4 other biggish stories - `` fresh blood '' column ( where a small biography is given on a band you probably have n't heard of ) - ask vinnie ( an column where readers write questions , and pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice ) - hard rock news and notes - black and death metal news and notes - `` in the studio '' ( an update on bands currently recording new music ) -free poster ( in the middle of the magazine , there 's a fold-out poster of one or two bands . ) the poster is n't very wide , but it is about two pages long -free music downloads - '' ink spot '' ( a story about a musician 's favorite tattoo ) - '' favorite sh*t '' ( an interview with a musician , with questions such as `` what 's your favorite color ? '' ) -joke from a band ( revolver has just recently started doing this ) - reviews ( reviews of c.d . 's , music dvd 's , and video games ) pros : -- plenty of good pictures and a free poster -- professionally written with well known writers ( yet it is not too intelligent for teenagers ) -- edited well ( i have n't found any mistakes or typos ) -the `` fresh blood '' column usually introduces me to a band i have n't heard of , but i should probably check out -- revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews -- news columns ( on both mainstream and underground metal bands ) -the stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on -- free music ! ( revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password , which he/she can then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions in interviews ( they ask up to date questions , and sometimes-i.e . in the interview with puddle of mudd-the writers are n't afraid to ask daring , cutting questions ) -- the `` in the studio '' segment is always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they do n't automatically praise every heavy metal c.d . ) cons : -- if you 're up to date on your music news web sites , the news columns should n't really be anything new to you . -- not all c.d . 's are reviewed ( they give a rundown on the c.d . in the article about the band , but c.d . 's from bands that are on the cover of the magazine are n't usually reviewed . ) -concerts are n't reviewed -my biggest gripe is that it 's only issued once a month . the bottom line is , if you 're a metalhead , this is the best magazine you can get ! it is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment
1	organic gardening ( og ) is an excellent gardening reference for gardeners of all skill levels . in addition to hints and tips for growing flowers and vegetables naturally , each og issue is packed with all types of interesting , insightful , and often humorous articles covering a wide range of topics from composting to building a bat house . from farmers to container gardeners , og has something for everyone
1	this magazine is so delightful ! fantastic tutorials-great photos and wonderful info . i enjoy it very much and would n't hesitate to subscribe again . i heartily recommend it
1	if you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis , forbes and fortune are the two conventional choices . i started reading fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when i realized that the business people with whom i associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages . it fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits . fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends . you wo n't find anything radical here , but you need to have read it if this kind of news , analysis , and opinion fits your job description or personal interests . there is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson ' in each edition . for me , the highlight is stanley bing 's delicious , irreverent , and every so slightly jaded backpage column . i routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at bing 's corporate lunacy as i do . fortune is behind the eponymous fortune 500 and other derivative lists . for me , one of the most valuable is the magazine 's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue ' , though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests . other readers will tear out or access other fortune lists online with equal interest . if you 're in business or work with people who are , you 'd better be reading fortune or forbes or both
0	i was looking forward to a magazine that took a good look at different subjects than those covered in the mainstream media . what i received was a manual on how to think the `` right '' way . i 've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself , but i vaguely considered myself a liberal . man , was i wrong . clearly , liberal means much the same as the demonized `` conservative '' . this magazine has a single viewpoint , that of an ultraliberal ex-hippie who has found themselves wealthy in the 21st century . it is full of articles about `` finding meaning '' and `` reassessing life '' that seem to have been written by folks who drive chevy suburbans and pay too much for a cup of coffee . the magazine gives off a strong smell of covert superiority , and it made me nauseous
1	i have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years , and think it 's one of the best gaming mags available . i have several different consoles , and appreciate that they review games for all platforms . i like the rating system ( 1-10 ) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , and find the reviews well written and objective . while i have been gaming for years , i am not necessarily versed in computer lingo , but i never feel like an idiot after reading this mag ; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry . one suggestion : if you have a gamestop or affiliated store in your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . for about $ 15 you receive a 12-year subscription , and a card that gives you 10 % off used games at these stores , as well as an extra 10 % trade-in value on your used games ( sometimes there will be a coupon in that month 's mag to upgrade to 20 % for both ! ) .
1	this is simply the best woman 's magazine i 've ever read ! and i can say that i 've read a lot of them - both in the us and in germany . i 've read it for over 12 years and i can say that i never got bored with it . i 'm still excited about any new issue . the articles always matter and they catch just the right balance between being serious and entertaining . it 's for the modern young woman . to name a few subjects : career , love , sex , family , style , wellness , travel reports and interviews - every article going a bit deeper than the usual woman 's magazine . there 's really something to read for days . and on a side not : there 's more articles than ads !
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband . it took 5 months to get the first magazine , then i never recieved another one
1	if you have your own small business or start-up , or are even slightly thinking about starting one , this magazine is well worth the small cost . i usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others
0	i ordered this mag back in june , now it 's december and i 've yet to receive it . this equals a big fat zero in my book .
0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
0	sure i like a mystery- who does n't ? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story . the tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance . we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment . the value for money is horrible , the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- alfred hitchcock would not be proud
0	awful ! ! ! this is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry - mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets - and clothing . there were two `` articles '' at the very end of the magazine , and they were awful . one , on christmas in the english countryside , should have been beautiful . instead , it contained just a few pics and very little text . what a disappointment . do n't waste your money . first pick up a copy in the supermarket before you waste money on a subscription . once you see how really ridiculous this magazine full of nothing but ads really is , you wo n't waste your money on a subscription .
0	for ads only pretty much . there is not much to read or learn for the common reader . it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone .
0	this magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements . advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying , but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous . these ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine ... it seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness , to the level of competition . a recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women . some of the women had body fat below 10 % - i 'm trying to get mine below 30 % . it 's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness and shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice . i can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese . i ca n't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch , eat 10 servings of protein a day , and pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed with this magazine..
0	i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook . i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks . i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication . the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total . given that there are only 6 issues a year , i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages . the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information : simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their is n't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you . this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking . however , i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful . this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook . bottom line , i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little `` more meat '' in their content . i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive . i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their `` best of '' cookbook instead . it costs about the same amount , contains many more recipes , has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer . additionally , check out an issue of `` fine cooking '' which is another test kitchen type of publication , just with more depth .
1	this magazine is amazing ! ! it keeps getting better and better , unlike all the other sell-out magazines such as muscle fitness . it 's a shame it does n't have more readers ! if you like the mag then pass it around , people work hard to put it together ! a great buy !
1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason ... i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall . i had recently watched `` secretary , '' and i liked her , so i bought it . i 'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue . after buying my first flaunt magazine , i wanted to buy more , but needless to say , the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time ... : ( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there..
1	i have been subscribing to alfred hitchcock 's mystery magazine for many years . i find it an excellent periodical . the genres range from humor , cosies , hard-boiled detectives , to locked room puzzles , with an added dessert of a `` mystery classic '' at the end of every issue , some dating from the 19th century . i especially enjoy the absence of gore . the stories are just the right length to satisfy your `` mystery craving '' before bedtime . another kudo : the ahmm is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd-rom . called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at $ 19.95 that there would be no monthly cd-rom . they charged us another $ 10 to have the monthly cd-rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues . but that cd-rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine . you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine , but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd-rom . it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine
0	love to review history today , but have n't seen a copy yet . any ideas
0	i liked time magazine a lot until they named george bush person of the year ? oh my god , where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article
0	this was a gift for my daughter . instead of receiving the new yorker , she is receiving people . you need to fix this
