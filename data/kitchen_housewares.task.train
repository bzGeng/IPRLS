1	very nice , warm blanket , but too big for a full size bed , way too big
1	the glasses are nice quality , but like the majority of other people who ordered these they arrived broken because of insufficient packing material . you would think someone at amazon would fix the problem instead of shipping these over and over again
0	my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st . amazingly , i would have bought it after reading the reviews here . i 'm starting to wonder who writes these things ... lg employees ? the microwave is fine - no complaints . the toaster , however , is an unmitigated disaster . i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance is a poster child for this thought . the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently ( sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10 ! ) . more importantly , the toaster broke after 31 days ( coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time - best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named `` ricky '' managing the store what can you expect ? ) . lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty . the problem is they ca n't think outside of the box . they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up - ok ... no problem . one day later ? it breaks again . it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not . that 's how bad it was . lg will not budge - have it repaired again ( great option - costs lg money , me more travel time , and it wo n't do the job ) or do a rebate . the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product . huh ? so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace ( they admitted they do n't have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new ) and then do n't stand behind your product . you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought . how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here ? our we so bad as a manufacturer that we ca n't top this ? their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this . `` you can cal korea but they wo n't change their policy '' they said . i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same . shame on you lg - you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me
1	the stool fits under my kitchen table and is easy to move around . i bought this stool for my 3 year old grandson , he pulls it up to the sink when he wants to get a drink of water and he sits on it when he eats his lunch . he loved mine so i bought him one of his own
1	the plastic top has no vents thereby producing rubbery , boiled tasting popcorn . easily solved ! i drilled about a dozen 1/8 inch holes in the top ( bottom ? ) of the plastic bowl and voila ! wonderful , crispy , crunchy popcorn .
1	i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once . but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly , at first . but after only about 6 weeks of use , the flip-up spout broke off - actually just broke in half . i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good
0	the skinny grill satin black came in chestnut brown and brokken to pieces . still waiting for some relief in terms of a credit . i feel like the guilty party , even though all i did was give them my hard earned money and trust that they would deliver a product to me . so far ... computer form replys !
1	not fancy . but it does the basic jobs well . minor concern - better at baking than toasting . toasting takes a little too long and is not totally uniform . but for the price this machine ca n't be beat .
0	this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access . however it is not a good sharpener . it sharpens knives but not well . also , it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash . probably half a year and it will be useless . spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year .
1	great for the money . feel like expensive sheet . very happy with it . just hope it is available with other colors
1	we are really good about packing up our meat , vegis and fruit right after purchase . our vacuum sealer has saved us tons of money just from not tossing out stuff that goes bad quickly . the sealer came with rolls to make our own bags , but i found it too cumbersome ; these bags eliminate the difficulty .
0	this perch is a great size for a large cat or even two cats together . it is soft and appears to be very comfortable . however , the way it attaches is by affixing a strip of velcro to your window sill , which then mates with the matching velcro on the bottom of the shelf unit . there are two adjustable legs that are supposed to give support as they brace against the wall . my window ledges are not very deep and so the shelf does not sit level . the legs are adjusted to fit as closely to the wall as possible , however , mine do not move close enough in so that the legs stay securely on the wall and therefore , do not support the shelf properly . we have tried putting a piece of folded cardboard under the part that sits against the wall , but this has n't worked either . so unless you have very deep window ledges , this may not work for you . we bought two of these , but plan on returning one . on a positive note , my cats love the shelf and took to it right away . it is a great idea , but this one needs a little better design
1	it is very light and worm . i love it . definitely worth the price !
1	the coat rack works wonderful for us , we hang our robes ( tend to be thick and heavy ) before going into the hot tub . it was very easy to assemble , lightweight , yet it holds the robesas one expects a coat rack to do . i do n't understand the reviews that indicated difficulty assembling or trouble with its stability , none of that is the case for us .
1	still allows some dust deposits . live in az and do n't have water softener . need to change more often than recommended
1	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend . at the end of a hot day , the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside . ; this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside . it barely fit the width of my window , but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem . very easy to install and operate , there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high . perfect for smaller rooms . also the price is definitely right .
0	i have been looking for one of these for a couple of weeks . for the price , i thought it would work great . first , it was the size of a salt shaker ( did not read description well enough ) . second , upon first use while trying to apply a coating of powdered sugar on my funnel cake , i thought i was going to throw my shoulder out . the sugar just will not come out of the fine mesh in the lid . i had higher hopes for this . unfortunately , it is now packaged for a return journey back to amazon and i am continuing my quest for the perfect funnel cake shaker
0	it appears that the viatek product ( bark stop pro ) is related to the lentek design ( pc16 ; asin : b0002q89o6 ) - they are based on a common design by a lentek engineer . i have used ( tried ) the viatek bark stop pro and it definitely does not work . my experience was the same as another reviewer of the lentek pc16 who noted that the unit only works on the `` audible '' setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the `` ultrasonic '' setting . furthermore , it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds , banging doors , wind noise , etc . this really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality . i 've tried two different units and they both do not work . the negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks .
0	i spent about 20 minutes trying to ascertain how much this item cost , but to no avail whatsoever ! i 'm so frustrated after such a lengthy , yet futile search that i want to hurt someone ! instead , i 'm shutting down my browser . you idiots should think about how many more sales you 'd make if you just included a price , for god 's sake !
1	if you like fondue ... .you 'll like raclette ... as much or even more . use your imagination ... do n't stick with what is traditional . you can use your raclette for desert , pizza , breakfast ... .and much more ! traditionally served with steamed red potatoes ... .this will satisfy the `` meat and potatoe '' man in the group . marinade the meat with different flavors ... to add some spice . do n't forget the vegetables ... .slice onion , red peppers , mushrooms , romas ... and even pineapple . it 's a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends . extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot
0	i have nice sharp blades ... i sliced veggies , and got all these tiny little plastic `` hairs '' that the cutting mat gave off as i sliced it up along with my veggies . had to toss them . these mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough , or any other purpose other than for what they are made for ... chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects . for the price it was worth testing them out .
0	a few times it worked great , but mostly it brewed uneven . i 'm not being a nitpicker here ... literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim . there was no pattern to it , sometimes it was the left one , sometimes the right one , sometimes neither . filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging ... do n't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter ! it only took two days before i realized this was not worth the money or the time
1	i am very pleased with this product . the atelier wash is soft , absorbent and looks good after laundry . i have always found the martex brand to be top quality .
0	poor workmanship , rusted inside of chrome cover ( is it really chrome with rust on it ) , very poor construction of the rubber piece and is smells like rubber.i really do n't want to smell rubber in my closet .
0	i would rate this zero but that option is not available . the weight of the stainless steel is heavy , exactly what i had expected for 18/8 . however , the top does not affix to the base . it seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base . furthermore , the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base . that 's worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter . yuck ! i do not recommend the purchase of this product .
1	it 's not the most amazing space saving contraption in the world , but it works . definitely helps reduce clutter
0	this toy did n't even last 3 minutes . he had the stuffing out in 10 seconds flat
0	this is a hollow ground blade ( not flat ground ) which does not cut straight . the blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this . get a knife with a flat ground blade , not this one . you can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade . it is a cheaper way to make knives
0	i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house ... and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store . it sucks wonderfully , do n't get me wrong . the reason why it 's got to be returned to targetland is because of 1. the noise 2. the `dust that flies out of the dust cup when you 're emptying it . the noise is certainly the loudest i 've ever heard on a vacuum cleaner . but , i thought , hey , that 's okay if you want to be noisy ... until i ventured into cleaning the stairs . there 's not much of an extension between the cleaning wand/brush and the actual machine , so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris ( what have you ) from the stairs ' carpet , i had the crazy noise blasting `` turbo '' -style directly into my ear . ( this was done 15 minutes ago , and my ear still hurts ) . the other problem i 've found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup , i am having to actually touch dirt and dust ( the entire outside of the cup is coated with it ) . while pouring the dirt into the trash can , a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor ... nasty and what 's the point in the dust cup if this happens ? i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently ( it died after 2 1/2 years ) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup , nor falling to the floor . so , alas , my friends , i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store . mayhaps , i 'll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags ( you know , the old-fashioned kind )
1	i 've used this for indian food and it worked really well - you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala . btw i own other anolon advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup . re : the squishy handle . if you have gripping problems , as many middle age to older cooks do , this helps you . do n't listen to the young , self-involved , and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature . some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature
0	first , the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner . that can be overlooked , but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability . i may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks , no matter what setting i put it on . horrible to say the least . i sent it back and purchased a new one , which i enjoy to this day
0	i was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer . i have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were . i bought them because i liked the color , and the red is a very pretty , bright color . i would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets , or dry them on low heat . the material of the sheets is fairly thin , so i am not sure how long they will last
1	it makes the cleanest and purest coffee i have ever tasted . i also use a moka pot , a french press , and a drip and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot . to those who had failures and could not get it apart , i have no idea what you are doing wrong , there is little to go wrong . fill the lower pot , put on the upper pot with grinds in it , heat it , watch the water infuse the grinds , , remove from heat and let it go back down . what is there to go wrong ? if it fails to go back to the lower pot there must have been a vacuum leak , pull it apart and let gravity do it , or just stick something in it and dislodge the filter if you are in a hurry . there is no vacuum up top so how the coffee got `` stuck '' up there defeats all i know about physics , just dump the stuff into the sink if it fails to go back through the filter ; it is pretty simple . if it does n't work for you i 'd call it user error , try again , if you can boil water this should pose no problem i have used it 100s of times with not one failure
0	this is a cute vacuum , and that 's about it . the filter clogs , and they are next to impossible to find . the canister is a pain to empty . the biggest problem i found was there was no height adjustment . if you have thick carpet , you just need to forget about this vacuum . what a nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing . mine has gone to goodwill .
0	my girlfriend and i recently bought two ultrasonic humidfiers -- this machine and an air-o-swiss 7135 . the venta worked well when it worked . however , it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason . you could jiggle the thing , and it would go on and off . we finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base . the water was n't flowing properly , and the machine stopped ( as it should ) because there was no water . took it back to the hardware store where we bought it , and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem . it may be number 1 in germany , but it gets only 1 star here
0	the amazon product picture makes these trays look like they produce square cubes and will , therefore , rest upon each other without spilling . however , the product one actually receives from bic superstore are trays that produce longer , comma-shaped ice ; and the trays themselves do not rest on each other at all . the bottom of one tray freezes into the ice of the next , so you get a frozen block of ice and trays , all stuck to each other and impossible to crack apart without hot water . these trays are a big mess . they do n't nest without spilling ! and do n't be fooled by the `` - '' and `` + '' signs on the end of the trays , no matter how you stack them , they wo n't stack without spilling ! also , bic does n't share amazon 's helpful return policy , so buyer beware ! !
1	i got this pan because i 've been coveting all-clad when reading reviews of high-end cookware , and because of the low price . i figured that the low price made it a teaser -- something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line . it 's a nice pan , but limited . on the good side , it 's hefty , has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove , heats evenly and holds the heat . it is not non-stick , so i use it when i want the contents to produce the fabled brown bits that come up with deglazing . stuff sticks , unless you use a lot of fat . as noted by other reviewers , it does not have a pouring spout . the rim is squared off , so the pouring stream tends to be very wide . my other major gripe is that it does not have a lid . all-clad lids are pricey , like everything else in their line . i sometimes use a cheap tempered-glass lid with it . i still covet all-clad pans , but not as much as i did before
1	i just tried this out for the first time , and i was impressed . it baked evenly and nicely . best of all , the cake came right out . i simply sprayed it lightly with non-stick spray , and baked . due the flexibility of this product , you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability . i will be buying more from this line
1	i have used patton air circulators for the last twenty years , and if you are looking for something much more effecient than the common box fan that you see in department stores , this is really a fan . the first one i bought had the c.f.m . rating on it , which was 9600 -- -- they do n't put that on the fan anymore , but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate some air , and can be adjusted to blow straight up . nothing i have seen even comes close for the money -- -
1	i own reidel as well as spieglau . the differences are slight . the spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft/feel to them is very good . and , given the price , if i break one i do n't get upset as i would with a reidel . no wonder reidel bought the company . i recommend the spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive , well made glass , at a moderate price . anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more , as these do , deserve to be recommended
1	i searched for months for a stylish , durable set of flatware at a bargain price , and this is it ! i was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a friday sale . the design is unique and contemporary , and the finish and weight are of excellent quality . the only criticism that i have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons - the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher . however , this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous , inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come .
1	twixit clips are a wonderful product . they are extremely practical and very useful for all types of packages . i hope you continue to carry them . everyone i have given them to raves about them and wonders how they got along without them . i highly recommend twixits
1	cuts like a samurai blade quality , and does n't need to steel as frequent as the henckels/ wusthof knives . it has excellent weight for a medium sized hand . however , the handles get quite slippery when wet , so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety . also , if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel , do n't , because this global blade is much harder than the henckels/wusthof blades ; a qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must , or if you really like the steel design , get the global steel which can cost quite a bit . overall , this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed , just like a samurai would do to get use to his sword
0	as far as whisks for non-stick surfaces go , the silicone-encased wires are very flexible -- a far cry from the hard , thick plastic whisks with only a few wires . they are ideal for non-stick surfaces except for one problem . the silicone is soft and not durable . after a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer , the silicone gets easily cut . the silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose . i have been very careful , but this works out to probably $ 2 each time i used it
0	if i could give half a star i would . i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day . i used it less than 3 times a week . there are several drawbacks to this unit . it draws alot of electricity to run it . i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on . water gurgles/spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned . the spout is also poorly designed , the water does n't come out in an even stream , it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid . the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean . the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it . i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago . it is everything this kettle is n't and so much more . read the reviews on that one before you buy this one . its a better choice all around . save the shipping costs , time headache , just buy the braun first and pass this one up .
0	this red-and-white cutting board looks attractive and helps brighten up the kitchen counter . however , it arrived warped , so that i really can only use one side ( the board slides around on the counter when i flip it over )
1	it 's a quality product from krups which gives lots of froth ! sometimes too much . if you are not experienced capuchino maker this product is right for you
0	we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them . this coffee maker has two problems . ( 1 ) its spout is badly engineered . it is impossible to pour out the last 3/4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid . ( 2 ) it is a thermos ; so the machine does not heat up the coffee , but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed . i like hot coffee . after the first cup , i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave . this is inconvenient . i would not buy another of this model
1	i like these knives . very sharp and a value for the money . long term who knows ... i 've had mine a little over a year and completely satisfied
0	i 'm not sure how well this coffeemaker works . i purchased one from amazon and received one that was obviously in used condition . the glass was water stained and not factory packaged . there was n't a manual or any instructions . 1 star for amazon on this one
0	i also had the surprise and joy of having my carafe 's glass lining explode . the carafe had a little over 1.5 years of use , and i never used any sort of abrasive on it . note that for the price of this replacement carafe , you could pay for most of a whole new coffee machine
1	i am a boy . when i bouhgt this stuff it was the first time live without my family . i do not know the cookwre set . but my female friends always say `` where did get it ? '' or `` it look really expensive '' they alway said it 's good and reasonable price .
0	i received these as a wedding gift . not , five of my tall glasses are broken , and two short glasses ... none of which were from dropping them . one broke as i was hand-washing them , and cut up my hand . another literally broke as a guest was drinking out of it . i was so embarrassed
1	i purchased this for my niece who was pregnant at the time . she started using it right away . she said she feels like the last two trimesters were the easiest and gives credit to feeling healthier since using this juicer . she said it 's very user friendly , and easy to clean up
1	as everyone else has indicated , programming is n't intuitive . the opening was larger than necessary and my cats learned to stick their paws up inside the machine to steal more food within a few days . we blocked off half of the food shute by using two very small screws and heavy duty plastic and the cats were no longer able to sneak food between feedings . prior to using this feeder , the cats would wake us up at the crack of dawn , crying for food . now , they associate feedings with the machine and leave us to sleep in peace ! well worth the money for us ! !
1	miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure . but i want to recommend the seller witbecks -- wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually witbecks . when dhl screwed up their delivery ( an immensely crappy organization , but that 's another story ) , he stepped in and sent another unit without delay . terrific guy , terrific price , terrific service
0	this fan has nice features and operates very quietly . seems to be a durability issue with most reviews i 've read because mine only made it nine months before konking out
1	i got tired of dragging out my trusty box grater to do small jobs like grating nutmeg , ginger or parmagiana reggiano so i picked this little gem up . it feels good in your hand ( no surprise there ... it 's what oxo is known for ) is well-made and cleans up beautifully ... every time . it is so easy now just to grab this guy and grate what needs to be grated that i find i am using whole spices more and more . grab yourself one of these ... you 'll love it
0	i loved these sheets when i first got them . they look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them . after laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade , and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases ! i have laundered these in tide with no bleach ! what a shame they did not hold up well
1	i took a chance on ordering these , and i 'm glad i did . they are heavy-duty ! i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it 's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware . i 've also used these in a convection oven , and them seem to work really great ! i picked the `` sapphire '' color , and they are very attractive on the table as well !
0	we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now , and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version , it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen . clean up was a breeze , too . the worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable ' battery , which , withihn a year , took less and less of a charge after each use . now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once . it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately , which , in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence , but in turn , cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one
0	when you first unwrap these sheets , they look and feel great . but the true test is once they 've been washed a few times . they do n't hold up at all . they pill after only a couple of washings , and are thin and flimsy . i was really looking forward to giving these a great review , but i ca n't
1	my husband travels to uk frequently and it 's hard to find a good cup of coffee there . we 've looked everywhere for a portable coffee press that would work in a hotel room in conjunction with a hot water pot . this fills the need completely .
0	i bought the previous model of this dehydrator . i seriously would not even give this machine 1 star , but there is no lower rating . i bought mine a year ago , used it once , and the bottom heating element burned every single tray that i rotated to the bottom , which you have to do in order to get anywhere . the entire machine was worthless within a week of me owning it . i did eat the beef jerky , but that was the most expensive jerky i will ever make ! i called immediately to complain , talked to a guy named saul , who said the unit must be defective , duh ! and he would send me a new unit and a return authorization . i have gotten neither , i am just out the money . i have called back , faxed , mailed , waited on hold , and finally decided that ronco products are crap . i will never give him or his company another cent . buyers please research your purchases , i see from other reviews that i am not the only one with a complaint . buy a different machine
1	a great ice cream maker . no prefreezing bowls . it is loud so plan your ice cream making accordingly - you will not want to be in the same room as this thing when it is going unless you are already deaf lol ! the price of this remanufactured unit along with the amazon discount running at the time brought it to 125 with no shipping fees . try to get that on ebay ! this unit stays on my countertop at all times and attracts much interest from visitors . the ice cream is wonderful - i recommend ben and jerry 's cookbook and a good ice cream scoop . replacement parts can be found on the manufacturer 's website and are reasonably priced .
0	my beagle ( 13 mo . ) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time . does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks , not smaller barking or any form of whining ( even if extremely loud )
0	i am glad i only paid $ 60 for this . i see it 's now up to $ 90 . i am a bit disappointed in this purchase . it does slice well so far ( although i have n't tried slicing anything really thin like prosciutto yet ) but i do n't like the fact that i have to hold the on button down with one hand while cutting . i also found that when i used it to slice homemade bread that the slices get stuck in between the blade and the plastic guide at the bottom , so i have to stop and dislodge each slice , sometimes tearing them in the process . i also do n't like how loud it is and the fact that it sounds like it is working really hard all the time . it makes me question how long the motor is going to last . the catch tray is really useless ( as someone else pointed out ) and in addition to not doing it 's job it does n't store inside or attached to the machine in any way , so it just kind of gets in the way . if i decide to keep the machine i am going to throw it away . so all in all , i gave it two stars because it is a cheap slicer ( or at least it was at $ 60 i am not so sure at $ 90 ) but it works like a cheap slicer too , so you are definitely getting what you pay for..
1	i 'll admit , i had to learn how to use this turner because of its shape , but now i realize that it 's far better than any spatula i 've ever had . i can actually flip a burger now ! ! ( something i could never do before ) i 've got to check out more emerilware . you will not be disappointed -- this spatula is definitely worth it
0	we bought the scale for starting weight watchers but it does not do weights in fractions i.e . 1/4 lb etc . also it was not as pictured . the look of the scale ( in the photo ) was appealing because of the retro look with the red dial , ours came with a black dial which is just plane boring . average thought ... its just an average scale and nothing more
0	it was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though i always kept it charged . since this is the type of product you might take camping i do n't recommend it because it 's not reliable . i used it once or sometimes twice a day ... .no more so i really think it should have lasted longer
1	my six month old son would not eat anything off a spoon or out of a bottle . finally i tried mixing baby cereal and putting it in this . then i mixed cereal and babyfood and/or mashed food . he loves it ! no gagging either ! i 'm here now buying the replacement bags
1	once you cure it ( instructions included ) , this wok is as stick-free as teflon , but not as toxic . the handle stays cool , and it fits nicely on the burner with its flat bottom . it 's a well-made piece of cookware
1	started using these for a puppy , since i work irregular shifts . purchased a pad holder to stop her from shredding it . works great . no leaky messes and very little smell .
1	these are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully . i am very pleased with my purchase !
1	these are nice to keep a martini cold , but they 're a bit large .
1	this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with . i have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all . it 's so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors . the only complaint i have is that the pads are hard to get on . i have broke a few nails doing this , it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this
0	i like this type of opener very much , and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing . so i opened the package , and tried to open a bottle of wine , but the corkscrew would not lock . i 'm not even sure i 'll send it back given the warranty hassle , shipping costs , etc , given the price . i just ca n't recommend this brand to anyone
1	for the price these bath sheets are great ! very soft and plush . exactly what i was expecting
1	about a year ago i was looking for an espresso/cappuccino machine that would be both great in quality and easy to use . i also wanted it to look contemporary , to fit the style of other things in the house . on the other hand , i did n't want to spend a fortune for some expensive brands that run up to $ 12,000 . at that moment i was lucky enough to order from amazon breville 800jexl juice fountain elite . that juicer impressed me so much , that i was happy to buy breville 's whatever - which happened to be breville 800esxl die-cast espresso machine . it is reasonably priced for style and quality and so far i , my husband and all our guests are happy with both espresso and cappuccino . i only wish i could do more than 2 cups at the same time . a year later , i still think it was a great buy and it works as well as ever
0	oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low . i washed them once and they already shrank . what is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton . after i dry with them , i have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin . definitely a disappointing product even for its low pric
1	i bought these as i was trying to find my pattern on the internet . i love them ! they are great in the microwave and they match beautifully . perfect for a small dish of ice cream or peaches or to put salsa in for snacking .
1	ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months , and it is fun , weve already gone through a cleary water filter . our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy , and its fully programmable . i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos , as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth , dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon , water it down or add skim for a really nice froth . i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso , but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime . so far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me . i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past . i should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small , if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides , i would buy it
0	not what i expected ... i thought it did duo patterns of rosettes , but only does one . i ca n't not use other rosette patterns with the set . it does n't remain the heat , so it took longer to make the cookies .
0	i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone . the coffee does taste funny and i did n't realize it might be the metal pot . also , do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out . just like one of the other reviewers said , the pot does not slide in and out easily . not a coffeemaker i would recommend . the only thing i like about it is the size ! ! ! ! ! !
0	this tool is very poorly made . when grating cheese the handle tended to twist in the hand making it difficult to control and causing discomfort . with medium pressure during use , caused the drum to dent ! returned cuisipro grater . strongly dissatisified ! looks good , but a piece of junk
1	holds everything . makes perfect pot roasts . i use all clad mc2 for most cooking , but when i need to braise i use this -- i love it
1	i ordered the 45-piece place setting , it had to be the quickest turn around i have ever come across . ordered on a thursday , had it on a monday ! everything was in perfect condition . i am so pleased with amazon and the way they do business . i will buy from them again . the dishes are beautiful , i could n't be happier . thank you
0	i ordered it on 9/9 . at the beginning it would come middle of october . it was ok . however , delivery schedule had been changed . it is not arrived yet , nor i do not know when it will come . amazon knows this delay . however , they asked me to send a review of it . what does it mean ? i rated this item as 1-star ; it is not for the item , but for the seller , amason . amazon is generally good campany , i think . however , i can not accept my situation for this . honestly saying , i want to rate 0-star for this order
1	i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting . i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try . it does a perfect job ! i owned the original model when it first came out years ago . this one is more streamlined and improved . the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups .
1	this is a great pan . i have a larger one , but this one fits in my pressure cooker . makes a wonderful cream cheese cake in the pressure cooker
0	i bought this item at my local target the weekend i moved into my new apartment . the parts are quality chrome , and the wood top is certainly appealing to the eye . if only the pieces actually fit together to assemble a sturdy piece of furniture . one of the shelves does n't fit properly over the four legs , and the finished product sways at the slightest touch . judging by the glowing reviews on this page , at best , this product is a hit-or-miss venture . there 's a reason it 's priced at 30 dollars . buyer beware
1	as a vintner we remove the co2 from the wine as part of our process . this device uses co2 to `` pop '' the cork -- very clever . however this minor introduction of co2 is insignificant and will vent quickly . at times there is an off-taste -- like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine . let it breath for a while -- 5 minutes or so and it seems ok . this device works well on corks , but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics . do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective . rew
0	i hated these shakers . i got them as a gift and 1. they are too big and take up too much space and 2. the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3. the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once . finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out . the other , smaller fiesta ware ones -- the round ones -- are much much better
1	i have a 3 1/2 year old boxer that barks , cries , whines , and howls when i go to work ... all day ... i know , i recorded it . i went to petsmart and picked up this gadget . brought it home and it the manual correct button . she bolted . she hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes . it reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and i do n't crate my dog when i 'm going to be away for more than 8 hours . so if i 'm just running out for a few hours i stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if i 'm going to work i use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar . my girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he 's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it . worth the price in my opinion . best advice is to take it home and try it . some dogs react to it . others do n't
0	i got a set of 8 a few months ago . first one package arrived with a broken one , then all of them ended up broken . they break if you fill them with water and try to take them by the side . they break if you set them a little too fast on the table . one of them broke by just holding it . such poor quality i am extremely disapointed . but i loved the design though
1	the wonder washer appears cheaply made , but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine . it augments my regular washer nicely , washing small loads and delicate items well . on the debit side , the washer 's design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket ; a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items . the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly
0	i have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the senseo coffeemaker . folding filter paper did n't work ... .too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee ... .the quick-cup sounded like a good idea ... .but it does n't fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee . i found that the eco-pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well . the key to any of these re-usable pods is that water can not be allowed to go around the filter . the pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee . the quick-cup and the eco-pad are essentially the same design but the eco-pad fits the holder correctly and the quick-cup is slightly small . buy the eco-pad , it works . the quick-cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the quick-cup and the holder ... a gasket , to prevent the water from going around . good luck
0	my girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon . this is by visiondecor furniture . first it shows up on the curbside in pieces . did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together ? this is not including the cushions . the material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy . i do n't know if it will last a year . ikea furniture is actually better quality . paid around $ 550 with shipping , if she would have spent another $ 200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in los angeles . she is very disappointed and wants to cry . sad , very sad ...
0	this product is ok - it 's just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum . the head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint-catching fabric . the extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast , but for what it is , this attachment is ridiculously overpriced
0	read the description carefully . it states the speaker range is 50 ' not the microphone . my dog stood 10 ' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it would n't trigger . matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking . the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand . even then it did n't go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower . i also could n't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound . even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise . not just me but my husband too so it 's not a case of super human hearing on my part : - ) yes the timer option is very nice . this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking . but what good is the timer function if the microphone ca n't pick up the barking ? so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units . unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else .
1	`` i just received and tested my new miele office vac . even this lowest-end miele is fantastic ! it 's as quiet as the one i have at home , it 's similarly designed , easy to use , and works terrifically well . i am so pleased that i spent the extra money and got a really good vacuum .
0	works good except for with the cappicuion pods they dont brew throughly . but makes great coffee
0	do not buy this product . it is not supplied with a parts list to order parts that may become broken . if your call their customer service number , everyone is very courteous , however they want pictures of the power base , ( front-back-top and bottom ) as well as a picture of the menu book . they want all of this just to order a simple o ring gasket that goes on the the blender blade piece to act as a seal . they will not sell you this item ( package of 4 for $ 7.95 ) without all of the above information as well as a receipt . i find that all of this would be unessary if they would just supply a simple parts list . dyanand
1	i bought this as a gift for my mom for christmas . i do n't think she has used it yet but i 'm sure i did n't go wrong with a kitchenaid product . i currently own the hand mixer and large mixer and love them both . prices on amazon ca n't be beat
0	i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product , and the euro-pro was bad decision . the product would n't even turn on , much less work . the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control . whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped . the euro-pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality , boy was i wrong . if you 're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands . this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro-pro . too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas . a real disappointmen
1	i bought this set for three times for serving 12 people ! i also bought a lot of the additional to the set for my whole kitchen . great investment ! i love the feel of these dishes . very nice smooth feel but all the bowls look slightly different , the slight inconsistancys make you feel like you have a set of hand-made set !
0	i bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor 's mutt . the offending dog is often left on the neighbor 's porch , where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by . before ordering , i had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect . in my case , the neighbor 's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine . unfortunately , this was not `` too close for comfort '' as far as the dog was concerned . having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices , i was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working . alas , it did not . some dogs just do n't hear them . in my case , it was probably due at least in part to the distance . my suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20 ' of the target . if it does n't work , go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund ( which is exactly what i did ) . by the way , you do n't need an ra ( aka rma ) number to return the device . just send it to the company along with your receipt , and a note saying that you would like a refund ( not an exchange ) . ( ... ) i sympathize with anyone having this problem , and wish you all the best of luck . no one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason , and the argument that `` dogs bark '' simply does not hold any water
0	we purchased this purcolator for christmas 2003 . every other pot is weaker than tea , many grounds are left in the bottom of the pot . once the coffee is done , the warmer continues to boil the coffee making it bitter and burnt . the auto shut off did not work and boiled the pot dry . i am returning the pot and purchasing a farberware for half the price
1	my husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me . i thought okay until i opened the package . this shamrock green is so pretty . this dinnerware is great . a nice heavyweight . the glazing is brillant . and the cereal bowls are a good size . not too small as other types tend to be . i am very happy i own this and have bought more since
1	this is a good bat house but does n't come with a pole . i would recomend buying a pole or just hanging it somewhere
1	pros : i have two chocolate labs , therefore , i have a lot of hair to deal with . the vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt ( wood floors ) . it works alright on rugs . cons : not cheap . loud . the plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you ca n't carry it , you just have to roll it instead . not a big deal
0	we ordered a cherry coat rack ( keep in mind cherry is the only color option available on this site for that item ) and it came as light oak . i tried to get it exchanged , but they were going to make me pay for shipping cause `` it wasnt their fault . '' i dont know whose fault it is , but i ordered a cherry , i got something totally different , and their `` customer service '' didnt service me , and wasnt customer friendly . never again
0	while cute , this little pan is difficult to use . there 's no room to use a spatula , so you 'd better like the eggs cooked through - you ca n't flip for over easy , and the egg white is too deep to do sunny-side up . also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip , so you have to use a potholder . plus , it 's so small that it wo n't fit any normal-sized burner - another burn risk to your fingers
0	very hard to get any actual pepper to come out of this thing . i just put some pepper on eggs and it took over 10 squeezes . imagine trying to grind pepper out for a stock pot full of soup . impossible
0	you may as well put your betta in a glass of water . the argument is that bettas are naturally found in rice paddies in thailand ... go ahead and google images of a rice paddy . bettas can live in small areas due to a special lung that lets them breathe air directly ... humans can live in cars , but should they ? and the tiny stick of bamboo is a joke , adding insult to injury . they have nothing to retreat or hide behind at all in this kit . bettas were not put on this earth to make your office pretty . if you want a betta , get them a proper tank
1	about a month ago , a friend gave me her gf tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen . in return , i grilled up some home-made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper ! i really love this grill . even though it 's got a big surface area , it 's no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away , and it cleans really easily . my tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm ; the charred stuff wipes right off ! i wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles , like the smaller g5 version does . just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby ! i do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage , though , given its size . bottom line : i 'd highly recommend this grill , especially if you 're using it for a family of four or more
0	was very disappointed in this comforter . while it is heavy like i had anticipated , it is not soft in any way shape or form , it is like newspaper , it crackles on the bed and makes noise all night long
0	i purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars . i also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other take up little space . after first use , the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged . i tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out - would n't recommend
1	i found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate . it 's a soft light ( almost seems like a natural spectrum ) and is very directed at the page . the clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover , and the neck is flexible as needed . so , functionally , it gets a solid a . but i was n't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries ( two of those round watch/calculator batteries ) . replacing them is a hassle ( though inexpensive ) because i have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before i leave , and i have to find them in a store with an electronic department . i wish this light took aaa or something . the light does include batteries , so you wo n't need to worry until you run out . for me , that was probably around 20 hours or so
0	i have had this scale for about 4 months . it worked fine the few times i used it , but last night i went to use it and it has given up the ghost . i swapped batteries and still nothing . the connection for the 9v battery is very loose , and even after crimping and holding it tight it did n't get any juice . not happy so i will order a different brand and hope it does better . i do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets , so maybe i just got a lemon
0	the bed warmer was described as `` dual '' controlled . it comes with only one control . the entire bed has to be at the same temperature . the reason i wanted `` dual '' control was because my husband is always warm and i 'm almost always cold -- - hence , seperate controls were needed . since we had the coldest winter in years , i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described . it does heat well though
1	best investment i have ever made in cookware . heats evenly , more thoroughly and burns less . amazingly tough and the best part is i do n't have to hunt for special `` plastic '' utensils to mix and stir . this is sweet cookware and so dang easy to clean , i love it !
0	we bought this model because it had the different grind capabilities . it quit working after 1 year . we also bought one for my mom and her 's quit much sooner . : -
0	i bought 4 of these light sets after seeing them in real simple magazine . i thought they looked and seemed to be a perfect option for my kitchen ... ... wrong ! after only 15 minutes , my brand new batteries ( 4 aa ) seemed to fade , and within an hour ... ..dead . i thought this is a mistake , and bought new batteries again , only to be upset when the same thing happened ! i called the manufacture about getting the adapter 4.8v it requires ... ..only to be told they do not sell to the public and i would have to track it down at radio shack , etc . well , i have had no luck on that yet ... ..lots of 4.5v , but no 4.8v . i wish i could send these back . they were a complete waste , and if i ever find the proper adapters , i will certainly use them . but that defeats the purpose of me choosing wireless lighting , does n't it
0	like everything in the world , this coffee maker is lawyer approved . in other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm . unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee . every day i have to warm my coffee up in the microwave .
1	this is a very good product . it is exactly as it is pictured and described ; clear , insulated , unbreakable , and does not leave a ring on your table . the company is very quick shipping , along with great follow up and follow through . a fine product , and i will be ordering more
0	do n't waste your money on this . unless you like your coffee luke warm ( i ca n't imagine it ) you will not be satisfied with this product . i am promptly returning mine
0	i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats , they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go . what a disappointment ! ! they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on ! the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments . trust me , if you have to choose between the two , do n't spend your money on on cs2 , however , it may appeal to the ( human ) avid bird watcher ... ( ? )
1	i just bought my second one . the first alarm hangs in our kitchen and does go off with a nice loud alarm when i seriously scorch dinner . it 's easy to turn off with the huge button in front . no false alarms here , only goes off when there is smoke nearby
0	i returned the item because it fell apart as i was attempting to put it together - cheap , compressed wood by-products and card board . even though i did receive a full refund after it was returned , i would not recommend it to anyone else . i was able to find a solid wood and better made shelf from another vendor
0	my daughter needed this item for an event and the wrong item was delivered . by then we were under a time crunch so i talked to customer service but there was no way target would expedite shipping the correct item to arrive in time . i had to order the item from another supplier and pay for 2 day delivery . in the meantime , the online pathway for getting a shipping label to return the wrong item lets me spend time putting all the information in but then shuttles me to a `` try again '' screen . i try half a dozen or more times and give up . an hour later i try again with the same dead end . i email customer service to just send a label by email but have yet to receive a response . the next day i try again with the same dead end . i have wasted a lot of time for something i do n't even want . i think i will let my credit card company know to not pay , and let the supplier ship me a return label when they get around to it . can you tell i am not impressed with the 'service '
0	bought a global knife a few years ago then bought the water/ ceramic sharpening device . can not keep this knife sharp . it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels . i use the cheap sabatiers ( $ 9 for the set and the block ) anway it 's no worse than any of my other dull knives just cost mor
1	you would never know it was reconditioned , it is probably even better than new , plus being dishwasher friendly makes even easier to use..
1	it was nice to be able to purchase just one mug . the delivery was quick .
1	unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome ; distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time . with normal bread in before lowering , the bread sticks almost 1/2 way out of the toaster , making it very easy to remove hot toast , to toast smaller items ( the plunger will go up even further to assist ) ; the slots are extra wide so , although i have not used the sandwich cage accessory , i can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage ( apparently a british idea , and maybe something worth investigating ) . i am doing normal toast on only setting 2 , bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect ! ( bagel feature : push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right ) . the machine feels solid as if it will last a long time . the cobalt blue color is more of a bluish-purple in normal light , but very attractive . very happy with the machine ( the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping !
0	the spice rack looks nice . wo n't know the quality until i can use it and see how much weight it will take . i had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet . it is definitely a 2-person job and there was only me . the self-adhesive tabs did n't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws . very awkward to use the screws . does n't allow for any room especially the back screws . i did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits . now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible . i would n't have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet . took much too much time to get it into place
1	we bought our french skillet two years ago , and it has yet to even have one scratch on the cooking surface . it can go in the dishwasher , and although we usually hand wash it , it is nice to know that easy clean up is possible . it gets used in our house every day , and is very durable . i am planning on purchasing more for my family ! we also have a covered pan and a six inch pan that we use almost as much . in my opinion , you wo n't be disappointed in this pan
1	i 'm puzzled by the several reviews that say the filter gets moldy too fast . i am replacing my first filter after about a year because it has built up deposits of lime . i never noticed any mold
1	i bought the fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living in arizona . the butter sold there is packaged in shorter , wider , and higher sized sticks . so , it did n't fit into the butter dish unless i trimmed it ! ! could n't figure it out , why would they make a butter dish that a stick of butter wo n't fit into ? ? ! ! so ... .have just moved to the houston area , and guess what , the butter here is sized just right for the dish . maybe they need to make two different sizes for west and east coast butter ? ? crazy ! nice butter dish , though
1	there is n't a lot to say about this , other than this pan demonstrates the kitchenaid high quality that one would expect from kitchenaid . it 's extremely well made and of very high quality
0	i am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs . amazon 's listing says this innotek trainer comes with a `` lifetime warranty . '' i 've read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars , so i decided to review the owner 's manual to learn more about the warranty . [ ... ] the last page has a section entitled `` lifetime limited warranty , '' which states `` . . . innotek brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship , under normal use , for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase . '' the `` lifetime warranty '' apparently expires after one year ! further on it says , the company `` offers several product exchange options during the warranty period . . . . costs are dependent on the processing time . '' this suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year `` lifetime '' warranty . the next paragraph says `` after one year from date of original retail purchase , we will repair , replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate based on the component . '' what will these repairs cost ? this leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from innotek . what , if anything , is warranted for a `` lifetime ? '' if the lifetime warranty is really only for one year , why call it `` lifetime ? '' and finally , what will repairs cost , both during warranty under their `` product exchange options '' and afterwards under their component-based `` fixed rate ? '' my specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery . the manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable . does this mean the user will have to send the collar to innotek to replace the battery and , if so , what will it cost ? i have contacted innotek through their website and will report back if i get a response . until i do , i 've got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty . can anyone comment on warranty claims to innotek

0	we ordered 2 of these wafflemakers.one for a present for my daughter in college . it never worked from day one . the second one worked for 2 months then quit heating up . calls to villaware company resulted in them telling us to `` ship them back '' . shipping costs would have been above $ 30.00..then what if new ones do n't work ... do i pay to ship those back too ? do n't waste your money on these.yes , when they work they make great waffles , but only when they work ...
1	after the handle broke off the carafe that came with our krups aromacontrol ( after about 2 years of use , perhaps several times a week ) , i found this one and ordered it . my belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off , however i am perturbed that i had to go to the trouble of replacing it . one would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components . i am not entirely sure , but it is possible that the plastic ( abs ? ) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured . i searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem , which is at the same time comforting and annoying . upon receiving this carafe , i was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it . i prefer a certain heft , and i assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made . however , this has proved not to be the case ; moreover , the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing . further , i think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe ( inside ) on this model . the advantage of this is that the coffee pours better ( a tighter stream , not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe ) , however , i it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult . in all , it is superior to the original , however i am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off . i assume that they have fixed this problem in this model , however i can not be sure of this . i also must say that it is a tad over-priced , and that perhaps [ ... ] might be a more reasonable price . the only reason i did not get a new coffee maker is that the aromacontrol works well and makes good coffee ( i use illy )
0	i know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer , but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside . i took out the battery and found water in the compartment . i give it as many as two stars because until the water got in , it did work as advertised . and seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing , i 'm wondering if i just had a bad o-ring . now , i 'm off to find a better thermometer
0	pretty , but started rusting on the edges after first wash..would not buy these again..
0	searched for a long time to find a good quality espresso machine that did n't cost over $ 500 . we had a great workhorse krups combo espresso coffee machine that was still working after 15 years . was hoping this one would be the newer , more powerful , fancier model . boy are we sorely disappointed . the coffee part works fine . unfortunately the espresso part leaks all over from the gasket and does n't even produce hot espresso . i exchanged this once , hoping i just got a bad one but apparently the krups xp2010 is designed badly . shame on krups for releasing a premature , untested product
1	these are simply beautiful glasses . they are every bit as elegant as reidel , but cost much less . the glass is thin , the shape is elegant , they hold up well in washing . i recommend them
1	this is absolutely , hands down , the best toy we 've gotten for our dogs . we own three sets of these in varying sizes . because the balls are plush , they will wear out- this is not for your destructive chewers . our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day . before leaving for work , pop a couple of treats inside and you 're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks .
0	these rings are much too big and too lightly made for egg muffins and the eggs spill out the bottom of the rings . total junk . do n't waste your money on these ring
0	for the price , you get what you pay for . they are not the best quality
0	had somewhat higher expectations , given that this was a lennox . got the shaker home . tried it out , it leaks . no matter how hard you hold the darn thing together , it leaks . i am a materials engineer so i gave the product a more than cursory examination . very , very poor quality . also made in china ( if that has anything to do with quality ... hint hint wink wink ) do not buy
1	this lamp went together with no problem . the pieces fit tightly and the lamp stands perfectly upright . it is more brownish than reddish . but i believe that it can go with many colors , especially pastels . the design , color and simplicity make this a very classy lamp . the slate shade is gorgeous and much tougher than i thought . this lamp , as most lamps , is not made for grabbing and moving too much . put it where you want it and enjoy it 's beauty ! buying this lamp is a win-win situation
0	the stainless steel lid has a glued in plastic piece that is supposed to provide an airtight seal to the canister . my canister arrived with the plastic piece no longer glued in place . i expected a bit more from a $ 50 coffee canister . i 'm returning it and going in search of a quality canister
0	although i have used this model before and have all good results , the one i bought for christmas did not work . jura capresso states that they test their machines before they leave the factory . they might have tested mine and it may have worked , but all it did for me was spit out hot water underneath the tray . i tried different grind settings but to no avail , water flowing out the bottom of the machine . too bad as this was a gift for all of my family . imagine the look on their faces when all they got was water dripping onto the floor
0	i did n't get this order , did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf . number and when the credit was given .
0	i received the shake-n-take as a gift for christmas 2006 . mine just broke down this morning . the motor gave out . i did n't really get 2 weeks of service out of it
1	i got two of these . one for me and my wife and one for my sons room . we live in nyc ( queens ) and its two floors down to laundry room . the house is old and stairs are very steep , no building codes back in 1901 . carrying a basket down stunk , door ways are narrow in my house so always jammed my fingers . this is great , roll it down up stairs no jammed fingers . if anything i would prefer a taller handle . i am 5'10 '' and its just a bit to low . for my wife its perfect height . gave it a one star ding do to shipping costs . man was almost as much as the two hampers cost to buy . its shipped from target , but target does n't carry them in store , only on-line . and i have seen these in stores for more than twice the price here . so it 's about even . good hamper , takes up minimal space and great for you with narrow doorways and steep stairs
1	high quality , soft and absorbent . large , all cotton bath sheets are exactly as described , and really hold up in laundering and usage . great items
0	the decanter 's pretty , the wine topper is okay . however , the picture is misleading . these two items are clearly not meant to be paired . the topper does not fit ... . must have been very carefully balanced for the photo , but it sure wo n't stay that way . the topper is made for a bottled wine , not a decanter .
1	sturdy well made spatula . perfect for use in 12in to 16in woks . for the price you just ca n't go wrong
0	ok well unlike the other reviewers , i hate this ice cream scoop . yes , it 's heavy and seems to be well-engineered . however , i do n't like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it . and as another reviewer already mentioned , it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed . when i 'm scooping the ice cream , the water drips out and down the handle , thus making it even harder to grip the handle . it makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and i get ice cream all over my hand . i have a cheap $ 2 plastic scoop that i bought when i was in college , and i prefer it to this one .
1	very satisfied with the system . makes water tastes go away . water should not have a taste at all and brita makes it that way
1	this is the best , most beloved item in my kitchen ! ! ! i only wish i had bought the grinder and all the different cups ( which i am going to now add on ) . i read some of the other reviews -- -and at first i was also disappointed with this blender . now that i have learned how to use it , i love it ! ! ! do not put protein powder into it first , it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup which you invert onto the blades ( when you invert it , the bottom becomes the top ) . if you put liquid in first and then the powder there 's no problem . you have to learn how to use it . you will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick . i read the reviews here before i bought mine and a woman said hers was junk but i went ahead and read the rest of the reviews and decided to buy it . if mine breaks in a year , it will have been well worth the price . i use it every day and sometimes three times a day . on a hot day when i want something slushy and cold , i 'll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice -- -in a flash you have a refreshing drink . it 's fabulous . i could use my cuisinart , but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison . there are no buttons to push , you just fill the cup with your juice ( i often add protein powder ) and something frozen ( ice or frozen fruit ) and screw on the lid ( which have blades in it ) and put it on the blending base and twist . you can either twist and pusle it , or twist and leave it to blend on its own . then you take the lid off , rinse , and that 's it . i love hummus and i will never make it in the blender because you have to dig it out and most of it gets left behind . with this gadget , you fill the cup , blend it , then screw off the blade lid , screw on the refrigerator lid , and that 's it . nothing to scrape , just put it in the refrigerator . ( oh yes , you do have to rinse off the blade lid , that 's the whole clean-up ) . if you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend , this is a great gadget ! ! ! i live in two places and i am getting another one for the other place , but i 'm buying the complete set this time
1	we have almost all of santa fe collection . it 's colorful and brings a smile to your face early in the morning during your breakfast and everytime you have a meal . plates are of a good size , bowls are perfect for cereal or fruit . and the mugs , oh ! they are so unique ! their shape and their size are just what we were looking for . my husband says it 's perfect for his morning latte . the pieces of this set are heavy and nicely made . we have 2 sets of 2 sets of these place settings and they are on everyday use . bigger pieces , such as pasta bowl , dip and chip bowl we hand wash . the other pieces go strait to the dishwasher . never had a problem , in fact we 're proud owners .
0	this product did not come with all that was advertised
1	overall this is a very nice item . i have been using it to make mojitos and it works wonderfully . the only negative thing i have to say about it is the handle could be longer .
0	we had a set of chicago cutlery knives for many years and thought they were good quality . over time , the wooden handles dried out and the blades did n't sharpen very well . so we replaced them with this set , but were very disappointed . the blades rust after very brief exposure to water . we are still using the old ones
1	i have the black fusion in my home office ( which is next to a basement-level theater room ) , and my wife and i already love this machine . we have tried all sorts of mixes , and we 've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do . this is one of the first times i 've been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it . physical properties : it handles travel mugs ( if you remove the drip tray , which is largely unneeded anyway ) , and all our `` standard '' mugs . the drink head moves up and down , so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks ( more common with `` frothy '' drinks than coffee and tea ) . when it brews a filterpack , it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out ( and , thus , keep it from dripping as you remove it ) . the water tank could be larger ( if only because we 're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long ) , but if you have a ready source of water nearby , it should n't be a problem . the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo ( which we also have ) . flavor-wise : it 's made by m/mars , so you can bet that the sweeter drinks ( the so-called indulgence fare ) is excellent . coffee blends are quite good , especially the darker roasts like `` french roast '' and `` sumatra '' . lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks , moreso than other chains . clean-up : wipe the inside of the drink head , and possibly the front of the plastic column ( the colored portion ) after any particularly `` splashy '' drinks . no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine , especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug . of course , you ca n't watch its magic when the drink head is that low , so your first few times , you 'll probably get a drip here and there . final bits : we 've had the senseo since its launch . between pods that need `` pre-wetting '' to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks , the senseo is lagging behind the flavia . we drink coffee , tea , espresso drinks , mixed blends , and sweet-tooth-friendly `` indulgence '' mixes every day with the flavia , and it 's brain-dead-easy to use . certainly easier to clean up after , too ! if you 're on the fence between the flavia and other single-cup offerings ( like senseo ) , get the flavia . keurig and other single-cup offerings ca n't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia . i 'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now , made over ice , and it 's fantastic . highly recommended
0	i am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the kitchenaid brand . this blender is only one of several ka appliances i have purchased that only lasted about a year . i do n't use a blender much , maybe once a month , so when this died after only eleven months , i was shocked . kitchenaid was no help whatsoever . my husband took it apart discovered that the motor still works , but the on/off switch went bad ; however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender ! ! after years of brand loyalty , i am sad to say that i will not be buying anymore kitchenaid
0	i have been looking for a good cheese plane , and this one is n't it . it works fine for rubbery semi-soft cheeses like swiss , but not for harder cheese like cheddar , which tend to crrumble before i can finish a slice . the problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid . it should be thin and flexible . also , do n't let the name fool you . this utensil is made in china , a country which consumes very little cheese
0	first of all the item is too small . it is about 1/3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1/3 as wide . so as you can see it is pretty small . so it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again . it does not make life easier . good in principle but does not work .
1	the nordic ware sunflower pan is just what i wanted . it came in perfect condition and in a very timely fashion . thank you
1	this vase is beautiful . i 'm considering purchasing the matching hostess pieces to complete the set
1	buy some rechargable batteries ( 4-aa 's ) and you 're set ! this fan has saved me time and time again at work when a hot flash hits . just having some airflow around my face seems to help . it 's not a whirlwind , but just enough
1	the fact that you do n't have to rotate the trays like some other dehydrators is great ! we have made a lot of beef jerky since buying the snackmaster express . it is a great product , works great
0	i ordered the product and thought i was getting the large size . i called the shipper , no returned calls and i ca n't really use the item shipped as i needed the large item . how do i return , the shipper does n't return the calls . not a happy customer of this product
1	this is a fine dehyrator . it 's quick and powerful . the description says the trays are 13.5 inches but that text was lifted from the description for the fd-50/60 . this model ( fd-1010 ) has 15.25 inch trays which adds almost one square foot to the area of the 13.5 inch tray . multiply those larger trays by 30 ( the maximum capacity ) and you got a huge amount of drying surface
0	if you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed ... do n't ! i have two areobeds ; i bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out . the pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it . fifteen years later it still works like a charm . i liked it so much ; i recently bought a minute bed because i needed another guest bed . it does not say anywhere on the box that you can not use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours . needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa . the battery is nicad , which means it develops a memory , so now even if i remembered to charge it the day before , it does not run long enough to inflate the bed . they do not offer a separate electric , detachable pump , so now i 'm stuck with a `` plastic carpet '' that can not be inflated with anything else . the areobeds work great , but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion , buy a different type .
1	i really like the electric skillet , it is the first one , i have bought . it is big enough to fry a chicken cut in half , both halves at once , and deep enough to make a stew . easy to clean just like promised . the only thing i was not so happy about was the handles . they give a lot , they bend , and one of mine is already broken . but that is really the only complain i have and i consider it a minor and would buy the skillet again
1	i gave it as a gift , she loved it since the granite roaster she had for over 20 years had gotten a small hole in the bottom from so much use .
1	i 've changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years . i can not get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself . that said , i still have reasonable water pressure and here 's the amazing thing , my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it . who knew that for all my life , it was the water , not my hair . my skin is not as dried out ... if i could work out the little glitches , it would be perfect . i own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it 's fab for the price !
1	for many years i had a presto pressure cooker , but when the sealing ring did n't work a few years back i tossed it out thinking i could never get a replacement ring . i missed having that pot . i 'm glad to have one once again . stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one , but tonight will be spare ribs . the new pot is nothing like my 30 year old one . it works the same in the end , though . i would have opted for the aluminum as that was what i had , but my husband bought the stainless steel . i do n't think it makes a difference for the price , except in appearance
1	this is a nice product . it gets the job done . i have to disagree with the one reviewer . the description plainly states that the board is made of polyethylene . the midnight granite signifies the color . for $ 9.99 , 14x17 is a great price
0	i thought this glass would be of better quality than it is . it took 3 shipments ( re cieved and returned ) to get my complete order without any breakage . these glasses are too fragile and in practice , impractical . because of the design , one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass . not too appealing when you are observing the `` legs '' of your wine . recommend that you pass these by
0	not up to standard set by other kitchenaid pro line appliances . when dessert is frozen will not dispense even with mix engaged , when thawed , dessert turns to near water consistancy . no way to remove dessert other than through dispenser . no control to modulate freezing , either on or off , manual setting . when front comes off for cleaning , retained liquid runs down the front of the machine short of the drip pan .
1	i love this salad spinner . it works easily for two people , spins great , and best of all , it keeps salad incredibly fresh for many days . i highly recommend it
1	locally one box of 5 runs about 2/3 of the cost of this case lot of 5 boxes . a terrific savings
0	i was excited when i read the great reviews for this product , but i was very dissapointed when i received it . i wanted this because i live in an apartment complex where i have to carry my laundry some distance to the laundry room . i thought it would be great to just be able to wheel it over with this . however , when i tried to put it together out of the box ( it requires complete assembly ) , though it is simple to put together , not one of the small screws that hold the top bars on to the unit fit ! all four will go half-way in and no further . perhaps i got a faulty unit , but i see it falling apart soon because of this . also , the bag itself seems flimsy . i was also happy when i read that this rolls quietly , however , they must have been rolling it on carpet because out on the concrete walkway that leads to the laundry room , it is extemely noisy - i ended up carrying anyway so as not to disturb my neighbors . the only thing this unit has going for it is it looks nice and holds a surprisingly large amount of laundry . if you are just using this in your home , it might work well for you , but if you need to take it out to a laundry facility , go with something else
1	this is a killer machine . it is a little noisey but well worth the small inconvience . i have been using this for three weeks and am lovin i
1	light and non-cotton , these are like spounges and they work far better than any dish towel i 've used previously . i have n't washed these , but if there 's a problem , i 'll update
1	this is a very useful shot glass as you can see . use it for measuring cocktails or for drinking a shot of your favorite liquor . it is a very sturdy glass . i highly recommend
1	this is an excellent product . if you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium , and making huge messes , walking in puddles , etc..and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks , this product is for you . do n't waste your money on cheap suction devices , and buy the python today ! ( sorry if i sound like an infomercial , i 'm just an enthusiastic user ) . the python attaches to your faucet , you turn the water on full blast , stick the suction tube end into your tank , and you can drain your tank in minutes , or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes . then , you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up ( again , in minutes ) . i have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon , as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank , and what used to take me a whole day , now takes about an hour ( to do all tanks ) . i like that i can vacuum the gravel , boy does this thing suck the waste up . this will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great ! i was skeptical that this product would work , but am so glad that i bought it . now i actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it . the directions are easy to follow~ even for people like me , who are `` direction impaired . ''
0	seriously , for as good as their mixers are , their knives are really , really disappointing . flimsy , dull , easily bent and broken . within the first week of use , our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re-straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later . the steak knives are now following suit , and the handle of the chef 's knife has completely seperated from the blade . gah ! do n't waste your money
0	i previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store , but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal , so i bought these as replacements . the previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal . the rubber sections on these are so thin that they did n't even seal the wine bottle i first tried them on . all three stoppers in the set had the same problem . oxygen and leakage are death to a wine , so a stopper that does n't seal is worse than just replacing the cork
0	i purchased this machine in november 2005 . when working it is a wonderful but it started to leak within 6 weeks . i sent it back for repair or replacement , 3 weeks later i received a badly damaged box , not the shipping box but the bodum box . the replacement had a manufactures date of 03/04 , 2 years old . it had obviously been used , coffee and water stains were present several scratches , and parts were missing . i called customer service and the supervisor promised they would ship a new one immediately and i would receive it no later than 2/23/2006 . three days after i was promised i would receive the new machine it has yet to arrive . i called customer service today and was informed they have no record of shipping a new unit and could i call back next week . the very used replacement machine was shipped back last week . i regret making this purchase
1	these are a purchase to go with wamsutta sheets . my daughter likes extra pillows . these wash very well and are nice and heavy duty . pillow cases are usually expensive . for $ 2.99 at the closeout price , i got a bargain !
1	this is my first `` electric '' litter box . i have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up . it really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box . it was a breeze to set up . i also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats ' bathroom floor . and with the tent they ca n't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a bm on the floor . i 'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down
0	this was given to us about last christmas to replace our old one ... not worth it ... a couple months into our ownership of this item , it stopped working properly . the right burner remains on at all times - we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off . so the right burner remains on hi all the time , and the left burner is either lo or hi , there is no concept of temperature control with this device ... if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things ... if it 's a centimeter above medium it 's hot - if you want medium heat to work , good luck . it worked ok until it broke , however it was never especially powerful . i ca n't even tolerate trying to cook with it anymore , i just go to the apartment downstairs and cook on my boyfriend 's mom 's gas stove for nice even heating . but a ministove that they are dubbing 'professional ' should not be breaking after like , three months
1	i have three cats and bought this to keep one of them away from my door . it works very well on two of them but the one i wanted to deter is a siamese . if you read the fine print it does state it might not work on some exotics . it also wo n't work if your cat has hearing problems . for all others it is great
0	this is junk . the blades tore through the plastic with the first potato i tried to slice . the apple slicer broke on the 4th apple . the blades are not sharp , and takes considerable force to get it to slice anything . the julianne attachment would not slice a block of chedder , though i do think any attachment would be able to slice brie , and if not that , then perhaps jello . worst purchase i ever made with the name kitchenaid on it
1	the pizzelle baker performed very well . the batches of pizzelles were excellent and the recipes included were good . i recommend this pizzelle iron .
0	i bought this lid in hopes it would fit on an old revere pot i have . i does not . it is a fine product , but it is too big for my needs . the main failing of this item is that nowhere in the description was a statement of the precise size of the item
0	i 've had my vacuum for a few years now only b/c i 'm too lazy to buy another one . however , i am at the end of my rope . from day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time i was vacuuming on hardwood . if i accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb , the belt broke . i took to buying lots of extra belts whenever i went to the store . the other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason . i promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute i turned the vacuum on . i say : no more . i am now determined to buy the best vacuum ever . i do n't care how much it costs ! ! the only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch ; and it is pretty powerful . but that 's it . changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers , i frequently run over the cord . something just was n't designed right there ... you 've been warned
0	i might have bought these pans if i could find out how deep they are
0	i bought this fryer and used it twice . the 3rd time i got the error message on the screen and could not get it to work , even hitting the reset button would n't get it going . i had to take it to an authorized dealer for repair and he got it working . i used it one more time and it went out again . i took it back and two months later i received a new fryer in the mail . the new one does n't have the digital controls , it 's back to the old fashion dial for temperature setting . if you look on their web site this fryer is no longer there . the one that they sent me is there instead of the dual zone . when the fryer worked , it did a great job , however it did n't work very long . i will be using my new one tonight to fry some fish and french fries . my guess is that it will work as it should , since they got rid of that stupid dual zone control .
1	i just recieved this a few days ago , and it really works great . i purchased this for using with my non-stick cookware , and it works like a dream . i made alfredo sauce , and it thoroughly mixed everything with no problems , and the cheese did n't stick at all . great item , as well as product line..
1	i purchased this in cobalt blue . it goes with my fiestaware dishes , as well as my pzaltsgraf and longerberger pottery . i also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful , and much nicer in person than online . it has a large capacity , and pleasing lines . i 'll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals , to be able to use more than one
1	many of you reading these reviews may be wondering how this compares to similar items made of cast iron . i can tell you that , while it obviously is n't cast iron and for that reason alone many will say it is inferior , it is still an excellent griddle . the bottom is very heavy and it conducts heat well . it fits perfectly over 2 burners on one side of my gas stove . i 've cooked several sandwiches at once on it as well as pancakes and some eggs , and the heat seems to distribute very evenly . i was very impressed with this aspect of the griddle , as cast iron is known for its even heating and i was wondering how an aluminum griddle would hold up ; it definitely does a fine job . the bonus , of course , is the nonstick surface , and it 's a good one , not some chintzy teflon coating . good quality construction . the handles are solid and it does n't feel cheap at all when you hold it . take care of this griddle ( make sure it does n't get scratched ) and it will take care of you
0	i bought this as my second fryer . the third time i used this fryer , the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid would n't close properly and that 's the end of it . prior to buying this fryer , i had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine .
0	this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image ... it broke the second week i had it ... spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor . it 's pure crap . stay away ! !
1	this was a present for my brother who is in culinary arts school . he loves it , and the professor was very impressed with it 's quality . if you 're looking for a quality knife , this is the way to go ! wustoff and henckels are identical except for the stamped handle . get one , you know you want to
1	i really like having this . it 's odor free and easy to use . yes , you have to empty the bags and that takes time , but it 's worth it . i have found refills at walmart , petsmart and petco . so they have n't been hard to find
1	i love the large size of these glasses . its great for swirling your wine . we had a large party and everyone commented on how elegant they looked and how much fun they were to drink from
1	does it look and feel cheap ? yes ! does it do exactly what i expect it to ? ( make coffee automatically at a pre-programmed time in the morning ) yes ! i 've used it to make coffee before i wake up every morning for almost a month , though the design of the pot itself is pretty bad ( i kinda expect it to break or otherwise fail sooner or later ) it 's done the job so far and i ca n't complain .
0	i was impressed with all the pieces , liked the pots with short handles . but , when washing the lids , the handles on top get full of water and have to be sat up for water to drain out ... s l o w l e y , before putting them away . also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you 're cooking . but , what do you want for 30 bucks ?
0	this thing worked like a champ , impressed friends , and lasted all of 6 months ... and then , the plastic screw that attaches the handle to the grating drum snapped . cheap , cheap , cheap ! and at $ 20/per ... definately not considered disposable ! look elsewhere . the zyliss will be my next purchase and i will leave feedback .
0	the handle and pump mechanism for this dispenser are cheesy plastic - they will not last at all . the previous reviewer also pointed out - correctly , that the honey drips out very slowly . not worth the money . they should have used a metal handle and pump and charged a reasonable price for decent quality . not worth your money
0	i purchased four of these shot glasses . of the four , one has tiny bubbles throughout , one has black specs in the glass , one has a bulge in the glass , and the last is taller than the other three . the shape is beautiful , but with all the imperfections , i 'd recommend something else . my most disappointing bodum purchase ever
1	no more water rings - what more could you want ? keeps drinks cold for hours
0	until a week ago , i 'd have given this coffee maker four stars because it has brew-strength control . last week , though , the clock face turned entirely black and this morning the unit completely malfunctioned . the shut off alarm sounded after only an hour but when i went into the kitchen to salvage the last of the coffee , i discovered the unit was still on . draining the pot , i attempted to shut the unit off manually and it kept coming back on . i finally got it shut off and 10 minutes later it turned itself back on again . after unplugging it , the unit went into the trash . i strongly suspect steam was able to get into the mechanism causing the electronics to short circuit . obviously , it is a fatal design flaw -- or a clever ploy to force people to buy more coffee makers . in all , it lasted about eight months
1	these glasses are perfect for keeping drinks colder or warmer and the best part is you do n't feel the temperture on the outside nor do you have condensation from the differences between inside and outside tempeture
0	a couple of days ago i depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread , when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me , thus causing the demise of my applicance . i now realize i paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year
0	i bought these because i was looking for nice red glass . i 'm almost embarrassed at the size of them . they are not practical but i paid so little it was n't worth sending them back . i recently saw them in bloomingdale 's so maybe this is the new trend but they wo n't do anything for your wine .
0	the rubbermaid chrome dish drainer arrived in a timely fashion . however , the utensil holder was not included . i promptly contacted the seller by email . their representative apologized profusely in her response and assured me that the utensil holder would arrive promptly . two weeks later , i did not have a utensil holder and i had received no further communication from the company . i plan to return the item and dispute the charge on my credit card . i also have found the same item under a different brand name for a cheaper price at bed , bath and beyond
1	it is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels : - ) what you probably do n't see on the picture well , it stands on plastic , so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding . has really easy refill-no mess , no fuss , and you can always see when you need to buy pepper . i do n't think there is better pepper grinder out there . others i saw are certainly better looking , artsy , whatever , but this one is the most useful !
1	this product is very well-constructed . it is simple to use and easy to clean . i use it to cook brown rice and dry beans , and it has cut my cooking time down immeasurably . i have only had it a few months so far , and i have not been able to perfect the rice ( there always seems to be too much water left at the end ) , but i will keep reducing the amount of water until i have the perfect mix . i would highly recommend this pressure cooker to anyone , beginning cooks or seasoned culinary experts . i 'll certainly be sending one down to south carolina for mothers day
1	very well made . a quality item . works just as described in booklet
1	these are great knives , especially for the price . they are just like the pro-s line from henckels only are not hardened the same way . they are sharp . the chefs knife sliced a very ripe tomato straight out of the box . they have excellent weight and balance and the handles are comfortable . all in all , a great buy ! i ca n't believe i used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible . definitely worth their weight in gold
0	we had a rude awaking today , our delonghi toaster was on fire . i will never again buy any delonghi product . the defective design is in the toast switch . it is mechanical . when it finishes toasting , it sometimes continues to the `` always on '' position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast : very , very hot . we literally had a house full of smoke a toaster full of flames . you were warned . funny thing is , delonghi makes an attractive product . sad thing is , they can cost you your house or worse
1	i bought two of these , one blue and one yellow and they 're beautiful . there is no way you could buy this fabric alone for this price . it is not fitted -- as one can see in the picture . it covers my hefty futon couch very nicely and i 'm completely pleased with this product . i do recommend it
1	cal king sheets , etc are extremely difficult to get in the stores outside of california ... . this was just what i saw in mervyn 's in la ... . a couple dollars less than retail . arrived promptly . washed it as soon as i got it and no shrinkage . such a dea
0	one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way , but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier . especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup . i 'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum , and then follow with a functional , well-designed good mop ( like the old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better as seperate units , which is why there 's no washing machine that 's also a dryer . the flip-it is a very loud machine -- so loud , that i did n't hear my phone ring in the same room . this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children , too . it 's difficult to push and feels like it 's gripping to the floor . it does n't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it 's big fat part-vacuum head . and , when you 're finished , it 's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter ( which you 're supposed to keep dry somehow ) so you can look forward to a second job once you 've finished the job of cleaning your floors . and , because of the `` flip it '' back and forth design , the thing has no equilibrium ... it fell to the floor at least 3 times , even when i was so careful to rest it against something ... once when this happened , the `` dirty water '' recovery tank hit the floor , fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . a true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my bissell steammop , and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try , but , sadly , i was disappointed . i do n't review things often , but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean . this contraption is not your answer . on a side note , i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop ( what an excellent product ) , so i 'm hoping that they will one day
1	excellent item , very powerful and stylish . would recommend this mixer to anyone that likes to bake and has trouble with power from hand held mixers
1	we have an aussie/healer mix ( we think ... she was a foundling ) with a thick , soft coat . i 've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at $ 60 to $ 75 a pop so last summer i decided to try it myself with this clipper kit . to make a long story short , she did n't turn out so bad ! ( well , the neighbors did n't laugh , anyway ! ) it took me a while to get the hang of it -- i finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers -- but she did n't complain and i had a `` cool '' dog for much less $ $ $ than a pro cut . the best part was i could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back . no report as yet how long the blades last , but i 'm already money ahead even if i must replace them next year
1	i really like these glasses . the glass really does make a difference -- sometimes . i 'll probably next purchase their `` red '' glasses
1	this sheet is great . feels great , looks great , and feels good to the skin . glad i bought it and the price was great
1	i really love the litter locker . the price ca n't be beat at amazon so get them here for sure . most pet stores will charge you twice that
0	checked online comparing many models and purchased one two years ago , worked great all winter . decided to purchase a second last year year , both worked great all winter last year . unfortunatly this year neither works , despite cleaning and following all instructions . guess the quality is put into them just enough to last though the warranty period . junk , dont buy .
0	we bought four sets of the victoria collection 600 thread count queen size . the fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed . it seems like that were made for a full size not queen size ... list this as a reject . we are very very disappointed
1	great item , just what i needed . the price was fine and the company reputation was a serious consideration in my selection
0	i should have paid more attention to the reviews ... i was warned ahead of time that this crate should n't be used as an everyday or long-term solution . we 've been using the crate for less than three months and already the zipper one one end ( that we use all the time ) is screwed up and half the time it does n't open . at least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out , but i 'm afraid of the morning when i try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck . ( we leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in . when she gets a little older , we will leave her in her crate all day . ) we could still use the zippers on the top , but we do n't like those since the dog ca n't get in and out at her leisure . although in general it 's a nice crate , i probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers -- hence the two stars . i am completely surprised that we only got three months ' use out of it before the zippers bit the dust . we 've already purchased a different , sturdier , latch-style crate that we 're much happier with ... and we should have bought to start with
1	i need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price plus 6 napkins . both packets arrived dirty with many hanging threads and i threw them straight into the washer . they are 55 % cotton and 45 % polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free . i am very happy with these basic table linens . i like the price too . made in pakista
1	to go with my original finish lodge cookware , but this one did n't take any effort to season . good going , lodge
0	i agree with a previous review , coating does not hold up . comes off if bumped to hard.has been used gently and the metal is already showing . one thing i would like to know is , what is the highest temp this coating will tolerate
1	i have no kitchen stove so i have been relying on this little champ for everything from tea to pasta ( before south beach diet ) to making eggs in the morning , etc . i have owned this unit for over 3 years and have never once had a problem with it . awesome for a college student or a person with a tiny apartment such as mine . also great for taking to work . it is a bit hard to clean and there is not too much area to touch to move it while it is still cooling down . other than that , i highly recommend it . i am here today to buy the double version and i can only hope that it performs as well as it 's little sister . enjoy ! ! ! - li
1	i purchased this for a betta fish , which was a gift for my cats . this model was perfect because the lid screws on , which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish . there is a small hole at the top , so you do n't have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish . the `` aqua gems '' cover the bottom , but i added some gravel for additional covering . also , the aqua gems are light , and you lose some when changing the water , so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually . the one negative i found is that the light is basically useless . it illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly . other than that , i 'm very satisfied . i did look at petsmart for additional oxygen stones , but they do n't sell them . not sure if those are really necessary , though
0	i bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker..i could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it.. , rather than 2 ... however , i used it exactly 5 days , and then it died ... granted , the econonical price was a factor when i purchased it , but i really expected it to last more than 5 days..unfortunately , it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed , so i was forced to throw it away ... lesson learned ; some things are just not a bargain.. ! !
1	i got excited about 5min after opening the box ... most people laugh at the idea , but this thing is perfect for me ... i live in a decent sized apartment and always have unexpected guests ... all i did was set the schedule to to the thing on twice a week while at work ... lets see how that runs ... just for fun , as soon as i got it , i plugged thehomebase charger in , took the roomba to the opposite end of my apartment in another room ... pushed the `` find home '' buttons and within 5 min , it was charging it self ... . right now i have it running around the apt just to watch it.. its entertaining , circling around chair legs before its done going under furniture , stopping at lint and going over it again it till it gets picked up ... i dont know what to say ... ive had the thing for 5 hours , and im loving it ... whenever it goes over wires , it backs up and tries something else ... and the thing sounds like a remote control car ... maybe not even that loud ... i was expecting it to sound like a full blown vacumm.. not the case at all ... . just as a test i put a very thin cord about 6 inches long in its path to see what would happen ... the thing tries everything to get it from being stuck , then if it cant get it out.. it stops and makes little `` game over '' type sound effects ... this thing is good ... anyone who sees what its doing to my apt will wind up getting it . i will update this if anything changes . hope you get the same results
1	my husband and i fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza . a tombstone pizza fits great on this plate
0	order the wok and got it damaged ( off-shaped ) . the packaging is horrible . basiclly they put the bare wok in the box filled with the giant air bubbles . the wok can move around freely in the box . guess the damage is caused during shipping . return and reordered the typhoon carbon steel wok , similar size and design , $ 3 cheaper . when i got it , i am very pleased with the quality : * ) properly packaged , plastic cover on the top , sheet of paper on the bottom ; fitted in a box designed for it ; * ) thick steel : 2.5mm rather than 1.8mm from joyce chen ; * ) handles are welded on the wok , so no dead spot when cleaning ; * ) seasoning instruction are well documented , in 8 different languages , even thou i use my own seasoning way , not like joyce chen 's one thin sheet of paper with not so clear instruction . overall , joyce chen 's wok is like the one you can get from chinatown supermarket , and typhoon one is like from macy 's
0	i bought this particular lever corkscrew because i read a very favorable review in consumer reports . it is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears , the guide and the frame . after about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use . i actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point . end of story .
1	just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket . it is rice we have prepared numerous times in another ( cheaper ) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop . the rice that came out of the zojirushi was absolutely perfect ! as good as any i have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to china . i was astounded . none of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker , just perfect plump , fragrant rice . the countertop stayed clean as well , did n't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker . clean up of the cooker was easy . top notch , excellent product . you ca n't make better rice than what this thing produces
1	works great . i purchase 3 , one for my husband and 2 more for my children . good design . however , it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry , an ipod and a gameboy . the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time
0	the original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms . this replacement filter , however , does not seem to wick water very well . it can barely keep a 17x12 ' room at 30 % humidity with the door closed , windows shut and heat turned off . and it 's in the 40s -- not even very cold out . in fact , it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank i have to flip the filter every hour or so . i called hamilton beach but they said it was n't their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3m . of course , this is the only filter offered for use with this unit
0	i 've had my futon a little over two months and was very happy with it initially until one day two of the wooden slats which are all held in place with plastic fell apart ( and i only weigh 100lbs ) . i tried everything to fix the problem to no avail . so considering it only lasted a few months , it really is not worth the money at all . the price is cheap but so is the quality . for what it will cost me to replace this one , i could 've bought a much better quality futon without the disappointment and aggravation
0	this unit can only dry half of what it can wash , which is not that much . it takes a total of 4 1/2 hours to do one load of laundry if you only put 11lbs of wash in . i have a family of five and i am over-run with laudry because of this machine ! !
0	i wish i had read the customer reviews before purchasing this . my wife just tried to use our kitchenaide egg slicer for the first time and two of the wires snapped as she tried to slice up some strawberries . do not purchase this egg slicer ! it is a waste of $ 10
1	i bought this for my husband 's birthday b/c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there . carafes that leak , coffeemakers that do n't keep the right temperature , etc ... this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5-star restaurant . in fact , they probably use a bunn . the design is utilitarian-not decoration , and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee
1	we bought one for my home office , and my largest cat loved it but could n't fully fit on it ( he likes to stretch out when he sleeps ) . he was doing whatever he could to make it work . so then we bought a second one to put right next to the first , and his reaction was one of pure love and ecstasy . one cat can get on each , although the largest will share space from the other . ( we have no small cats ) but since we have three cats , and sometimes petsit a fourth , that area gets crowded sometimes , and there are hissing fights . i do n't have quite enough window space for a third . right now i 'm looking for replaceable covers , and i 'm not having much luck . we 've had these for a few years , and try to keep them cleaned , but it 's a pain . we need to replace them
0	the humidifier started leaking after a few weeks . in another website , a few reviewers also had this problem . the water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty . very annoying ! ! the filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use . it is also way too expensive
1	product arrived promptly , in good condition ! this product costs twice as much at vets office . somebodies making money ! ! !
0	as a starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college ... i know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks . my roommates got this for me as a christmas present at the field days sale so i could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions . after about 2 months of use ... the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead . i contacted a service advisor at krups ' website and it turns out that i would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in illinois on my own dime . no thank you ! i 'll find something better
0	do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe . the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe . the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over . nice work guys . one call to their customer service line was cut off . on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back -- unfortunately the mailbox was full . i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service
0	i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more , francis francis being my first . this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as `` espresso '' machines but marginally . if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important . focusing on the machine for a moment . you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee . a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste . this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans . the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste . if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra . you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results . the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed
1	i planted these last wed . it is now tues and i think by tommorow i will be able to harvest . they grow so fast you ca n't believe it . when i wake up they look like they have grown so much , by the time i go to bed they are even bigger ! ! it was very easy to plant and all i do is make sure they have water . there is a chance you can get mold , but i have not had that problem . i will buy more from this seller ! i am looking into the mushroom kits
1	the distribution of heat in this pan is super ! great for gravies and sauces . i have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking . stir frying can reduce fats and is usually a pretty healthy way to eat a wide variety of veggies and other delightful ingredients . i even use it to pop brown rice or basmati rice . ever tried hot puffed rice ? sometimes i eat it just like pop corn but often just for a different way of serving rice . this pan is deep enough with or without the lid to keep it from popping out of the pan ( depending how much you start with ) . it is also useful to cook or finish foods in the oven up to 500 degrees . and it is kitchenaid . i expect it to outlast me
0	after i cracked and ruined my original filter , i purchased a new one that insisted the biomax inserts were essential to its functionality . having had my original filter for about 6 years , i decided to follow the instructions about adding biomax , thinking this was a product upgrade . i was deeply dissapointed . not only did it create cloudy water , despite my effort to add `` clear water '' drops to resolve this , but the lifespan of my fish decreased dramatically . i was losing fish every week . once i removed the biomax insert , the water cleared instantly and my fish started to thrive
1	this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up . i use mine constantly , and did n't think i would when i bought it . we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own . i love my fiestaware , you ca n't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes
0	i have to admit that i love this set . especially since i found it hard to find white flannel sheets . most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen ! so when i found these and at this price i was quite happy . they feel great , not the best flannel but nice all the same . but after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore . later the fitted started getting holes . so since this was rather cheap i am not horribly sad about it . so if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning , this is the set for you
0	i usually like oxo products , but this one is a real loser . not only does it not give accurate readings ( which in itself should deem it useless , being that it is a thermometer after all ) but there are other features that further enhance its horrible design . first of all , the `` handy '' ( so they claim ) spin dial that allows you to set the temperature that you want to reach , is so flimsy that the slightest movement of the thermometer throws the dial off . useless . secondly , after only one handwashing , water seeped under the dial face which is impossible to get out . the water then turns to steam which fogs up the display so you ca n't even read its inaccurate readings . 2 weeks later there is still steam under the dial . useless again . and to pour salt on my already stinging wound , i had emailed oxo to inquire about how to return this item and get a refund weeks ago , but they have yet to respond to me , even though on the package it states that satisfaction is 100 percent guaranteed . well , i am not a satisfied customer and if my second attempt to reach them proves fruitless once again , then i doubt i will ever purchase another oxo product again , no matter how good they are . it pains me to even give this product one star , as a product that 's utterly useless deserves no star at all . oxo should be ashamed of themselves . thanks for allowing me to vent my 2 cents
1	this is wonderful . the best laundry basket ever used
0	this flan pan is very flimsy , and do n't hold up well
1	the flutes are absolutely great ! exactly what i wanted and even better than expected . i will be purchasing more of these shortly
0	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell , i have 3 dogs , i put it on and they went beserk , they started going after each other , i did n't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure the dogs did , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , the tone must have made them lash out like that . i can not use it anymore .
1	rarely does a product move me to write a review but i have found myself increasingly using the net ( and amazon ) to review products i am not really familiar with before buying them . rice cookers were one of those products . so i thought i 'd share my experience since i had a hard time finding a review for this rice cooker to help others out . we were microwave rice and stovetop rice cookers until we started eating a lot of sushi . then we wanted something to make the `` perfect rice '' . this is it . the first time we used it , i let my girlfriend make the rice . it boiled over and made a huge mess and came out totally mushy . i was bummed i spent $ 200 on a rice cooker that was going to be messy or difficult to use . then , i watched my girlfriend making it the second time and realized she was putting in 2 times the amount of water required . following the directions , the 25 or 30 times we have used it since , we get absolutely perfect rice . white rice , sticky rice , whatever . it is sylish so it does n't look like a little crock pot sitting in my contemporary kitchen , the cord retracts into the base for convenience and the thing could n't be easier to clean . the rice pot , the lid and the steam vent pop out and are easily cleaned . wipe the rest down with a damp paper towel and you 're done . so easy . rarely is `` set it and forget it '' associated with perfection , but in this case it is . would i prefer if it was $ 100- $ 150 , sure . but i paid $ 200 and do n't regret it .
1	this works great on tile grout ! it would be nice if it worked good on the glass shower doors but it did n't not bad for the price . it does take a long time to get the job done .
1	i really like this kitchen gadget as it different , actually useful , and my hands smell less like garlic . thus far , i have only used it to chop herbs , onions , and garlic so i ca n't debunk the mush mess . i would simply say , do n't pull the cord a lot if you 're worried about it . i bought about 5 and gave them all out as x-mas gifts
1	my mother had a set of franciscan apple dinnerware as i was growing up , though i never thought too much about what i was eating off of at the time . later , as a wife and mother myself , i was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen . we had just moved to appleton , wi ( 16 years ago ) so i decided to use an apple theme , w/o even connecting the idea with my mom 's dishes . i was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the franciscan dishes . over the years i 've collected innumerable apple items , but my goal is to have a set of franciscan apple dishes of my own ! they do chip , but they last forever and retain their color beautifully
1	love this silicone oven mitt . i have had no issues with heat conductivity and it is extremely resistant to stains . also love the magnet that allows for refrigerator hanging . all in all , just a great item that i use all the time . great colors , too
1	the stool is excellent quality - looks good and works well . the surprise is the weight - very heavy
0	while the pan handle stays cool , the lid handle heats up with the pan . you need a pot holder to use the cover . i did n't like that .
1	i bought these molds for my crystal light drinks so that i could have a more nutritious dessert option . the molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money . the plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable . make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom , impossible to get back out , and the taste will go with it . i have fun using these and they were reasonably priced
0	i bought this and used it once . right from the begining i could tell this was a shotty product . i do n't know who designed the wringing fuction but it does n't work in the least . and the removeable cleaning head would not stay attached half the time and i assure you it was inserted correctly . waste of money ! !
0	i bought a blue one . the mug looks nice enough , but it cracked the first time i filled it with hot water for tea . get your act together guys -- it really is not so difficult to make dishes that can withstand a little heat . as for the claim that this can go in the microwave ... after the mug cracked , i did n't bother to try
0	the vacuum has great suction . however , suction is the only good quality about this vacuum . i purchased this vacuum at sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale . but i have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one . the 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter , the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break . the 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off . this vacuum is hard to push . you have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting . on hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too ! this vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections . the small compartment in the back of the dust cup is ( 1 '' high x 5 '' wide x 6 '' deep ) for the dirt . the large front section collects the hair , crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home , however dirt and fine particulate dust is what i collect in my vacuum , and hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter . you spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet . today i had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter . even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out . yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up . i have tried kenmore , eureka , and fantom in the past . i plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once i get my dyson i purchased from hsn
1	we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years . they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine . i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below , but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together , not just by the handle . fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand . ( they are made like hotel china , essentially . homer laughlin is a hotel china company , in fact . the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line . ) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style , i can recommend the fiestaware `` jumbo cups . '' we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee , but also for heating soup in the microwave . they are both great . never been disappointed with fiestaware
0	i was excited about getting a cute timer that worked with the decor of my kitchen . unfortunately , the timer never worked on the product ! now i am sad
1	thest waterford flutes are absolutely beautiful . i know that some may think they are a little pricey , but its worth it . they make a great bride/groom flute glass for the wedding reception . also , its a great remembrance of your day ! they are so cute
1	i love this carafe - it is perfect for making flavored water with sliced lemons , limes oranges . the narrow neck means that the fruit wo n't fall into your glass while you are pouring and the fruit staying put also means it can steep in the water longer ... yu
0	well , i have a toy poodle , and he goes crazy when he hears someone at our door . we live in a tiny studio in nyc , so if he hears someone going into their apt in the middle of the night , he goes crazy and wakes everyone up . after a lack of sleep and total frustration i got this collar . it work until one night i woke up to horrible noises when i saw that my dog had attempted to slip the collar off , and because of all his fur the collar was able to slide partially off but not all the way , leaving the electric part in his mouth , and when he whined , it electrocuted his mouth ... .so i quick unhooked it and couldnt stop freaking out ... so my boyfriend said that its not a bad shock , its just a quick pinched ... so i tryed it on my neck , and my god , was it powerful , it burned and paralyzed your whole area . i made my boyfriend try it to just so he couldnt say i was being a p*ssy . we threw it right out after that . i didnt even want to resell it or get my money back , because i would feel too guilty giving it to anyone else . my suggestion is that you get just a sound correction device , with no electric correction , because i learned first hand its really not humane . or a spray collar that shoots out a spray of citranella or something .
1	we have owned other hoover steam cleaners . they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking . we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet . we bought the hoover f5914-900 based on the reviews . i was confident that it would n't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america . i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together . we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack . i could n't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job . ok ... our hoover came . my husband put it together and it leaked all over . i then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them . by then we had already taken it to the repair center . after a week they had not touched it . my husband picked the machine up and brought it home . we decided to start from square one and put it together again . he did , following the directions to the letter . lo and behold ... no leaks ! ! ! ! ! yeah ! my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman . so ... the moral to this story is always read the directions first
0	i purchased two units -- one for our home and one for our vacation home . within a few days , the unit at home was no longer making good crema . the water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses . i 'm sending both units back and buying another brand . if they had worked properly , i 'm not sure i would have like them even then . the design of this unit is `` odd '' . i 've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird . if you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew , the grounds and steam explode all over . i also suspect that the thermostat is broken . it allows the water to boil -- which does not make tasty coffee . overall , i hate this unit . i 'm going back to shopping
1	sango stoneware has been great for us for everyday use . good feel with smooth surfaces including the bottom so it does n't scratch . i 've built up a whole collection of sango gold dust after seeing it at bed bath and beyond . pick up items on sale , no need to pay regular price . this set is a great addition to a more complete collection
1	after spending $ 5- $ 10 a day at starbucks , my wife and i got the jura-capresso for the convenience of a fully automatic machine and having fresh latte 's at home in the morning . we have used it for over 3 months now , and like it more and more each week . the espresso , latte 's , and cappucino 's are wonderful , having to touch one button to have everything done at once is so easy , but perhaps the best part is the self cleaning it does . about once a week you clean out a tray and refill the water ... that 's pretty much it ! desserts like affogato ( espresso on top of ice cream ) are a just too easy to make now ! downsides : -if you ever plan to reduce your caffeine consumption , this machine is not for you . my wife and i both drink more coffee now because it is so good and so convenient . -if you like really hot latte 's the steamed milk wo n't get hot enough . i 'd call it very warm or slightly hot . just right for drinking but by the end it can be kind of cool . warm up the glass with the hot water option before fixes the problem . espresso , coffee , and even cappucino 's come out at a perfect temperature
0	i bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box . first , the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy , and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back . there was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance . finally , it is just not good looking at all ... extremely cheap in appearance . it did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to amazon . i went with the bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers . evidently , another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances . do not buy this item ! ! ! ! get the braun kf550-bk aromadeluxe instead
1	i bought this set after the recent issues with teflon . i did my research on all non-teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may ( key word here is may ) contribute to alzheimer 's ( according to some ) , and the stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods , both of which i am allergic too . pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive ; a good set of a few items are $ 600+ . there are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by corning/pyrex called visionware ( also known as visions ) that can be found on ebay ( and a few are left here on amazon ) as they are no longer in production . finally , there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternatives the items have been great so far , however , you will really want to do some research in google ( or any other search engine ) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really should n't do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water ( it will crack or break ) etc . in addition , you will also want to so some research on how to `` season '' them which makes them very close to being non-stick ( you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and `` bake '' the pans for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit ) . i did this and i just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick teflon pan , but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan . the downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you can not stick the pan into the dishwasher ( and i tried ... .it will come out a little bit rustier-but the little rust does come off very easily ) . the sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me . so i think i will buy one more in a larger size . the upsides are price , no chemicals ( except for some iron ) in your food , easy to care for , and very non stick when seasoned . this is a great starter set
1	i do most of the vacuuming . my wife 's only request when i went looking for a new model was that it use a bag . she absolutely hates the bagless models and does n't want to see what we 're pulling up . we have two dogs ( an akita and a golden retriever ) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day . so after searching i find this model . i researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me i take the plunge and order it from amazon . now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and i was shocked when it arrived in 4 . the big thing i like about this unit is that the bags it uses ( although a little hard to find ) have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt . the unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well . and boy does it clean ! our rugs look fantastic ! one complaint i have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off . another would be that you can not turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position..i know its a safety feature..i just do n't like it . the pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades . the little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas . overall i would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from amazon was so positive that i 've purchased other items and make it my first place to look now
0	to us , typical fiestaware pieces have great design , color , durability and functioning wrapped up all-in-one . we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with straight candle results . even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product . specifically , the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles . we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better . we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations . fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform , a kind of softer look in the color application around the rims on plates , for example , and the piece will still look beautiful . we do n't want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces
0	product worked well for several months - providing sufficient heating for moderate-sized space . however , heater now only provides heat for approximately 1-2 minutes after turning on , then *sparks* and the heating mechanism fails . dangerous for a space heater , no
0	usually break free product but smashed in amazon delivery and then had to wait 4 weeks for credit . boo
1	i love it ! my kids and i had it open 10 minutes and ordered another one for my mom ! !
0	ive had this vacumn for about 2 years . after about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way . still has very good power . bad news , it doesnt move around easy . it is like dragging an old tire around , hard to turn and direct , canister always rolls over . the only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt , and dont vacumn that often , i guess because i dread using it . i am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while . but still like i said , lots of power if you keep the filter clean
1	these tables are great . i bought two of them . solid wood , classic design that will still look good in 10 years , and easy no fuss assembly . all this at a great price . pick one up
1	i like this style of salad spinner . when i ordered it , though , i did n't realize that it is as small as it is . it would be adequate for one person who does n't chow down on salad all day . i recomend the product if you do n't have much salad to spin
1	i am very satisfied with my purchase . the quality is as described and i will buy more !
1	i have several oxo spatulas - they do n't warp , bend , peel , discolor or melt - even if used to stir things in a hot pan . so far , none of them have broken , and i have had several of them for a few years . great quality
0	unfortunately , i ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead . this was *not* amazon 's fault , but emile henry 's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not . in fairness to amazon , they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled . althought i would have preferred the oval bakers , i kept the rectangular ones and do like them
1	excellant co. to deal with . we had a few questions and they were answered immediately and there was a mailing problem and this co. did everything correct and fast . we highly reccommend this co
0	i found it very awkward trying to stabilize the pump with one hand , and pull the pump up and down to get the air out . also i can not get the top out of the decanter . it seems stuck there . as a result , i can not say if it does what you claim
1	bought this opener because i was tired of trying to open tall cans with an average size electric opener.not only does it open cans that are taller , but it does it with ease . locks on can top , stays on through entire cycle . my last opener would often get half way through the can and miss spot before juming off track . not this one ! i am very pleased
1	i received this coffeemaker as a christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket-style filter . after using the maker for a week , i have to say my skepticism was unjustified . this machine makes great-tasting coffee that is as hot as i could want it . i never liked the `` cooked '' coffee that regular , glass-carafe makers produced - burned tasting after the first cup . the coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last . i fill the carafe with hot water , mill my beans and fill the reservoir , empty the carafe and enjoy . after two hours , the coffee was still hot . one great feature not highlighted is the front-fill aspect : kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front , right next to the filter . no more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level . extremely convenient . i have to disagree with the previous reviewer - this machine makes ten 5-ounce cups . after reading the review , i double-checked the carafe capacity against my old krups machine : exactly 10 cups ; more than enough for our household . all in all , a great-looking , great-performing coffeemaker that meets kitchenaid 's high standards . i highly recommend it
1	i bought this heater to head my bedroom/finished basement . the room is 16'x21 ' with 9 food ceilings . the heater does a fantastic job at heating the room , though takes a while ( ~1 hour ) to do so ... . which is fine with me . i really like the fact that it is dead quiet and has a convienent lcd timer . my only complaint is that it is rather large/long
0	this item is not nine inches wide . it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan , but costs ten dollars more . so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size . hopefully , the item description will be changed soon . now , i have to pack up and ship back several of these , but at least amazon is paying the freight . lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though . i think this is just a random error . just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7.99 . the cornsticks will be the same size
1	the krups xp 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now , with no problems to speak of . we use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily , and each time it has been very good . a notice i would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided . the provided tamper is plastic , and can be wobbly , but i am very satisfied with the product
1	we use this to serve ice water at meals . it is so beautiful . it holds a full 2 qts . not much else to say about it . it is a water pitcher after all . it is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table . we have two , one for each end of the table
1	after reading every review on deep fryers i could find , i finally decided on this one . it has been great and i could n't ask for anything better or more easy to use . i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors . it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great . we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish , so this was greatly appreciated . cleanup is easy also . after waiting for the oil to cool , the pan , lid and rack can go into the dishwasher . only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy . the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be . i would recommend this with no caveats
0	i bought this product on my mom 's suggestion , because she was impressed with the suction power . not only did the suction power fade over the first few months of ownership , but within 6 months the vacuum was completely broken . i called in to customer service because it was still under warranty , and they were anything but helpful . they sent me to a small shop 45 minutes away to have it fixed , which took over a month . they even lost my paperwork . one month later it broke again , and customer service suggested i take it out in my backyard , take the vacuum apart , and blow the small holes with an air compressor to clean it out . for $ 400 , this is ridiculous . i want my $ 100 vacuum back
1	product works well but , i wish it moved greater volume of air . runs 24/7 since oct. 30
0	i loved it until it broke after using it for a day . now when i turn it on the sound will not turn off . if it actually worked correctly i think i would have given it a better rating
1	easy to use and easy to clean and storem look online for jerky recipie
0	it amazes me that this model is being sold here , since the product was recalled by the manufacturer . a newer , safer model is offered for just $ 10 more by vornado . do your homework before you buy ...
1	this is our first juicer and we are have a great time juicing everything . we use it a lot with our smoothie maker . it is designed well and is very easy to clean . it does drip a bit for a while from the spout but that is n't a problem at all . we got this because we have a 2 year old and a 16 year old . we wanted to make it easy to give them great tasting sweets that are good for them . my 16 year old son loves apple juice and makes it all the time now -- no more soda in our house !
0	the can opener does not swing tight and once installed , kept swinging out instead of staying stowed . i bought it because it was so highly rated , but i am very disappointed . there is no magnet to hold the can lid either . although it was intended to save space , it is kind of a clunky eyesore
0	the heater works fine , but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet . delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period . i will not buy an oil-filled heater again
0	i also had a problem with the coating flaking off ... within the first week of using it . the only reason i still use it is because i 'm a poor college student that got it as a gift in the first place and ca n't afford a new one . after scrubbing the inside bottom of the wok furiously , i managed to get all the flakes off and then some . the lid is made of thin aluminum and has bent almost completely out of shape . awful product . do not buy this wok
0	we ordered one of these racks and it was ok. then we ordered another one and one of the pieces was bent making it impossible to contruct . target replaced it and the replacement was similarly defective- not worth the hassle of going back and forth to the post office
0	wow , what a fine example of terrible engineering . the only control is a knob that ranges from off to super . to set the thermostat , you turn the knob to the super setting . when the room reaches a comfortable level , you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off . this is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp . at this setting , the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp . this design sets the stage for a frustrating user experience : - by design , you must turn the thermostat to the highest setting , then wait for the room to heat up before fiddling with the knob until the unit clicks off , at which point you end up turning it up a bit until it clicks on ( if it does ) . its like trying to adjust your home 's thermostat in the dark ... just show me where to set the dial for 68 degrees and let me get on with my day . - when the heater is working as designed , it turns on for 30-60 seconds , turns off for 10-90 seconds , then repeats the cycle relentlessly and unpredictably until you unplug it , let it cool , box it back up , and send it back . i want a refund , reimbursement for lost productivity , and an ice cream sandwich .
1	i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty . these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day . while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine , they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used ( and washed ! ) on a regular basis . if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience , give these a try
0	this burner is driving me nuts . it was okay for the first 2 weeks , took forever to heat up but it would boil water . well i am trying to make pasta now , and it wo n't even boil the water . i would never by another toastmaster product
1	i love this - had seen items like it and so broke down . now i am sorry i have not had one for years and year
1	i received my mogu about 5 months ago and i 've gone to sleep holding it ever since ! they really are nice to hold . would reccomend 100 %
0	the packaging had n't been so pathetic . the tiny pieces of styrofoam , that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping , led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant . the cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame , and one of the pipes was broken and leaking . plus there was no crisper drawer included . i wo n't be buying a replacement from sanyo ! !
0	too expensive , too little heat , unit quit after a year of intermittent use - i wo n't buy vornado again .
0	my mother-in-law and i both had this blender . hers broke in a couple of months . i was lucky that mine lasted a couple of years . it is a great blender for crushing ice for smoothies/icees , etc. , however it has a flaw that the piece that the pitcher sits on when it spins is made out of plastic . it eventually cracks from the heat/friction produced . i bought the oster beehive blender to replace it , and it has a metal piece beneath it and i have had it for a few years now with no problem . i am even happier with the oster beehive blender , as it is a much better quality blender which will last a lot longer than the cuisinart one ( it was also cheaper ) , and it crushes ice exactly as good if not better than the cuisinart blender
0	i received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so i called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc . i have since returned both pads in the same box
1	this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy . it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before . it also heats very evenly . the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon . however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem
0	this wok is heavy and unbalanced - it can tip while on the element . the long handle is thick and uncomfortable , and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok . lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task . the flat bottom is n't wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir-frying . if i wanted to sauté , i 'd have gotten a sauté pan . the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere . you need lots of counter space . as well , this wok just is n't large enough for stir-frying for more than two people
0	from the description , i thought these would be a lot more sturdy . they 're fine for storing light weight items that you do n't need to access often . but i found that the plastic supports tended to break through the fabric at the corners and break in half if stressed
0	do not be tricked into buying an `` easy '' sharpener . they do not work . spend the same money ( or less ! ) on a good stone set that has various angles ( i.e . lansky , w/ 17 , 20 , 25 , and 30 degree angles , and 3-5 stones : use 20 degrees for your `` slicing '' and paring knives , and 25 degrees for you chefs ) . i opted for the stone set ( i 'm a bit of a purist ) , but i 've heard good remarks about the diamond set , too ; the 3 grit set is all you really need : coarse , medium , and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such . with proper care , and light steel use ( it 's the re-aligning tool , not the sharpening device - be gentle ) , you 'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two , depending on the work load you put on your knife . but , if you do seriously muck the edge up , you 'll have a system that can repair your knife to `` good as new '' condition . my chef fell onto the tile floor , point first , and i had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later . the normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade . and , at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened , you 'll be ahead of the game after the first use ! hint : use a 5x+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source , you 'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened . you can also take a look at your edge before using the steel , and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it , then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel . and , see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - i admit i have a couple , myself . in short : get stoned , not taken
0	we ordered an 8 inch quiche pan . when it arrived , the nordic 8 inch pan turned out to be 9 inches . a 9 inch quiche pan can be bought at any local store . i went on line to find a hard-to-locate item . and when i ordered this item it was not in stock so i waited almost a month for delivery and it is not as described i was deceived by the web advertisement . unfortunately , amazon hides the merchants name in the billing arrangement so i can not review the merchant
1	this is a very nice piece of furniture . well built , good quality . it was shipped via ups and the box was quite damaged when it arrived . thank goodness for good packaging , or it would have been destroyed . one of the doors did have a crack in it and a new door is to be shippped shortly . a new mode of shipping should be considered .
1	the spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove . the food does not fall through the slots . it is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying . it is good for dipping out food out of dishes also . the only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when i received it . it did n't hurt the function of the spatula . it is a great tool to have in the kitchen
1	i 've had the grind and brew for almost 3 years , and have never had any problems . it makes great coffee , it 's not that hard to clean , and it has adjustable settings for temperature and coffee strength , so if you fiddle with it a little , you can get it to make exactly the coffee you want . i gave one to my cousin a couple of years ago as well , and it turned him into a total coffee addict .
1	my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old . over the years we have tried allergy shots , dietary changes , and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune . we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic . her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment . the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application , and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears , i can keep her clear . this stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges , i 'm happy to keep it on hand
0	i purchased this book because i have a lot of bundt pans . i was disappointed to see almost half the recipes involved a box cake . i buy cook books to make things home made not via boxed cake mixes . it basicially told you to buy a box of cake mix and add this and that to it . who ca n't do that themselves ? not a good cookbook at all . if you want lessons on how to make boxed cakes than you 'll like this box . i make all my cakes homemade so this book was useless to me
1	this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well . the fan is very quiet . i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well . my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright . too bright for a bedroom . really lights it up . i 'll be looking for some way of safely masking it . otherwise very nice but hope it lasts
1	i got this for my mother and i was n't too sure about the color i had originally wanted a darker color- but this arrived and was such an excellent product ... my mother loves and when i seen it on her bed it made me want one - this is one of the best deals i have gotten on amazon .. love it
0	i have used one crock pot or another for many years . i bought this one because i was delighted with the sturdy removable stoneware bowl ; i really like this feature . clean-up is easy . i use this crock pot for soups and beans because it cooks way too hot for anything else . even so , i need to stir from time to time . apparently , excessive temperature is the problem most people are having with this pot . this might be a safety issue ; i would not keep this pot on and leave the house . i am disappointed that the handle has broken off of the lid , which really should not happen with normal use . i lifted the lid , to stir of course , and off came the handle ! lifting the lid is definately normal use !
1	after reading reviews on the wok 's available on amazon [ .com ] , i decided on this wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher . turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher , but it is very easy to hand clean . the non-stick surface has lasted , but i am careful to only use plasic or wood , and i wash it with a cloth and soap . it gets to temperature quickly during cooking , the only 'complaint ' i have is the simmer cycles ( not a constant heat , but on and off ) . i purchased some thai cook books , ( real thai , and thailand the beautiful cook book ) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a wok , how easy it is to prepare my favorite food . the difference the wok made- i was able to cook at the correct temperatures . my stove btu is apparently quite low , it took forever to 'sizzle ' so the food turned to mush before it was cooked . i now use the wok for anything i want to cook fast and/or warm up
0	the quality of the workmanship is awful ! i did n't even get to use it - the top had chips in it and the bottom of the pestle had a huge crack that looks like it happened during the firing process
0	i have loved every le creuset product i have purchased with the big exception of the whistling teakettle ! i did away with it a couple of months ago and bought the brittany model to replace it . the whistling kettle burned my hand on several occasions , as the design of the spout allowed the hot water to spit and jump right out of the pot ! the whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring . even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat , the water would still jump from the spout . while a little larger than i would have liked , the brittany does not have the same problem and the whistle can be safely flipped up before pouring . i have been very pleased with my new kettle and would recommend the brittany by far over the whistling
1	i 've already reviewed the miele vacuum cleaner itself , along with the turbo brush , so i 'm a fan of the pricy-but-worth-it-if-you-can-afford-it sucker . if you 're reading this , you 're probably one too , so i 'm not gon na talk about the vacuum cleaner on a net page selling the bags . i 'm just going to relate information on the box about what miele vacuums this goes with , on the theory that 's the main question you have . it 's not entertaining , but perhaps it 's useful : s241 - s256 i s290 - s291 s300 i - s399 s500 - s578 s700 - s758 s4000 - s4999 the box comes with 5 bags ( they ; re strong , i 've discovered ) , 1 dust compartment filter , and one `` super air clean filter . '' miele uses a hepa filter , known for its allegy protection . long-lasting , worth it
1	this is a countertop friendly , cordless espresso maker that makes great coffee when you use an espresso grind for the coffee . the auto shut-off makes it foolproof , and it is made of stainless steel , so no off tastes . i think it is great
1	the filter model i have , 18150 , requires two of these with no foam spacers . two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously . however , i 'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall , maybe slightly less . the cover still goes on , but not as far down as it should . as for filtering , i estimate that it filters the same as the previous . the `` permanence '' of this filter makes me wonder why i 've been replacing the previous style , since i can see no difference in the filter material
0	this as a new and `` improved '' zyliss press . it does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a `` nonstick '' surface . it is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing . the holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick . difficult and time consuming . i have sent multiple e-mails to zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions . zyliss does not respond . the companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative . do n't buy their products
0	the fitted twin sheet when i used in my boy bed on corner to rip ... ..is the worse material use for childrens is sandpaper . the worse product ... the only good thing is that my little sleep better with thomas and friends . i recommend thi sproduct only if your boy is not easy to put it in bed ... .with thomas can sleep without mom or dad
0	first off , this machine looks great . but unfortunately , that 's where the attraction ends . you see , i too used a little krups $ 45 espresso machine for years . but it was a heck of a lot easier to use , and made consistently better espresso/cappucinno than this dog . here 's a brief synopsis . the reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days . i 'm constantly refilling it . after making an espresso , the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end , making a mess of the whole machine . the steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam . the lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion . and positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome . did i mention the thing leaks ? now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino ... ... ... ... ... it does n't
1	this is by far the best toaster we 've ever owned . it does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional , so i do n't know how it works yet , but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side . a fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation . the bagels we toasted in it were just perfect ! the microwave is large enough inside for my purposes , which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting . i never use microwave popcorn so i ca n't say how well it does in that area , but the frozen burrito i cooked last night came out terrific . regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving , i think what the company is referring to is the fact that , while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint , it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster . this does indeed save space , not to mention an electrical outlet . overall , i 'm very pleased with it , but have n't had it long enough to speak to its longevity . i can tell you that it 's almost worth buying for the toaster alone
0	i was disappointed when it arrived in pieces . they did n't pack this well and i had to send it back . i was impressed by the free return postage . i do want this item and have requested another . hopefully it will arrive in one piece this time . then it might be worth more stars
0	it does nothing that i can see except leave a pleasant scent . i scrub it in with a firm bristle brush , wait 30 minutes , vacuum with my dyson , and my carpet still looks the same . it is only 2 years old so it is n't an old carpet . it might work on carpets that are more of a `` pile '' but not berber . i gave 2 stars just for scent alone
1	i recieved this from my husband after he got it as a gift at a secret santa party . it is a really beautiful set and all the candles and accents matched what was advertized . i set it up in my office ( in a different pattern from what was shown ) and it really adds a nice touch , especially with its blend of soothing smells . my only complaint is that one of the glass stones was broken in half and the other half could not be found- it probably slipped through the quality control department at the factory . but it had plenty of others to compensate , so it 's not a big deal . i highly recommend this product , especially if you like to `` customize '' and design your centerpieces rather than have them `` pre-assembled .
1	my husband and i have really enjoyed this product . they are very soft and a good sized towel
1	petsafe batteries are the best . of course they are the only ones that work in the dog collar but they are still very good
1	works great ! easy to pump-it would be nice if there were a clear window to let you know when you need to refill
1	i was glad to see the unit arrived without damage- ( despite poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer ) . the unit works great !
0	i have really enjoyed the quality of all of my other cuisinart cookware . unfortunately , this tea kettle does not belong in the otherwise excellent product line . the kettle 's shape makes it very difficult to pour . the handle conveys all of the heat of the boiling water , so you are not able to touch the handle without a hot pad . i have given up using the whistle attachment for two reasons : first , it is not made of cuisinart 's stainless steel ( it appears to be made of plastic with a silver plastic coating ) , and so it has cracked and peeled from the heat ; and second , it is impossible to remove the whistle when the kettle is hot so you are unable to pour your boiling water ( often all that comes off when attempting to remove the whistle is the decorative ball on its tip ! ) . i really wish that i had returned this tea kettle
1	this towels are probably what most would expect . they look nice and have become my preferred kitchen towel - i cook alot . i would look elsewhere if they were used primarily for drying dishes as they are n't extremely absorbant
1	this is a great product for holding your knives . my wife and i got a nice set of henckel knives as a wedding present . i could n't figure out how i could transport the knives . along with the blade savers , this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives
0	my company bought one of these to replace the similar capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after n years . after 2 days , the led readout of the functional information stopped working . the machine continues to operate , but you ca n't tell what 's going on , how much water it will use for your particular cup etc . very disappointing . we 'll see how good the warranty repair is , and report back to you after we experience *that* .
0	washed them once ( before using ) and now they look really old . they have loose threads hanging out in several places and have small balls all over them . i am not impressed . would not buy again
1	i bought this as a christmas present for a dear friend of mine who recently began collecting rooster objects . the entire set arrived in perfect condition . the colors , red black are vibrant and striking..the rooster pattern is on each piece and is very nice . very good quality , good size and good price ... will make a perfect holiday gift for serving pasta or stew or salad or whatever
1	i got this wok for christmas as a gift . it is perfect . you are able to cook just about anything on this at a high heat without worrying that the food will stick to the bottom of the pan . it is easy to clean . so far i have cooked stir fries and potatoes with chorizo . each time the food came out perfect not undercooked or over cooked .
1	great pot . i 'm annoyed at having to press the `` unlock '' button everytime , the one that prevents accidental spills . the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes , i 'm used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top . in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differences i 'm also really annoyed at the shipping , bought through amazon , it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in , which was n't up for the rigors of shipping . but honestly i ca n't tell if the gaping crowbar-looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no
0	we ordered this for a spare fridge and it would be a great size , but the first on came and it was damaged . it looked like it had been dropped . then i called target . they did great taking care of getting us another on . only the second came today and it was also dropped from a truck . the back was dented and it was already rusting . so i think we will try some where else for this item .
1	wife loves this contraption . if you like your coffee or tea strong you need to use more than usuall . easy to clean . and the best part is that amazon sent me two of them when i purchased one . sweet . cup it comes with is great quality . peace !
1	i have only had it for a few days , but moving up from a krups pump system with only 1050w of heating , this unit rocks ! it used to take me about 10 minutes to make a latte with the krups , as it took forever to heat uo and never made enough steam . this unit heats very fast and makes fantastic steam for the frother , which works fantastic , minus the complaint everyone has , the frother is way to low to the ground , they fixed this with the evolution model . watch the video ! the tamping and normal uses need to be followed very closely . i have to use the perfect crema device to make crema , which it does great . this unit also can be used to heat water for tea in like 2 mins , which is pretty cool . you just fire up the unit . wait till it heats , then flip the espresso switch , not the steam switch , with the steam adjuster already open , then hot water comes from the frother and boom ... tea ! the drip tray is worthless , and is supposedly fixed in the evolution model . but for $ 200 this machine is amazing ... very professional level equipment . the abs shell is pretty flimsy , but if it stays on the counter , which mine does , it will be fine ... i do n't need to spend another $ 300 for the stainless model ... even though i would if i has a nicer kitchen just so it matched ... ( i rent but still have really nice appliances ) .
0	coffee warmer only keeps coffee lukewarm . so i am still in the market for a coffee warmer
1	have to disagree with the other reviewer here ... i purchased a baby biorb recently for my new betta , after having my first betta living in an airless bowl for a couple years . i simply got tired of cleaning a stinky bowl every week . as a result , i went shoppin for a new tank with a bubbler and filter system and found the baby biorb . while i agree that the maintence costs are significant at $ 132/ year ( if you need to change a filter every 4 weeks ) , the costs balance with ease of maintenance . personally , my experience with cleaning the baby biorb was a snap with the optional suction hose . took me fifteen minutes to clean the tank , drain the grimey water and add new water . could n't have been much easier . and , i am not sure how anyone could have a problem swapping filter cartriges unless they have motor skills issues . i also built a noise dampening box for the air pump - my only real complaint is that the `` whisper quiet '' pump sounds like a mini jackhammer after about five minutes . great product and looks awesome .
1	i was looking for a tool to process the exotic fruit i grow , and amazon had the largest selection
0	this electric blanket has the nicest texture of the last `` five '' electric blankets we have purchased . however it stopped working within a month , like the other four . who makes a realiable electric blanket ? not sunbeam and not this brand . since the texture on this one is nice , we can at least keep it as an extra cuddling blanket
1	bought this product with a gift certificate from my children . i am very satisfied with the bowls . i give this product a high recommendation
0	light is beautiful and functional , and so great for traveling , but first led light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months . too bad .
0	i baked six loaves in this machine . i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things do n't turn out just right . my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures . even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked . i was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe . the machine was quiet , strong , and had a lot of bells and whistles , but with only partially baked bread , i had to return it to amazon . amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back , and were quick enough with the refund
0	i made a mistake in buying this item thinking since i had one when i was little it would be similiar.it is not , the edges are stiff and strings are pulling out.the fuzz all over the blanket gets all over your sheets.it is a raggedy sorry substitute for my cozy soft one i remember
0	i purchased this high-end toaster oven because i wanted /needed a proficient smaller oven for smaller baking needs . after 5 months of moderate usage , however , the middle knob has malfunctioned and it will no longer bake . other than that i was satisfied with the product . i called their customer service and to get it repaired under warranty , will have to ship it at least 250 miles away , at my expense . what a hassle . i may just go buy a cheap toaster oven to replace it instead of spending the time and money on postage . live and learn ... .just because a product costs more does n't mean it 's better .
0	looks quite cheap , not as good from the pictur
0	gaggia used to be the cat 's meow in espresso . they have lost the bubble in the last ten years . many other machines do more , are easier to use , and produce better cups in an easier manner . i still have my old gaggia , but now rely on a saeko in my home . the difference is obvious
0	still ca n't figure out what this scissor cuts ... ... ... ... ..it surely is not poultry , or meat or fish ... ... ... ... ... .i will have to try it on paper but then i did n't need another paper scissor ! ! ! ! !
1	this scale is quite accurate and easy to read . the only problem may be that it can be a little touchy when trying to adjust the needle in order to use a different container
0	i really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush . unfortunetly it is just messy , annoying and takes up counter space . when you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction . if the cereal is too big ( honeycomb size ) it does n't come out easily . if it is too small ( fruity pebbles ) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere ! i definetly would not buy this product again . at one point i even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away . the time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter
1	love these glasses for our beach house . shorter stems allow them to be placed in dishwasher . martinis seem to taste better in the large sized glass
0	unless you 're planning on washing dinner plates only , this dish rack is not for you . smaller plates ( or bowls for that matter ) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips ( about 1/8 inch ) so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open ( 3 1/4 inches ) . anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor . the utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom . i bought this thinking that since polder has a good name , it would be a good product . i was wrong and polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design
1	i absolutely love this decanter . i have had two others -- one very expensive , one inexpensive , both without handles . while very elegant , they were a nightmare to clean and pour . they both broke ... well , good riddance ! this is the best decanter , large surface area , angled mouth , and indespensable handle . i have received compliments every time i use it while entertaining . i am ordering several more for gifts . i am positive they will please all who receive them . perfect
0	the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper , but there is no such knob on the mini grinders . we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder does n't work . disappointing
1	i got these to dress up our daily fiestaware as salad plates , and they go beautifully with the persimmon especially , but also brighten up the sunflower or periwinkle ... stack up really nicely and compactly unlike the fistaware : - ) enjoy !
0	i bought this toaster after reading several reviews , finding a reasonable price , and liking the look of it . i was looking to upgrade since my old toaster ( a toastmaster ) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown . i am seriously disappointed with this toaster . i put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts , and that half usually ends up burnt . the slots are slanted forward , and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster , it is the upper portion that over toasts , and the lower portion comes out essentially raw . though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so , and had to go through two cycles ... .it still toasted better then this t-fal . i bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times , i am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand . hope this helps
0	i purchased the f69204 for $ 150 on sale . used once that year with good results . it was another year before i tried to use again . shortly after starting the motor , it froze up and quit . on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor , instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed . the parts book said you could order the motor alone , but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of $ 90 plus shipping . in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail
1	i am potty training my son , so i needed a good waterproof mattress pad but did n't want to spend a lot of money . this fits the bill . it 's lightweight but sturdy , and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress , and held up well in the wash so far . has a nice feel , and it does n't seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do . our mattress is old and thin by today 's standards , but the pad seems roomy enough that i think if we got a new thick mattress , it would still work . very pleased with this purchase
0	if you read between the lines on the other reviews here , i think you 'll see that everyone thinks this thing is junk . and their right ! ! ! no matter how small the job , it wo n't do it . it 's just one more `` made in china '' piece of junk that i 've wasted money on . it wo n't suck anything off hard wood or carpet floors . i do n't get how any company , let alone a well known vacuum company , could sell such a usless tool . my only question is how could anyone give this thing two or more stars ? ?
0	i am not a coffee connoisseur , so my criteria for a good coffee maker is probably modest . i bought the ka javastudio because i own several ka appliances and have always been pleased . although , the ka 10-cup is pricey , i felt that buying a thermal carafe represented an upgrade from my previous glass carafe . i also figured that the wide spray mechanism might mean a richer cup of coffee . i did as much research as i could , reading reviews and looking at available coffee makers in my area . after trying out our new ka yesterday , my husband and i were both disappointed in its functionality and performance . here are some points to consider about this product : 1 . the ka 10-cup makes 4 1/4 oz cups . in other words , if you 're looking for 8 ounce servings , the most this will make is about 5 real cups of coffee . 2 . the thermal carafe is heavy . if you 're planning on keeping this on your counter - and possibly under a cabinet , it is a tug to pull it out each time you use it to pour water in the back . 3 . there is no way to figure out the water level in the tank . the directions say to use the optional white water filter insert . 4 . for us at least , taste-wise , there is no discernible difference between what the ka brewed and what we 've tolerated with our old coffee maker . good luck with your search for a more perfect coffee maker .
0	i have owned a roomba for several years , and have been very pleased with its performance , so i was very excited to purchase the scooba . however , it has been the worst purchase that i ever made . the first one that i received would quit working every time it bumped into furniture or the wall . irobt did send a replacement , but it only works about half of the time . the other half of the time , it does not vacuum up the dirty water , so it leaves the floor dirtier than before i `` cleaned '' it . i have contacted irobot for help , but none of their suggestions have worked . honestly , i would throw it in the trash if it did not cost so much
0	after just 7 months . so be aware that you might buy into some hassle by exchanging the knifes with henckels . i am very dissappointed and will not spend that much money ( $ 80 ) on knifes ever again , at least not on henckels . my k-mart knifes hold up better
0	functionally , this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner . it is not attractive to look at however . my walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany , there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish , the varnish is very high gloss , and the knobs are low-grade , mismatched junk . i believe the build is solid , but only time will tell . final word ... .pay the extra money for a hand-crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally . this just is n't worth $ 300
0	i just do n't like this item . got it as a wedding gift and have hardly used it because it sucks , plain and simple . do n't buy . there are others out there that are better . not kitchenaid quality here ! ! !
0	when i opened the product , the sheets really were soft . but when you 're laying on them , they are n't very comfortable . i would n't buy another set again . but they were cheap , so not a horrible buy
0	well , its uz hot to the touch and it has n't really seemed to help my cat with her tension . maybe she just does n't have a problem that feliway can help . anyway , i 'm not too thrilled . speedy delivery though
0	i 've ordered three . two were broken , as were two replacements they sent . fragile plastic breaks and ca n't support the weight of the drawers and spices . they were really nice about sending replacements and refunds , though .
0	the thermometer of this heater is completely messed up . it does not measure the room temperature , but the temperature of the air that has just been heated up . in other words , if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so ( according to the thermometer reading ) in less 2 minutes and stop . if you do not use this functionality , but instead let the heater run for some time ( 5-10 minutes ) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees . the thermometer is probably in the wrong location . did honeywell do any kind of testing before putting this model on the market ?
1	i have always used the metal irons and was concerned about the nonstick . i was afraid the structure would create thicker pizzelles which are more cookie like versus light and wafer . the first ones came out and were sticking to the surface . i was disheartened thinking i am having the same problem as with the metal . i switched to nonstick to avoid this . oh well , try again ... .and from that moment on was smooth sailing . i like the light indicator on this model , the easy clean up , storage design ... ..just everything .
0	i had this blender for 3-4 years and was very unhappy with it . the design is poor ( liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured ) , the motor seems weak , and it is hard to clean . food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable . today , after only sporadic , medium-duty use over the few years i had it , my blender outright died . i have other cuisinart products that perform very well , but this blender is a loser
1	i started to order replacement filters at $ 47.99 ( too expensive ) - but found the whole machine was on sale for only $ 49.99 - so i got 3 spare machines . i 'll be looking for one with a washable filter before those need replacement . by the way - they do remove dust and pollen and the like - and i 'm happy with their performance .
0	while this is an attractive looking paper-towel holder , it is n't very functional . at first glance , it looks like it should work as implied : 'spring-loaded arm puts pressure on paper towel roll , regardless of how many towels are on that roll at the time , allowing you to easily rip off a single sheet with one hand ' . unfortunately , this model does n't work that way ... at least , not the one i received . i started with a partial roll , and it was obvious this would n't work , so i put in an extra-large roll of top quality ( very thick roll ) paper towels , and still , they do n't come close to reaching the spring-loaded arm . this arm is no more effective at preventing a number of sheets from pulling off the roll than the old wooden one i had with no arm at all . i 'm very disappointed . before deciding on this model , i had viewed some very similar models that were higher in price ... maybe this is a case of `` you get what you pay for '' . if you are looking for a paper towel holder that looks nice , and are not concerned about `` function '' ... it may be worth the price . if you are looking for one that looks nice and can offer you an easy one-sheet-at-a-time-with-one-hand quick pull , i suggest you look for a different model . this unit wo n't do that job
1	this product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic . amazingly , it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer ( just a thin cardboard box with no padding ) . the only real gripe i have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper . the hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side . this does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation , but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities - one of the reasons why i picked this particular product in the first place . if it were not for the flawed lid , i would have given this product a five-star rating .
1	we recently moved , and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment . one cat , usually friendly and playful , would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment . the other cat , usually very docile , was being overly aggressive during `` play time '' with the other cat and with us . after buying the comfort zone plug-in , we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week . both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal - more friendly and playful , less anxious and aggressive . the only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug-in vial will last 4 weeks , but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3 . but maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left . it is hard to judge when the plug-in actually ran out because the cats ' behavior did not change , even after i unplugged the diffuser
1	when i pick up the brush both my dogs fight to be first . my chow has long hair that is always in knots on her backside . this brush just plowed right through them and she never even seem to notice . my malamute thinks i have nothing better to do than use it on her . it completely got rid of the odors . my dogs rate it their second favorite thing in the house just under their food . the most amazing thing was i had to buy a second brush as i found by accident that it works for me too . i have very long hair that gets knotted very easy . in a hurry one day i picked up their brush and in seconds the knot was gone . no pulling no ripping of hair . if you have the same trouble i suggest you give it a try . would be super for kids
1	i have ordered two of these from this vendor . both times the product was received almost a month after i ordered it . the product is nice and of good construction , but again if you need this in a hurry , choose another place because they dont know how to mail it right out
1	there 's nothing worse than having to find space for , and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it . henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop , and because she 's on the countertop , you will use her . she works great . will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling . i tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs , but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me . she poaches four eggs perfectly , and here , you can use jumbos if you like . the water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her , if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done , adding more or less water the next time will take care of that . actually , the first time i poached jumbos , i found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste ; i added a bit more water to the cooker , plugged her back in , and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute . when the water evaporates , she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing ( as i am ) . i love this cooker . first one i have ever owned . and because she looks cute sitting on the counter , i do n't forget i have her ; therefore , she gets used alot
0	i hated these shakers . i got them as a gift and 1. they are too big and take up too much space and 2. the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3. the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once . finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out . the other , smaller fiesta ware ones -- the round ones -- are much much better
0	i thought this breadbox was beautiful in the picture and unique because of the two compartments . the construction , however , is horrible . the wood was split at the screw locations on the lid . i returned the box and received another one . the wood was split at the screw sites on the bottow of the second box . it is very poorly put together and the material is cheap . this certainly is not worth the price
1	this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there . the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup , eliminating the scoop step . it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate , along with cup amounts . the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on , however . anyways , bottom line : it grinds great with little mess .
0	it 's weird . the handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome `` emeril '' logo , then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it 's shape easily . you 'd hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle , but not here . it 's not a bad whisk for the price , but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars , buy something else .
0	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc
0	i was very excited with such a inexpensive purchase for high count sheets , but very soon i learned it was not such a great deal . beware if using them on an older mattress which is not thick ! after putting on the fitted sheet , it looked like a huge skin on a baby elephant ! loose material everywhere . my real complaint is the pills , which appeared only a few days into use . they snag on rings , watch bracelets , etc . i would never purchase this material again .
0	not the best sheet experience . my legs broke out in a rash . best to wash before using , i guess . the thread count is a bit lacking , too . for microfiber sheets , i want a cloud-like surface . i will go for a higher priced item next time
0	it looked okay when i opened it . then i washed it before using and my washer and dryer were full of `` cranberry '' colored lint ( wet in the washer and dry in the dryer ) . the next time i washed it was better but , still some lint in the washer and normal in the dryer . it is not warm enough alone . it might be okay in the warmer months but , not what i expected for winter
1	this comforter is wonderful . beautiful fabric and a very warm and comfortable piece . i am delighted to have purchased it
1	due to the slits around the opening , this label will fit a wide variety of neck sizes including burgundy and those odd rosemount shiraz necks . i would like it better if it were more of a plastic coated paper since i think it would hold up longer in a cellar , but at least it fits all my bottles . the others i 've purchased do n't
0	item was defective and this was te second item receive
1	these pans are made by ekco and durable . the nice thing is they do not brown the edges like the tephlon coated ones . just be sure to use wax paper on the bottom and they will come out with ease
0	this is not and i repeat is not a good alarm . there is one alarm light and you can hardly tell which one is sounding . it looks as if the specs are lying to me and i hate lies . also the battery died after 6-8 months . the low battery alert is loud and chirps so anoyingly . i also noticed that the alarm sounds a loud shrieking alarm when it sounds . i will return this alarm . never again will i trust in first alert
0	if i could give this product 0 stars , i would . read the negative reviews , folks , and be forewarned . i believed the positive reviews and ignored the negative ones , much to my exasperation . when i plugged my handsome new oven in , the little red digital display numbers came on right away ... hmmm ... so far so good . but , according to the instructions , you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell . sooo ... the owner 's manual says to push the `` bake '' button on the dashboard , which in turn lights the pilot lid light on the display , after which you can set `` time '' and `` temp '' . so i push the `` bake '' button and nothing happens , no lid light comes on . nothing . zilch . zippo . so i then push the `` temp '' and `` time '' lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up . still nothing . i unplugged it and and plugged it in again , thinking that maybe somehow i had screwed that up , while listening for the `` beep '' the owner 's manual said should happen whence the unit is plugged in . zilch . zippo . nothing . no `` beep '' . no `` bake '' lid light . tried pusing the `` temp '' and `` time '' buttons again . nada . tried unpugging it again and doing the whole shebang all over again . still nothing . it just sat there and grinned at me . about this time , i figured out that my unit was also `` dead on arrival '' . at least you can get a parcel paid bill of lading printed off from the amazon website for a defective product return , saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product you have already paid for and now must wait weeks to get a refund on . amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse and run them over with a forklift
1	having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan , as the tittle says : pay the 3-4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead . i 'm using the preseasoned more because it is just ready . keep in mind its large and heavy . careful in your sink . coming from stainless steel and converted over to calphalon ( mostly bought all pieces from amazon.com ) , if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me . heat kills everything . if you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water / salt / scrubbing.. and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark , then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with . but we all pay for convience and these pans i use mostly to sear meat . with a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives , get the preseasoned .
0	my kids think this is a better toy than our dog . was n't worth the money i paid for it . comes apart too easy
0	i have two bath sheets and two hand towels . they do not absorb water
1	this is probably my favorite mug . it easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup . it comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim . the best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over . even hard corners do n't seem to phase it . it 's also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat 's efforts to tip it over . the odd shape also has downsides though . it wo n't fit in any cup holder i 've ever come across , but that does n't matter much since it wo n't tip over no matter where you set it . if you do n't rinse it out immediately , it can be difficult to clean later , due to the shape ; if you do n't have small hands , you may need a bottle cleaning brush . also , i imagine if you had more than one of these mugs , they 'd be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space . despite this , it 's still a great mug . in fact i 'm going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too
0	i ordered a tailchaser for my cat before and i had no problems with getting my order but not with this one . its been over a month and i still havent received the 2nd one i ordered ! i will never order from them again
1	i like the idea of this bundt pan . i made 3 batches of chocolate truffles on it . the recipe that comes with the pan is awesome . however , i have yet to figure out how to get the chocolates out easily . the first time , i used a non-stick spray ( not vegetable oil ) . i thought that might be my problem because the company recommends vegetable oil . on the next two batches , i poured vegetable oil in the little holes and spread it around using a pastry brush . again , i had to fight to get the chocolates out . i kid you not -- my husband pounded on the pan with a big rubber mallet to get the chocolates to come out ! i must be doing something wrong . i will call customer service tomorrow -- but if there is a trick to this , they should have told you on the instructions on how to make the truffles ! other than that , the chocolates turned out beautifully and i will use this pan again , even if i have to call my husband to help me out with his rubber mallet
0	i had this vacuum for about a month . the suction was so bad that after every room i had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction . i hated it ! not only that but the bagless was a pain ! i had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy ! not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever . it made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in ! i did not want that in my house ! i absolutely hated this vacuum
1	i received my butter dish in a very timely fashion very well packaged too . the product is wonderful it 's being used on a daily basis . i am extremely happy with the product the shipper
0	had trouble finding out how to put it together -- - then the motor started and would not stop -- - had trouble getting the bottom in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again . i would return it but it is too heavy to move -- - heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task . i will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop . that should not take too long
0	check out kmart.com they have the samething for 39.99 a $ 20 savings
1	ove glove is great -- everything they say it is . my husband is the chef . it was my valentine 's day gift to him and he 's happy as a clam ! thanks , ove glove
1	i now own 3 of these platters . ( one is the halloween one ! ) i use them constantly for entertaining . the platter is large enough to put a pizza on , or stack deserts , just about anything . it is easy to clean , as is mose fiesta , fits in my dishwasher , and looks great
0	i bought this cleaner for use in between major vacuuming . it clogs very quickly without having swept up very much . it is probably fine for floors without carpet
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided . much smaller than anticipated , i can only fit a tablespoon in it
1	this is truly a great waffle maker to have if you have kids . they love to eat them and make their own
0	i bought this heater at lowe 's after returning another delonghi model to amazon . it 's great for a bedroom because it is practically silent . the heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do ... allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm . that was the good news . the bad news is that after a few months , it broke down . it turns off when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up . as another reviewer said , it is now an attractive retro paperweight , but that 's about it . i was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having , i 'm not going to bother . after battling with delonghi over other retro products , i 'm giving up . i wo n't buy any of their stuff anymore . by the way , if you want a great , silent heater , try the bionaire micathermic model ( bnrbh3900u ) . it does n't have the snazzy styling of the delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year
1	this is a very nice pan for $ 20 . the non-stick surface works very well , even without cooking oil . the heavy aluminum heats up very evenly . the glass lid helps prevent over-cooking . of course , non-stick pans are for low-to-medium heat only . you can not use this pan for high-heat stir frying
0	the add said it would seperate small berry seeds . the holes on the smallest grate are about 1/8 '' . you could fit 20 seed through one of them . very disappointing
1	looks and works just as advertised . took it out of the box and used it the day we received it , made for a lovely and lively family dinner . great buy
0	i bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price . wrong ... this pots get scratches from anything that goes near them . after a few months of gentle use , they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful . also , the handles get really hot .
0	what a piece of crap . just putting this together broke it . and was missing one of the snap parts . truely a waste of money
0	this can opener is complete garbage . other reviews have told the story about how this thing does not work . i tried it three times , each time with new batteries , and it grunted to a stop after a millisecond . had to battle with the thing all three times , twisting and turning the stupid can opener to free it from its grasp on the side of the can . the seam broke and leaked juice all over the counter . the `` handy '' screw to back the can opener up , was of very little use . you are better off with a cheap electric can opener any time , or a hand crank can opener . with this device , you might as well throw 20-bucks out on the lawn . this piece of garbage ended up in the garbage . completely worthless . do not waste your money
0	whatever you do , do n't buy a shark . it is a total waste of money . it has to be the worst purchase that i have ever made . you can not contact the manufacturer . smart move on their part , their phone system would be overloaded with complaints
1	my girlfriend received this kettle last christmas and it 's still working ... i even use it at times . so easy to use , fill it up 3/4 of the way with water and push down the red tab thingy . nice and hot in 30-45 seconds ... a minute for larger cup full
1	this knife has made me eat more vegetables , just because it 's so much fun to chop carrots . i was a little concerned with the handle at first , but it 's very comfortable , and is n't slick at all , even in soapy water . i also worried that maybe i should have gotten the bigger version of this knife . again , my fears were unfounded , as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation . you ca n't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job ... but if you 've ever had that feeling , you already know how you 'll feel using a global . when i slice carrots for snacks , they come out as perfect , translucent discs . any vegetable i 've cut has been a joy
1	blinds were what i expected . they were very good quality and low price too . shipping was excellent and on time .
0	i am totally dissatisfy with this product and this is damn waste of money . brita base was working for just 2 week initially and now i able to get a water from filter but there is no light glowing either green or red . the base was showing red flash light on end of first week for the first new filter which suppose to come upto atleast 2 months . i recommed you all ... dont buy it
0	i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer . there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it . worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working . one of the controls literally `` froze '' in place and the machine was unusable . no way to fix it - had to throw it away . what a shame . next time i will pay closer attention to what people write . my advice - by something other than a honeywell . i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately - another waste of money
1	my son , who lives in washington , uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer . we live in california , but bought this fan to help vent our computer room , which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning . because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled , it works great . we plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down .
1	for an inexpensive pizza stone , it does the job . if you 're looking for something that is more versatile , look somewhere else . this stone is primarily for breads , pizza and the like . i know this because i tried baking cookies on it . the cookies turned out fine , but they stuck to the stone . however , when i make home made pizza from scratch , the crust comes out perfect ! not too soft , not too crisp . it bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust
1	i have this bowl and the larger one . they are perfect bowls for mixing . the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put . i was them in the dishwasher without any problems
0	this is the most poorly designed machine i have ever seen . it is continually clogging both filters and the hepa filter becomes filled with dirt quickly causing loss of all suction . i replaced it with the dyson dc17 , which is awesome . do not buy this vacuum
1	a very nice blender ... it crushes and purees , just about anything.. i 've had it for three years now and it is still in great condition , and still very powerful ... very loud ! you might need ear protection as you use this . i often turn it on , leave the room , do something else , and come back in when i think it is done ! i 'm not kidding ! :
1	nice compact size-can be moved easily . does freshen the air in the room noticeably . on whisper setting is almost silent . on turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life , maybe would sleeping . does shoot out air but does not `` blow '' with any force . over time , like a day , all the air in our 20'x20 ' living area changes . did have a noticeable plastic like new odor the first few days of use which wore off . have n't had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks , but it would be easy to clean .
0	... after two months , a piece of the filter broke off . after 3 months , the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere . cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website , so i could pay another $ 30 or so for a new carafe , because glass is not included in their warranty . no thanks
1	my mom has arthritis in her hands pretty bad . most peelers are difficult to impossible for her to use . not this one , it works flawlessly . it is easy to hold in her hand , and the blade is sharp enough to do a great job on potatos and carrots
1	this stone is very functional -- works well and goes from oven to table because of its beauty . if you 've never cooked on stone before , prepare to be amazed . it 's a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust . i also use the stone for baking french fries and other stuff . just put the pan directly on the stone and your food will be done faster . with use your stone will discolor . this happens with any stone . you also should not wash any stone with soap . use hot water and a plastic scraper to clean . this is the only all clad product i have that i ca n't get the stainless to sparkle like new . i think it 's because i left it in the oven so much . the pizza cutter that comes with this is the best i 've ever used . because of its size , this product is great as a bake-and-serve/occasional baking stone . if you bake a ton , i suggest getting a larger stone and just leaving it the oven all the time
0	within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off . this is not the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect . this is my third ( and final ) bread machine . the first two were breadman ultimates . i should note that i make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average , pretty much every morning . the first breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail . this was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time ( water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond ) . i bought an new breadman ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems . this time i took extremely good care of the pan ( letting it cool down , no soaking ) because it 's clearly the weak link in the system . within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out . whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed , making the machine useless . currently it does n't seem very easy ( or even possible ) to buy a replacement pan for the breadman . at this point i was done with the breadman . much as i did n't want to spring for the extra money for the zojirushi , and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably would n't work the same in the new machine , i did n't see an alternative and got one . within 3 weeks the teflon in the zoji pan formed two blisters . one is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off ; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact . i have been extremely careful with the pan : i wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers . i do n't let it soak at all . this is clearly a manufacturing defect . i have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the breadman ultimate : 1 ) the top of the bread rarely gets brown . i 've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much . 2 ) i do n't understand what the crust control option does . it does n't seem to increase baking time which it does on the breadman so it does n't make much sense . 3 ) the programmability is very weak . on the breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs . 4 ) the programmability options are very limited : - you ca n't control the knockdown time between risings . - you ca n't add risings to the default three . they do give you a lot of time control on the risings . - you ca n't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle : it 's all one cycle . - when you turn off the preheat cycle , this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones . - and worst of all : you ca n't bake for more than 70 minutes . this is utterly ridiculous . i 'm sure this is a `` safety feature '' but it means you ca n't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth . this is almost a killer limitation in my opinion . for those other reviewers that are having issues with rising , i 've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount , type , and quality of yeast . if you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast , it should work okay . this means you must use rapid rise yeast with the quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs . even using fleischmann 's instead of red star made a difference . the breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations . at this point i 'm done with bread machines . they are a failed technology . in fact , teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology . all you have to do is search for teflon ( polytetrafluoroethylene ) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance . the manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination . a direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees ( eg : frying pans ) . perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low , but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale : there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures . imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread . i 've thought about this , but there 's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon , there is just no other viable solution . i love making bread every day and i 'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean i have to give up on this technology . it 's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it 's the only rational and healthy solution
1	i normally do n't write reviews ... but after owning several toasters in the past , and being very disappointed , i just had to write about this one . i owned an old toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years . it never did brown evenly , but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke . got my money 's worth . i have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions , amazon , and others ... and many people have n't been very happy with toasters they have bought costing nearly $ 300.00 ( dualit ) . toastmaster , ge , rival , dualit , most kitchenaid and sunbeam models were poorly rated . i found one review on this sunbeam ( this is their top of the line model , the chrome and black model costs more , but currently not in production . ) and the person really really liked it . so i ordered this from amazon directly , this was the very lowest price i could find . order something else so as to get their free shipping ! ! ! ( over $ 25.00 ) so what happened when i got it . got the toaster ... plugged it in ... dropped two slices of bread in , and excitedly waited for my toast . a few minutes passed ... .. then.. pop ! its done ... or so i thought . when the toast came out ... it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted . this goes for both slices . right then and there i was ready to send this thing back . well ... . had been busy that week and continued using it day after day ... each day was as disappointing as the first ... .. then ... . after a little over a week ... . the bread started toasting ... uh.. well perfectly ! ! ! after owning this for nearly 4 months ... it still browns evenly on both sides of each piece of bread , crisp on the outside , soft on the inside . i do n't know why it started working right ... would n't think that it would need to be `` broken in '' to work right . i am so glad that i did n't send this back right after the first several toastings ... . procrastinating worked out in my best interest , for the first time . i have not tried bagels in this ... do n't like bagels ... . but it does well for what i bought it for . i think the style is rather funky , but many people have liked its looks . if this toaster works for you as good as it has for me ... i think you will like it ! ! ! if it does n't work well right out of the box ... . you might give it a few days ... . maybe the toast fairy will bless you too .
0	i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i can not make any judgment about its longterm durability , but the first ( and only ) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime , and the dye used on the `` moss '' green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent . i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm , and has an attractive weave
1	i bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning , and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day . this is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves . some of the honeycombs get a little crushed , but i 've found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them . reese 's puffs and cheerios also came out without any crushing . you have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh . maybe this was in the directions , but i missed it and learned the hard way . but the kids figured out the caps easily and it 's not a big deal for them
1	i bought this when my air popper died i am so glad i found this product ! the popcorn is the best it is very simple to make . the thing i like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn . i can choose which oil to use how much so i have total control over what goes into my popcorn so i feel confident that what i am eating is good for me . the packaged corn that came with was ok a good introduction to using the popper but i will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own . i did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book it was fantastic ! i would recommend this to anyone , the popper is easy to handle , easy to clean it makes the best , crisp crunchy popcorn ever . it only takes about 3 minutes to be done you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings . sometimes simple old fashioned is better that is the case with this item . now we ca n't wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night !
0	i read the review for this product on amazon . lindsey who is one of the 2 reviewers of this product actually had posted a video of the product usage and i was very much convinced by that . i thought the product is good and ordered it immediately . the product arrived in 4-5 days and was in good condition . the most important problem with the roti maker is 1. the roti/tortilla is not cooked properly . it remains very much uncooked . even though you see it puff and everything from the inside it remains uncooked which actually causes a lot of acidity problems . 2 . also such an uncooked tortilla when left for a few minutes becomes very dry and difficult to eat . you have to eat the tortilla immediately within 10-15 minutes of the making . just imagine if you are making 5-7 tortillas the first one will be come dry and difficult to chew . 3 . the product works as described but the tortillas are not at all good for health since they remain uncooked in the inside
1	second set of these glases , and love them . do n't sweat hold a full can of soda plus ice . even without ice , the drink stays cold . no problem with dropping ice in them , no breaking or cracking . great product
1	i have been using a chemex 10-cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life . i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee ! there is a downside to this coffee maker : it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to , and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently . the first time i tried to use mine , i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever ! the big time consumers : you have to boil your water separately ( you do have a water kettle right ? ) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex . this means that while the coffee is brewing , you are pouring , or watching , or giving the filter area a bit of a stir . now the up side : you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee . i use filtered water , freshly ground home roasted beans , and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking . and this coffee is a pleasure ! in fact , i 've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide . another up side : clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain . you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary . a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new . try that with your electric drip machine ! ha ! that thing will never look brand new ! oh , here 's a final upside : this chemex brews the best coffee you 'll ever drink , and it costs less than just about anything . you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks ! go ahead and buy yourself one of these . if necessary , wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee . better yet , wake up 20 minutes earlier . and when your coffee is ready , instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door , sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes . you deserve it ! update : it 's been a year now and i still love this chemex . however , over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use . nothing i tried got it clean , but something my wife tried did : a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing . now my chemex looks brand new
0	being lost without a timer for everything ! , i purchased this to replace one that jumped into the dishpan ... ... having a clock and the ability to time three events at once are great features , but the alarm is too soft . i have hearing problems , but even at a distance to 12-15 inches , the alarm is easy to miss . even my sharp eared children agree . i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing ... . a lesson learned for me .
1	although it has two prongs to do two shapes at the same time , i had problems with the cookies sticking together so i would recommend only using one mold at a time
0	i saw an ad for rabbit comparing it to reidel . it is no reidel . heavier than i expected , and larger than i expected
0	this product does not pick up dirt on laminate flooring at all which was not my impression when it was advertised
1	i wanted a dual coffee/espresso maker thinking i would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence , but i was totally surprised how easy it is to use , and now it 's lattes every day . also , there was almost no learning curve -- my first cup ( surprisingly , from what i 've read elsewhere ) was near perfect , and apparently it was n't a fluke . if there is any drawback , it 's only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe ( but i 'm sure a purist would scoff at such a notion ) . if i have one recommendation , it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe ( or whatever it 's called ) to steam your milk . i 'm not a physicist so i 'm not sure why , but it does make a difference . in summation , this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice . ( i give it 4 stars instead of 5 because i have to grind the beans , and it did n't include an intravenous unit )
1	this is a strudy , well built product . it was very easy to install . i did it in 15 minutes . my wife loves it . now she has a lot more room in her sewing room . we opted to paint it , but it can be stained also . we reccommend it highly
1	i threw out all of my old tupperware cups that my kids were using and switched to a supply of fiestaware ceramic cups . now that my kids are all over 5 , we do n't need all that ugly plastic . these are durable and attractive . a range of colors lets them keep track of which cup is theirs . plus , it matches my other dinnerware . it 's the perfect size for them . when they get older and need a bigger glass , these are perfect for juice
1	my wife wanted two sets to match our new family room decor . well , they turned out to be so beautiful that we have replaced our good formal china with this set . really gorgeous pattern and color . the red has a slight orange cast and is not a perfect match for a more maroon red . the sets arrived in perfect condition although the two outside box were very beat up . excellent packaging . a fabulous deal
0	after about a month , it started producing cool-mist that smelled funny , like something bad had rotted in the room . the filters are a nuisance . i think i 'm much better off with a steam vaporizer
0	i 've had two of these stop working when used with olive oil , sadly , though the canola oil one is still going strong
0	i bought this item about 6 months ago . after 2 months the handle fell off . on phoning the company , they said plastic parts were only guaranteed for 1 month , hence they would not replace it . after another 2 months , the unit stopped working altogether . i then got in touch with the company and managed to speak to a very rude customer service representative , who said i would have to send it to the company and pay for shipping and handling myself , yet it says in the handbook that the company would pay for the shipping . i am truely disappointed with the lack of customer care and the appliance . i do believe i have a faulty appliance but the compnay is not at all bothered to keep its customers happy . i do not reccomend that anyone buy this item , save your money and all the hastle
0	sleep better ? how could you sleep better when your pillow has a warning- flamable label ? scary . the pillows are soft but does not have great neck support . i 'm usually a side or stomach sleeper . the pillows are better for hugging
1	i really like these plates . i bought the crocks as well and have no issues with them . the go together really nicely if you are serving soup and salad for dinner guests . i love the colors and i am happy with my purchase . the price was attractive as well
0	this appliance has several good features , but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast . at the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown , the other side barely toasted . the inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side . we did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread , setting a timer for 1 minute , pressing cancel , reversing the bread , and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again . far too much work
0	hey , i was n't expecting much but seriously , these are a pretty bad . i bought two of these for my office . the plastic shade comes all dented and looks so cheap . the stupid pieces do n't fit together right and so if you move it , you have to pick it up from the base or it falls apart . and the switch gets stuck pretty much all the time so that it 's really hard to turn it . i 'm the kind of person who enjoys fixing things so i 've taken it apart and tried to fix it and its still rotten . the second lamp is just completely broken now after only 6 weeks . save your money ! ! ! ! i 'm back on amazon looking for new lamps actually :
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes . i really wish i 'd kept my old ones , even though they were black . the size of these is nice for flour , sugar , etc . ; however , the rubber seals in them are n't great . the seal on my flour ( biggest one ) falls in every single time i take the lid off . they 're pretty , but not very functional
1	my cats started drinking a lot more water after i bought this . the intention of this product is to mimic flowing water . cats love water movement , they are attracted to it and want to drink it . the more water they drink , the healthier they are . try it , your cats will love it too
0	my grandmother had one of these in her kitchen and i can remember all the kids fighting over who got to sit on the stool at large family gatherings . i 'm really sorry that i let her 's get away from us when she died . i was so excited to see this stool on amazon and could not wait to get it . but i returned it within less than 5 minutes of taking it out of the box . first of all it is a lot smaller than you think . my daughter 's wooden highchair is larger than this stool . but what really made me dislike it is the color . to call it red is very misleading . i would say it was closer to orange , which does n't appeal to me or match my kitchen .
0	i have used this vacuum for over a year now . i consistently have trouble with the belts staying on . i can not count the number of times i 've had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts . if it even rolls over something uneven on the floor , the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving . also , although `` bagless '' sounded great , this vacuum is very , very messy to clean out . i have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere . it also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments . i write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached . i have taken this vacuum apart for the last time..
1	this is , hands-down , the best hair removal tool on the market . it grabs an astounding amount of undercoat and topcoat hair . just one usage of it on my dog cut his shedding by at least 75 % . regarding the complaints : yes , hair will go all over the place , but that 's stated in the instructions ; use it in an area where you can sweep or vacuum
1	the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to : -grill area -regidity of the cast iron grill -control for raising or lowering goals -large charcoal shelf -three compartments within the charcoal shelf -heavy guage metal construction -the option of adding a rotisserie the grill is wanting in regards to : -lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill -lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals
1	it 's still brand new , so everything 's working great . i really love the color ; i bought it to match my yellow standmixer .
0	yes watch out , pls always try to read review before buying . its true the picture is deceiving , but what i do n't understand is why amazon keep using this picture
1	i have made 3 batches with it and everyone has come out perfect . just add the mix water and a packet of brewers yeast and even a small packet of baking yeast will work . its easy no mess and you dont need to add any sugar unlike its lower priced ugly cousin mr beer . the only recomenation i have is when you pour half of it with water then add the mix stir it untill almost disolved then add more water . make sure its alittle warmer then room tempature . alot of it will disolve . then add the yeast and wait about 5 days then put it in the fridge for 10 and it will be perfect
1	this is great ! easy set up , dishwasher safe ( top shelf only ) , and super quiet ( there is a very faint humm ) our cats went right over to check it out . it is kinda big but i expected that from the picture . the only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher . 5 stars ! ! ! i 'd give it more if i could
0	yes , it sits in my drawer and that 's all , it 's only useful if you have a real dread of trace garlic aroma on your fingers . instead i cut off the base of the garlic with a widish knife , then put the flat side of the knife on the garlic and whack it with my fist . it 's so much quicker and easier , the skin comes off no problem , plus crushing garlic releases more flavour than merely slicing it .
1	this was one pattern that both my wife and i could agree on . the design is clean and interesting and should fit with most decors . i purchased two of the 16 piece sets from amazon for $ ... set and with the free vegtable bowles , no tax and free shipping , this was by far the best deal on the internet . my first set arrived with two broken salad plates and one broken dinner plate . my second set arrived with one broken salad plate . the repacement set arrived with one broken salad plate . the vegtable bowles arrived intact . the quality seems to be first rate . no warped plates or design flaws , but a few item did have some minor cosmetic flaws . amazon was great at resolving the damaged goods issues , but needs to seriously rethink the packaging of fragile items . the only fault i could find with this set is that the soup bowles are a little on the small side . i recommend that you read and following the cleaning and maintenance directions and this set should give many years of service
1	the bumble bee is a known sign for qaulity in france . these type of knives are the same ones used in the top restaurants in france and the rest of the world over . there is not a finer steak knife in the world . i have been to the factory and have seen these craftsmen at work . they create perfection
0	2 years ago i purchased these dishes , i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star ... .until 6 months ago . all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half ( these dishes are microwave safe , and no children ) all have broken in the same place ... 2 broke when picking up , 4 have broken while microwaving yet all my cups , bowls , salad , square plates are still in perfect condition.. but without my dinner plates , my set ( s ) are useless ! !

0	we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives . the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them . they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would . i have numerous sharpening stone , ( ceramic , diamond ) and buffing wheels , and sharpened them myself to a razors edge . again they worked well , but soon became very dull . we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance . they are well balanced , looked well made but are over rated and priced . the 2 mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer , take abuse better and sharpen easier .
0	a year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash . the swing-out filter `` hinges '' broke during normal use . once broken , the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed . hence it 's ready for the wastebasket . on closer inspection , the entire filter unit is made of plastic , and the hinges are only a few mm 's in diameter . sturdier design needed !
1	i am a contractor and when i recently remodeled doug and susans basement i was eventually shown how to use the grinder to make espresso while on breaks . unfortunately , i started taking lots of breaks ... good espresso ! the grinder is quiet , precise , and efficient , like an excellent sub contractor , or a good table saw ! the grinder was great . i use a burr grinder at my house but you ca n't even talk over the thing . this one whirs below a conversation level , then stores the suberbly consistant ground coffee . i then pull the lever a couple times to dispense premeasured amounts into the doser that is resting in its holder on the machine , and there it is break is on ! ! thanks for the good times and good espresso . on my way to hawk some of my tools to buy one of these things , it 's worth it
1	i have these sheets on my bed right now . they are very comfortable and soft after just one washing . the price was great and the striping addds style to otherwise bland white sheets
1	the plates are modern and good-looking , always rate compliments from guestts . i would like them more if they were a little bigger
1	i went on a hunt for these glasses for a friend after our having beverages in them in a ( now gone ) bar in nyc . i was delighted to finally find the exact glass at , what i think is , an affordable price for the quality . i bought a set and we ended up `` splitting '' them ( he only wanted/had space for 4 - he lives in a small ! apartment ) . i love them so much i 've now put them on my wishlist . the beautiful clear glass , clean design and impressive heft makes them feel elegant , special and expensive . i 'm *certain* the shape and feel make the single-malt scotch i prefer taste even better ! an excellent value at less than $ 40 for six
1	i love these glasses . i think the traditional stemmed wine glass is fine , but i find this far more practical , while being elegant at the same time . i have the set for sauvignon blanc as well , which are very nice . i 'll be buying more .
0	i bought a haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months . i called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one . i have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing . do not buy anything from this company . their products are cheap chinese junk and they do not stand behind their products . do n't believe me ? look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and zero customer support
1	very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate , this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room . our dog - a rescued border collie - is incontinent , so she can not roam around the house . and while she prefers being outdoors , with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside , in the same room as her family ( instead of out back in the mud room , where her old wire cage was )
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months . at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down . sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down . not what i expect from a $ 70 toaster . well , i have finally given up ( 2 months later ) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon . they are sending me a new one , which i am not sure i am happy about . might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven ... ... ...
1	i 've cleaned my wedding rings and watches with it and am happy with its performance . no , it does not clean as well as the ones at the jewelry store ... nevertheless , it gets the `` in-between '' job done quite nicely
0	i purchased this through amazon but returned it . i intended to use this with their 3qt 10-inch saute pan . but it is huge ! it is not an elegant design for this size pan . all clad should have designed a screen that matches this pan instead of a one-size-fits-all from 8 inches to 13 inches . furthermore , the unique handle that curves over the screen takes more storage room . my wife did n't like it . back to the drawing boards all-clad
1	a good basic place to hang a half dozen jackets or hats . its a little wobbly when loaded but not too bad . easy to assemble and looks ok. a good overall buy .
1	i have had this product for 8 yrs - before the internet ! i make a meal for my husband family every nite could hardly live without this product . it really eliminates the need to wash dry measuring spoons and takes all the hassle out of making dishes with many ingredients - at least you do n't have to get a utensil out for measuring spices . i have had this product in 3 homes ( i 'm a military spouse ) and it has been able to mount under the cabinets in 2 houses thus saving me valuable counterspace cabinet space due to the small kitchens in military housing . i would highly reccommend this to those who like to cook in tight spaces . every move , i just empty the spices run the canister thru the dishwasher , then set out to dry . of course , the labels had started to come off after 7 years so i simply printed out some new `` cutesy '' labels for those spices i constantly measure . as i remember , the labels that came with the package included most every spice you could ever want . money well spent -- 8 yrs ago my hubby bought this for me it has survived a lot of cooking and moves
1	they have the crackle one expects from a percale sheet . refreshing as the snap of a breeze hitting sailing canvas . a man 's kind of sheet
1	this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole . it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees , so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole/soup tureen . handles are sturdy , but short , so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder , but easy to grip with bare hands . because of this feature , you may decide to use this as a serving dish only . good for a large group rather than due to large capacity . we are a family of 2 , so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox
0	many times , i 've come across great deals on amazon where i 've paid just little for a lot . this is not one of those moments . this pan feels like it 's made from three layers of tin foil . it 's shockingly flimsy
1	these bowls are a perfect size for holding one portion . much better than plastic containers that melt in the microwave . i use one almost every day for taking my lunch to work . at $ 2.99 it more than pays for itself every time you use it ( verses buying a take out lunch ) .
1	it 's true , you have to put the whole silly thing together yourself . but that is why it is the price it is . once put together , it is lightweight and easy to move to where you want it . i recommend putting it together on a hard surface . we used a piece of plywood . when you try to put it together on carpet , the mallet does n't enough force to make it work right
0	this is a very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner . if you just need to clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it will perform great . should you actually try to use the beater brush attachment you will be very dissappointed . i bought this cleaner for the purpose of cleaning my curtians and stairs . i own two cats and virtually all of my in-laws are allergic to them . everytime they come , i have to clean the house top to bottom . my upright vacuum ( dirt devil vision lite model 008650 ) weighs a ton and was not designed to use on stairs . i thought this little cleaner might be just the trick . the brush worked great the first several times i used it . but after about 20 uses it began to slow down . i cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw the initial performance again . eventually , it stopped working at all . i urge you to buy something else , if the beater brush is a selling point for you
1	this is the best - snaps on easily , cleans easily works just great . our cats love to pull out the grass just like they were outside . they love it and it is a great conversation piece just like the drinkwell . our cats are truly spoiled !
1	i already had a cake lifter . when i visited my daughter and her husband at christmas , they were lifting a coffee cake out of the oven using two small spatulas . i knew how much easier it would have been with the cake lifter so i wanted to get one for them . googled spatulas and was amazed at how many there were . finally found one just like mine and ordered two of them - one for each daughter . i have given one hers and she was delighted . will give the other one hers when i visit in march . i use mine often and am glad to have it - do n't believe enough people know there is such an item on the market . too bad it is n't sold more widely
1	i really bought these measuring spoons to match the michael graves measuring cups that i was planning to buy , and i am sure glad that i did . the are the easiest to use measuring spoons that i have ever used . the unique handles seem just right . you can use them equally well with either hand . it seemed with the dipper type spoons that i previously used i was always changing hands , and the spoon was always in th wrong hand . with these you can forget that . you can tell the size of each of them just by looking at them , but i wish that they would have embossed the sizes all a little larger and painted them white . black on black is hard to see , especially when the numbers are so small
0	do not bother to buy this sewing machine case . it is crappy ! do n't be fooled by the `` universal '' phrase of this product . i have a brother sewing machine so i bought this item . when i got it , i placed my sewing machine and i rattles around inside the case . i do n't see what is so `` universal '' about this . there is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case . it 's terrible ! ! ! i 'd give no star but i do n't have that choice on the selection . i wanted to return it but it 's not worth the shipping charge that will incure on my refund due to amazon 's policies . by then i would probably only get at most $ 12.00 back in refunds
1	i received this set packed very well , no scratches , no broken pieces so i have no complaints . the color is beautiful and the dishes are durable .
0	the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day ... since the police wo n't do anything about it , i bought this bark free ... hahaha ... what a joke ... the darn dog barked more ... anyway ... it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money ...
1	these sheets were the color , size , and quality described . however , if you tend to roll over , instead of picking yourself up when you turn over while sleeping ... your sheets will very quickly begin to ball . yes , those tiny little balls you get on the clothes you wear . within about 6 - 8 weeks , the sheets have balls on the areas were the most friction happens . they are otherwise great sheets ... but they do n't act like egyptian cotton . they are thick , warm , but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill ( soft twill , mind you ) , but they do n't feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets i paid more money for . pay for the real thing if you want soft , non-balling sheets
0	i ordered this item and received several notices postponing its delivery . eventually , i cancelled my order because more than a month has gone by , and still , no table and chairs
0	we travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we 're sleeping . the materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence . the main body is plastic . the metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door . the serrations on the bar are not deep , so do n't promise much strength . while none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in , this one , while prettily-designed is overly expensive and unimpressive . we 're going to try a few others . by the way , in returning this item , which we consider unsatisfactory , amazon will charge us doubly : the cost to return the item to amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our `` super saver '' shipping . the end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer
1	what a great masterpiece ! this beautiful salt and pepper shaker set is an attractive , useful set . great to use for bright rooms ! cheery color- even the pepper will brighten your day
0	these refills are ridiculous . yes , they are simple to use , but the maximum life span is about two weeks . i 've gone through at least 6 sets of refills this winter season already , and the results are consistent . i run the vornado humidifier 24/7 , as recommended by the manufacturer and clean it regularly , especially when changing out the wicks . there is never any gunky build-up to blame the short life-span on . these are clearly manufactured to last only two weeks . my ancient duracraft , which is no longer manufactured , but is the best humidifier i 've ever had , easily goes 4 to 6 weeks between wick filter changes , with no deterioration in performance . this will be the last year i use the vornado ... for next year i 'll be purchasing a second air-o-swiss , which runs like a dream , but is quite pricey up front
1	we have 2 airedale terriers ( 55-lb dogs ) and 2 cats . i originally bought a scat-mat as a deterrent to the cats , but it has since become a dog deterrent . one of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we 're not at home . this is the only deterrent that has proven effective . it keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down ( as she 'll keep getting shocked if she stands there ) . i feel comfortable using the product , as i have been shocked by it many times myself ( generally i step on it by accident in the middle of the night ) . make no mistake , it hurts , and you do n't want to have it happen , but it certainly is n't bad enough that i feel cruel using it . this is my second scat mat , as the other one stopped working . because of that , i 'm a bit concerned about the durability , especially considering the cost . that said , however , the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last ( no wires going to the battery that may become detached ) , so i am hopeful that this one will last longer . either way , however , it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money .
1	this pillow looks simple enough , but there must have been a lot of research put into inventing it ! the dogbone ( medium size , about 16 '' w -- i do n't remember specific dimensions ) instantly relieved many aches i had in my neck without forcing me to lie down in a flat position ( which often gives me a headache and makes it impossible to read while lying down ) . i 'd been to the doc quite a few times for the back/neck problems i 've had lately , but no rx worked quite as well as this delightful cushion . my only issues with it are cleaning ( stuffing 's packed very tight , so i 'd rather not try it out in the washer for fear of mold/mildew ; i spray it with disinfectant every once in a while instead ) the outer material ( an optional moisture-wicking or allergen-reducing pillowcase would be nice ) . however , i bought it based on earlier reviews , and i do n't regret it
1	the belt was received very quickly and we were very satisfied with it . donna wilso
0	thinking this would be an excellent gift for mr. electronics geek/light sleeper , it became a pretty big joke ( and embarassment for me ) because some of the sounds that come out of this thing sound like a circus or a dying speak n ' spell . do n't bother - buy the sound screens used in medical offices , etc . for half the price . they 're so much better
0	this product does work and produces great tasting water -- for a while . i thought maybe we 'd done something to make it leak , but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time ( approx 8 months ) . there 's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks , and then eventually squirts water all over the place . there is no way to fix it . we wo n't be buying this brand again .
0	this is a $ 30 `` ice crusher '' whose instructions advise inserting just one cube at a time . even at that ludicrous rate , the machine occasionally jammed . i threw it out , went to target and bought a $ 20 waring blender that has an ice chopping mode . it works beautifully , even with a dozen cubes at once
0	i initially bought this coffeemaker because i remembered my dad 's sunbeam silex type coffeemaker . it made great coffee and so does the bodum . problem with the bodum is that i had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material . the folks at bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem . i am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if i continue to have a problem
1	have owned the jura capresso e8 since july of 2006 . have made over 750 coffees since that day . heavy entertaining and daily latte 's bring value to the machine . machine has responded well under all circumstances . only problem thus far has been with the frother which would jam from the froth to steam position . contacted capresso and the expressed a new attachment . have had no additional issues with machine thus far . excellent crema and good temperature for espresso . ( warm the expresso cups before hand ) as with other machines i have owned , experimentation with coffee to milk ratio takes some time . once determined the machine makes a consistent brew each time . have run cleaning cycles and filter changes when prompted . machine really is super-automatic . the machine informs you when water is needed , when beans need to be filled and when grounds need to be emptied . would recommend the machine without hesitation . should this change i will update the review .
1	i recieved this rack for christmas and i love it it looks great and my 4 year old daughter likes to use it too the only thing i do n't like is that it only holds 50 dvds and 2 racks look nice but any more than that is gon na look dumb i also like that the drawers pull out and sit on top for easy viewing
1	the kitchen odors were getting very bad . we realized that the filter had never been changed . it is an old recirculating system over the stove . finding filters is for the birds . filters are all listed by a serial or code number . i think the psychology is that you use only the filter from the original manufacturer . after looking at many different types of filters , these seemed to be cutable-is that a word ? we did not need to cut , they fit into the nutone range hood perfectly . our nutone hood is so old that we could not find anything listed on the nutone site . so these fit , the house odor while cooking is diminished . what is not clear is how often they should be replaced . obviously when the smell gets worse , but i have no idea if 6 months or 6 years . will buy more , cheaper than a new hood
0	i received this blender for x-mas last year . it has some nice design features ( good heavy base to prevent tipping , measuring cup built into the cap ) . however , i experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender does n't do well with anything thick like milkshakes . it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly , forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart . while it worked ok for a while , the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months
1	for the money you ca n't beat this duve
1	after reading the other reviews , i almost reconsidered my purchase . however , the juicer works great - as long as you follow a few tips . 1 ) make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on tight ! check once , then check again . 2 ) do n't use the paper filters , particularly if you are juicing in quantity . once i threw mine in the trash , the balancing issues went away immediately . it makes clean up a little harder , but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use , it 's not a big deal . 3 ) if the item being juiced wo n't go through , be patient , and pulse-push it in . do n't cram it with the pusher . my only concern is that when you juice quantities , so much pulp sticks to the side it 's hard for all of the juice out to strain out . it 's best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice . using the above tips - i expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time
0	unsatisfied . never received the item.. waited 8 wks before canceling order . purchased item at macy '
0	a 1/3 inch split developed in the wood on the spoon 's flat edge after about five uses ( i hand wash and dry promptly ) . the same thing happened to the replacement amazon sent . amazon-great ! ! mario batali- not so great
1	we have had one of these grinders for over 15 years . it was always the best and easiest to use . simple to change grind size , easy to fill and the side turn gives excellent leverage when grinding . we broke the top and kept it in place with duct tape - not real pretty . we were so happy to find the same grinder and now have two
1	i bought the machine about 2 weeks ago and it took me about 5 min to read the instructions and use the machine . sorry , but one would have to be an idiot not to understand how to use it . i love its versatility , e.g . espresso coffee or pods , regular water or add bottle ( for those whose tap water is bad ( comes with an adapter ) ) , froth maker for capuccino or steam water for tea . it sure will draw wows from your friends . as long as you remember to run a cup of water through before each time you use it , your espresso should be the perfect temperature . took me some time to realize why it was lukewarm . the only bad thing ( why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars ) i have to say about the granos is that in order to remove the portafilter , i.e the part with the handle holding the coffee , you have to use force . but maybe after a few months it will loosen up a bit and things will be easier . all in all i am completely satisfied with its user-friendliness , crema , temperature , and versatility .
0	crystal d'arques longchamp wine glass has 10.25oz , 8.25oz,5.75oz , 4oz , 2oz , 5 different size . they are all look a like and ca n't tell by picture . i 'm looking for my missing set of 5.75oz . i ca n't buy them without size information .
1	i bought this exact same slicer 20 years ago for my mom and it has lasted . it 's a unique item that guests love and it 's easy to clean up as well
0	packaged with four left legs ( requires two left , two right ) one briquette grate is smaller than the other and falls to bottom as a result . had to drill / elongate hole to install grate support bracket paint on handles started to run when i handled them with wet hands . i tried to rinse off the remaining paint or ink under running water so that it will not continue to bleed off . what paint do you know of that rinses off under plain water ? right cast iron grate cracked when it came in contact with heat . the design and construction of this product shows clear disregard for the consumer and is absolutely unacceptable at any price . i have to question at this point weather or not the paint used on the grill and grates is toxic or lead based . i 've come across my share of junk but this is really bad !
0	unless you look like popeye and/or have the ability to rip phone books in half with your bare hands , you will struggle to wring this mop out . even if you can move the wringer , the handle sections slide apart . i spent more time putting it back together and cursing than actually cleaning the floor
0	i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets . these blankets are of really cheap quality . thin , mesh-like texture . threads get loose at the ends . leaving traces of fabric everywhere . i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies
0	i only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on ( not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on ) , caused the inner lid seal to break . the lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced . now i have to deal with seeing if amazon will help me replace the unit , even though i already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago . i would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit , due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein
1	since i have been pleased with my t-fal pressure cooker , i purchased this pan based on the quality of craftsmanship . i like this pan for frying . its stainless steel with the thick aluminum heat diffuser bottom makes it robust ( it is warp free ) . other aluminum pans tend to warp over time . the nonstick surface seems to be less prone to scratches . however , i always recommend non metallic utensils for piece of mind . the center heat indicator is helpful to know when it 's ready .
1	it 's small enough to fit in my little kitchen . it works as advertised . the waffles were fast to make . clean up is easy . hardly any needed . i made mine very light ( folded in whipped egg whites after the batter was all mixed up . ) i can imagine making these heart shaped waffles for dessert
0	i purchased this bonjour frother to replace my old aerolatte frother . the difference between the two brands is startling ! the bonjour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually over-froths the milk . this causes the bubbles to keep breaking down . i can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it wo n't last long . on the othe hand , the aerolatte frothers ( also widely available with several models on amazon ) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create . i 'm buying another aerolatte and will use the bonjour wand for things that do n't need thick foam ( like mixing salad dressing )
1	i must admit i 'm really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is . only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is it 's still too early as i 've only had it for a month or so , and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it 's been given . we have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home , and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week . along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with , and so far there has been no problem . i highly recommend this little guy , and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place . one suggestion though . wonder how long it 'll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model . that way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode .
1	love it ! rechargeable , seems to last better than battery operated ones . the design has improved too . i have had two of them . i love how you can dismantle this one so it wo n't break if packed away.makes good froth too .
0	i should have read the other review more closely . this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights . i expected more for over $ 50 . if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
1	we received the zephyr as a wedding gift . ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo . the handle on ours is brass instead of chrome . it heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup-o-noodle . much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there . my wife and i are very pleased with this tea kettle
0	poor suction , air filter cloggs every time and it shuts down after 15 min use . dont buy ...
1	it really does make a difference when some of the chlorine is filtered out of your coffee ( and even more so in your bourbon ) water , but these filters are a rip off price-wise . it 's hard to believe braun would n't make money selling them at a third of the price
0	i find it hard to give this even a 1-star . given the price , i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers . here 's why i am sorely disappointed : 1 ) the stainless steel does in fact rust and corrode 2 ) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains , no openings , so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates , and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew 3 ) check your water softness , because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly
0	its an oven timer , right ? so why is it made out of cheap plastic that can melt ? the first time it was used was also the last time it was used because it was left on top of the oven while i baked a batch of cookies . the heat from the oven melted the back of the timer . good thing i also used the timer on the oven clock as a back up or i may have had to pitch the timer and the cookies . even if this product were free , i would not use one
0	the concept here is good `` no tools needed '' to install . the product itself is well made , but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to , the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it . if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better . i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down
1	good fabric and nice size . great for the price , free
1	well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it . not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic .
0	the temperature settings for the alarm are preset and can not be manually changed . so if you cook your food using the alarm , you can over cook it , horribly over cook it , or turn it into a cinder
0	the image in this product is misleading . it looks like this product contains more than 1 piece , but when i opened it i got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior
1	i use this mug a lot for chicken noodle and other soups as well as salads . its easy to clean up and to handle . i like having the lid with the pop top so its does n't make a mess in the microwave . i fits easily in the tote bag when commuting to work . i highly recommend it ! !
0	will work fine if you only use a few light coats . not designed for a family of four in a colder region . it 's now proped up in the corner as it has lost two leggs and half it 's hooks . now shopping for a new one . looked nice in the oak
0	giving 2 stars on the suction alone . hepa filter does n't self-clean/turn after one use . a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you do n't pay very close attention to aligning it just right . i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it 's heavy and dirt just falls out , a lot of dirt , when emptying the dirt box . i 'm returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience
0	i 've bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories , and found them to be sturdy , remarkably well designed , and easy to use . unfortunately , this timer is an exception . it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point : clock plus timer , ten number keys for input , memory , etc . but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers , it 's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer . it 's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom . the problem is the display . it 's horrible . for three reasons : first , the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer i 've seen . they 're about 1/4 '' high , half or less the size of those on comparable timers . second , the numbers are recessed 1/8 '' or more beneath a clear plastic cover , not on the surface -- it 's dark in there and feels like looking down a well . it desperately needs a backlight , but there is none . unless the light source is shining directly into the display , there 's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers . but that causes the third problem : the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective , and it 's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there is n't a reflection shining back into your eyes . the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer , the light source , and myself into a position where i can read the small , dark , shadowed , and reflective display . not what i need when i 'm trying to cook . it 's just not worth it . since i have several other timers with displays i do n't have to strain to read , i use this one as a paperweight . i 'd have to say it works very well . i just do n't understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door
0	this canister vac might be ok for very light duty , but do n't expect it to handle any `` real '' housecleaning . the filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating , which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot . if i had it to do over again , i would not purchase this vac . i would save up and buy a better canister vacuum
1	who needs the high tech stuff ? this little frother could n't be better ! it works killer within seconds ! it even works on my soymilk ! i 'm so impressed
0	coffeemaker just quit yesterday makes cold coffee now unable too use . got a three year warranty and lasted three months . biggest waste of money yet . now call customer service get a busy signal last 15 minutes . never buy another hamilton beach product .
0	i bought this to avoid buing and expensive mandoline to make my sweet potato fries . what i leared is ... the sweet potatoes are too hard for this cutter to work well . neither my husband or i could get the sweet potato to cut . we had to take it out and chop them by hand . it works very good on regular and smaller potatoes though
1	item shipped lightening fast ! in perfect condition ! just as describe
0	i bought this coffee maker because of its compact size , but returned it a week later . i found it very difficult to avoid spillage when pouring the water into the coffee maker and the coffee into a cup . the problem was worse if making more than 4 cups . another problem was the taste of the coffee . i like my coffee full of flavor . i have been using drip coffee makers for several years and think i know how to get the coffee `` just right '' . but , every carafe of coffee from this tasted weak , and much too hot , almost scalding !
0	i was very impressed with the infomercials on this product and was about to buy the set before i read a very detailed and thorough online review at http : //www.epinions.com/content_180924944004 . the reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product . among her pet peeves : * things do stick to the product - use a flour cooking spray for better results . * odors do stay with the product * not easy to clean - the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps . * size of the pieces are small * the pieces are so flexible that if you do n't place the food neatly in the pan , you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results . * you can slice through the product easily . * guarantee is shakey at best * and so on ... .. there are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light . and more importantly , i personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis . i for one , definitely will not buy this product . please consider this recap of another 's review a public service . buyer beware
0	i am totally unimpressed with this set of bowls . i received them a few days ago and washed them , and one has already managed to crack after falling of the drying rack and into the sink . a melamine bowl should be far sturdier than this . the orange measuring cup/bowls towards the center are nice , but the outer bowls are rather flimsy .
0	i ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback . we followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee . after that the machine said `` ventilate '' . we followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself . went to make another cup of coffee and it said `` ventilate '' . this time it would not fix itself . i tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray . turn off the knob and `` ventilate '' comes back up on the screen . turn the machine off and turn it back on , `` ventilate '' came up on the screen . we called amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later ( thank you amazon ) . unfortunately , this one i did not get cup one out of the machine . it read `` ventilate '' as soon as i turned it on . the difference is with this one no water would come out at all . gaggia provides no customer support so you are on your own with this unit
0	be aware before you order ! on oct. 31 , 2006 i ordered two cases of bottles through amazon , to be delivered from stacks and stacks . when they arrived , the cases were only 16 count instead of 48 count . i called stacks and stacks and a supervisor was to return my call , i received an email instead ( supervisor claimed my home number was a fax ) . she offered to credit me shipping cost ( $ 18.47 for the heavier weight boxes - the 16 count boxes are only 5.99 to ship ) if i wanted to keep the boxes , otherwise they would arrange to pick them up . she claimed that j.k. adams does not make a 48 ct case . i responded that i wished to return the boxes ( i had less than half of the bottles i needed , and the cost per bottle was now more than doubled ) . i have since written two more times and as of 11/16/06 have received no response , no instructions to return , and no credit to my account . i have filed a claim with amazon a-z guarantee , hopefully this will be resolved soon
1	i bought this for my boyfriend for his `` man 's room '' ... .he loves it ! it keeps beer cold and it looks great
0	this vacuum cleans reasonably well , but i have a few significant gripes which will prevent me from buying a similar model when making my next vacuum purchase , which seems to about every 2 years . i 've finally decided that we may go with an `` heirloom '' vacuum next time , such as an oreck , since the lifetime of any sub $ 100 vacuum is just ridiculous . my complaints : 1 . this thing screams like a banshee ! it is indeed light , and reasonably powerful , but it literally hurts my ears to use it in small rooms . it does not roar , it emits a relatively high pitched scream . i have had big , small , and medium size vacuums , and this thing easily is louder than all of them . i haev a 2 1/2 horsepower shop vac which is much quieter than this vacuum . 2 . wheels barely extend below the bottom of the vacuum , so it requires a bit of effort to roll over anything but very short carpet . wheeling from room to room , say over hardwood while tipping the vacuum back , also can not really be done . 3 . the filter is hard to clean , as it has a flange that extends down over maybe 1/3 of one side . i often have to stick my finger in the space between the filter and the flange to get a significant amount of gunk out . gross . tell me how this is better than a bag
0	my last one ( same model ) was good . this one , the auto shut-off just buzzes and does n't shut off
1	my 82 year old aunt can now open a wine bottle because the vacu vin requires minimal physical strength -- the only i have found that is so easy to use except for bench models
1	this lovely salad set will be a great addition to any lunch or dinner setting . the serving bowl is much larger than i anticipated -- and great for tossing space . the individual bowls are also deep . this is a great set for salad lovers
1	apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new s5 series of miele vacuum cleaners , the features , price , and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models , nor even across series . many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones . they have fancy names like capricorn , red velvet , and champagne , leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car . if your browser has tabbed browsing ( e.g. , firefox ) , the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele 's website and open a tab for each model you 're interested in . flip back and forth to see what text changes . callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series ( newest technology motor ? ) that still comes with an electronically powered brush ( the 4th pisces model is turbo ) . after 3 months of extensive use : pros : agility - the 10 ½ '' wide seb217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard , and one of the reasons i chose this model . for me , smaller is better . while other vacuums advertise large 13 '' power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe , i do n't have much open carpet space . coffee tables , chairs , weight benches , and computers , all need vacuuming around and under . the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners . brush duster - the most commonly used attachment ( for me ) , the brush duster is also small ( slightly larger in diameter than the hose ) and the bristles are durable . it 's angled by default , but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out . this is not mentioned anywhere ; you just have to figure this out for yourself . on low power , i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before , like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires . i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk . parquet floor brush - initially , i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included , but this `` wider brush duster '' actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush . the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets , but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better . on the negative side , you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust , and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for `` genuine horse bristles '' . there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush , so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts do n't get separated for life ( the powerbrush takes precedence ) . cord rewind - the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time , something like 15 for 15 times ! ( the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat . ) cons : price - after all , it 's just a vacuum cleaner . there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s5 series , at least when i bought this . everywhere i checked ( maybe 10 websites ) , the price was exactly $ 799 or $ 799.95 , with the only difference being no tax and/or free shipping . one website even advertised `` the lowest price allowed ! '' what 's a diamond dealer ? is this amway ? release buttons - the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive , being on the part that `` comes off '' rather than on the part that `` stays behind '' . therefore , you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with . the hose extension button is particularly confusing . it 's an oval shaped rocker button that `` rocks '' very little . to extend the stainless steel hose , you have to remember which side of the button ( top or bottom ) to press . there is no distinction on which side to press , and it 's always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button . stiff no swivel hose - the hose rotates at the top ( handle area ) , but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine . instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists , i 'd rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists . the flex hose diameter is larger than i 'm used to , making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner . considering the price , an electrical slip ring would have been nice . bag full indicator - the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck . put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full . right out of the box on short carpet , it indicated bag full on high power . as i turned the power down , it indicated less full sequentially . you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator . even at that , there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator . extra stuff ? - the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose ( button does n't easily click into place ) . the extension is n't needed to connect the parquet brush , so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it . to this day , i still have n't figured out what the extension is for , other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future . this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life ( along with the parquet brush , `` normal '' filter cage , and replacement bags ) . symbol marking - the power symbol markings are not obvious at all , contrary to claims . other than the symbols labels `` min '' and `` max '' , you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean . at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise . the quite mode is # 4 of 6 settings ( with 6 being the highest ) , and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the `` normal '' operating mode . i think most people will consider `` max '' the default mode . optional filter frame - this model comes with a hepa filter , so you do n't need the filter frame unless you 're going to switch to the `` normal '' filters , but brand-new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle , apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping . you do n't even need the handle for the frame to function properly , but for the kind of money i paid , nothing should be broken out of the box . the vendor that i bought it from ( best vacuum ) replaced it for free . so is it worth $ 800 ? it does a good job , but only time will tell..
0	makes good coffee but grinder lid breaks very often and has to be replaced . since the lid is costly to replaced we bought a separate krups grinder . cusinart does't answer e-mails about the problem . look at the number of recondition makers for sale and draw your own conclusions
0	i bought this power mop for my daughter for christmas , and it broke the first time she used it
1	this platter is much nicer than i was expecting , larger too . the glaze technique really looks beautiful on this piece and it will make a nice addition to my table setting . it is well made without being overly heavy it came well packaged and arrived only 3 days after i placed my order with the free shipping . thanks amazon for having the companion pieces i ca n't seem to find in any department store
1	i really enjoy cooking in this pot . it has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes . the enamel surface is wonderful . i love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family . the only drawback is how heavy the pot is , but that does n't change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen !
1	i received the food mill promptly , and in perfect condition . it was as stated by the seller
0	they take batteries but do n't last 15 minutes . they have an ac spot for and adapter but where do you plug a undercounter light in under the counter . hate them
0	this item comes with many warnings as it should . it can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet . the product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house
1	these are nice quality sheets but i was a little disappointed..i was expecting them to feel more satiny .
1	its a great product ! good quality . not enough velco ( sp ) for the bumpers , my bulldog takes them right off
0	streaks and scratched the front of my dishwasher . does a very poor job .
1	we have owned the breadman corner bakery for about eight months now . it has made our house smell wonderful . i have to say i do n't use the recipes that came with it , so i wo n't judge those . for the price this is a beautiful machine . the pan has a solid heft to it , not like some of the other bread makers with seemingly flimsy aluminum pans . we have made many types of bread in it and have even churned butter from heavy cream . the best kind of bread is the one made in the pan right after making butter . with a toddler and a baby , it is nice not to have to run to the store everyday to buy fresh bread or rolls . the only time our bread has turned out not so good is when an ingredient has been forgotten . without the yeast it was n't quiet the same but our house smelled great
0	after about 10 days from date of purchase , only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle . i would have to push the on button , get another 2 cups . after 5 or 6 tries i would finally get all 8 cups through . the design is bad for left handed people . it 's very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate . the lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and i would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid . overall not a good design . i got my money back and am bought a hamilton beach brewstation which i think is a great coffemaker .
0	the high-tech commercial cooking surface began to come off at the third use of this griddle . i do n't know what evenheat means in their product description , but this griddle has a hot spot on the left side . i 'm in the market for a new griddle , but i wo n't buy anything labeled broilking again
1	just got it as a add on to an order and found that my cats really liked it . all you have to do is open the bag and they come a runnin
0	in the twentieth century , and before , cast iron pans had the size stamped on them which told you the diameter of the cooking surface . twenty-five years ago i bought the lodge 10sk which is a 12 '' skillet with a 10 '' inside cooking diameter . ok. with this skillet marked 14sk the inside cooking surface is only 12 '' and it should be marked 12sk . they deceptively flared out the sides to get an overall top diameter of 15 1/4 '' as a selling point . this is n't very helpful to my pork chops being 36 % less space than i thought i was buying . i 'd watch out for the 10sk too . i guess to get a real # 14 cast iron skillet , i need to get a griswold . hilditch ps : it weighs 10 lbs
1	this is a great product . it really holds a lot and is great for stoups ( thicker than soup but thinner than stews ) and can hold meats like a pork tenderloin quite easily
0	i 'm not sure the timer i receib=ved works properly . the timing mechanism dseems accurate , however , the sound it makes when the time is up is more like a `` ticking '' . if you are nor right near it , you 'll never hear it
1	i looove this mug . its such a beautiful shade of red , very nice looking . also , these mugs are huge . one of mine already has a chip on it , but i 'll leave that to certain people in my house being very clumsy .
0	very disappointed with this fan . failed within six months of purchasing . do n't buy a lasko fan
1	the sheets matched perfectly with my room , which is the main reason i purchased them . the quality is great ! the sheets are very soft and the colors are amazing . i would recommend this product to anyone . the reversability is also a nice luxury . it was a wonderul purchase
1	if you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner , then you will love this one . i bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large ( and heavy ) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair . because of the small bagless chamber , you have to empty it frequently , so i would n't count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner . i wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs , specifically to pick up pet hair , and this vacuum exceeded my expectations . i tried the shark , a similar model made by fantom , and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does ( stay away from the fantom cordless - by far the worst ! ! ) . i do n't think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did . overall , this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean-ups or to maintain pet-hair free area rugs . one suggestion - use the carpet setting even on bare floors . the brushes are high enough so they wo n't scratch bare floors , but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush . i found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless i used the carpet setting . the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying .
0	i have watched emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter . i just dismissed it as part of emeril 's shtick until i bought this machine for myself . the first time i tried to use it with any liquid ingredients ( making mayonnaise ) , it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl . the top is just flawed in its design , as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl . i suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that ka did , much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews ( e. g. consumer reports and cook 's illustrated ) . in any case , this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry ( they blow through the badly designed joint as well ) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter , the outside of the bowl , the bottom of the machine , and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do . i will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the cuisinart i have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard .
1	nice machine for doing quick clean-ups , stairs and car . a bit heavy but great suction . not thrilled with the method in which the hose for accessories is hooked up but a small price to pay for a good job . worth the minor frustration
1	if you are terrible at making rice as i am , this is a very helpful product . the liquid tends to boil over if cooked at high temp in my microwave . i cook the rice at 50 % power for about 50 % longer than the directions recommend and it comes out perfectly . easy clean up in the dishwasher . it is a bit of a pain to store , but i 'd buy it again . also comes with a steamer insert for cooking vegetables , etc . but i have n't tried that yet
0	bought this model . would not brew a full cup of coffee no matter what i did . called customer service and they sent me a new one . this one also did not work . all it did was flash blue lights and never brewed a cup . tossed it out and bought a different model by black and decker . have had it for months and never had a problem with the new model
1	those sheets are so sweet . i bought them in several colors . it 's a dream to sleep in them
0	first one came cracked , second one came chipped . gave up
1	i got a good deal on this and it turned out to much better than expected . well made with a sharp edge that holds up . the only reason for a 4 is the handle is not the most comfortable or secure grip .
1	i had a regular incandescent book like in the same format with the light on an extendable arm . lasted a good while but the bulb finally went and i could n't find a good replacement . i saw the triple led book light and knew right away that it would be perfect . i looked at a lot of lights and nothing compares to this . you get great light that you can direct exactly where you need it . and it only uses aaa batteries ! defintely gets the 5 star rating
0	no stars ! i recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated , but due to the `` leaking '' issues w/ the filter basket overflowing , you may also notice that the water never completely drains-staying at the 2 cup line-causing mold milldew to grow ( despite proper cleaning maintenance ) . this is the reason for the `` bad tasting coffee '' also the reason for my current various medical conditions ... i am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues i am being faced with . please do not purchase any mr. coffee/sunbeam products ... this is the exact model i own , but nearly every model , has the same defective construction consumer complaints ... check the better business bureau consumer affairs ... you will be shocked at what you find about mr. coffee/sunbeam . they have almost gone bankrupt from class action lawsuits , more than once . if anyone has a similar situation with any mr. coffee brand coffee makers , please contact me asap ... my email address is angidougherty @ yahoo.com people are suffering because of this hazardous product may not even know it ... toxic mold poisoning is very serious can be deadly . especially through drinking it in your morning coffee . yum
1	this new toaster from kitchen aid is an excellent little toaster , and includes a special setting for bagel 's as well as settings for frozen items like toaster waffels . i love mine and tell everyone in my family they should have one . if your looking for a new toaster you can not fine a better one than this model from kitchen aid
0	i have been very disappointed in this product . if i could return them , i would . i purchased this product because a friend of mine has some polycarbonate wine glasses which she has had for several years and that still look like new . she even washes them in the dishwasher . i have only had these for about 6 weeks and have only used them about 4-5 times . each time i have hand washed them , but they are very cloudy and i am embarrassed to use them . i would not recommend them
1	after failing to find a simple , easy to use travel clock in local stores i decided to search online and got this one . even though it 's inexpensive , the craftmanship is n't shoddy : all the parts fit together well and are easy to adjust . parts of it glow in the dark ( including the hands , number marks , and pop-up part that lets you know that you set the alarm ) . it 's very quiet and does n't take up much space . if only more things in life were like this great little clock
1	recently purchased this in mid-2006 and it is the best cookware item i have ever owned and used . as one of those millions who rely on mid-line priced discount department store brands , i can state with 100 % certainty i was amazed ( and still am ) with the high-performance this item offers ! the clean-up is still a dream-come-true , all i have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse , it practically cleans itself . my burners are all equal size ( gas stove ) and highest setting is `` 6 '' i have learned all i have to do for pancakes is level 3 ! ! cooking bacon , an entire pound , is no problem for this cookware . i do want to purchase more of this item , there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available . i 'm even thinking of slowly switching to this brand `` all-clad '' nonstick
0	i bought this coffeemaker 6 weeks ago and the burner plate is pealing.i also discovered after i had water and coffee grounds all over , that you have to place the carafe with the handle to the side slightly or it will not drip properly.hopefully , i can get my money back , and try another bran
0	i ordered some replacement batteries and was told that they would be here last wednesday . it is now thursday of the next week . i have emailed them and told them to email me or call me to let me know where my package is and to no affail , no call . i will never order from petsafe again ! !
1	great product , too bad the shipping cost as much as the produc
1	for big birds , rib roasts , etc. , you need a long knife to get a clean even slice . this knife delivers . it has great lines , and a ballanced feel . the forged blade is thin and flexible , yet still drives from the handle . the blade follows your directions well , and does n't wander during a cut . a real gem with top quality construction . i 'm a big fan of three rivet durability , but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that i chose them for the last three knives i purchased . blade for blade , these knives are the best around . at this price , you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years
0	i received my granos as a birthday present two years ago . as had already been reported here , the machine is great -- when it works . i thought i was the only one who had leak problems but most everyone who wrote a review here reported the same problem . leak from the bottom and leak from the water container . i called customer service to report the problem and they sounded like they 've never heard of the problem . they asked me to return the machine but i did n't bother . a good customer service should have already heard the problem before customers call . a $ 600 espresso machine should last more than two years . i ca n't believe a company like bodum is not concerned about its product . i 'm buying another espresso machine and it 's not going to be bodum again
1	i just love this garlic roaster , it roasts up to 3 med . size bulbs of garlic in less than 30 min . i like the idea of a mini roaster so i do not have to heat up my convection oven for such a small quanity of garlic . it is easy to clean and has great appeal in the kitchen . it has an automatic light and lets you know when roasting is complete . it cooks to perfection while lightly roasting the garlic ( top facing down ) and i like to use a cloth to handle the hot garlic and squeeze them into my mashed potatoes , if you allow the garlic to cool off , the cloves firm up and are great eaten with a desert fork . i use spanish roja garlic in this roaster and it comes out perfect every time . i have used this machine for 5 months now and have since purchased another one as a gift
0	i ordered this cereal dispenser for my adult son . he filled it with raisin bran . when he turned the knob to release the cereal into a bowl , the flakes of cereal broke up . some missed the bowl and went on the floor . he 's going to try putting cheerios in it to replace the raisin bran . if it does n't work well with the cheerios , i plan to return the item
0	nice looking , but not easy to move . the bar at the top is n't smooth and it hurts if you try to move the stool with one hand . also , it arrived with the top plastic piece broken on one side . disappointed . not worth the trouble of returning
0	i was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for xmas . however , if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs , i wo n't be using it often . the literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre-seasoned , and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat . on the first try i had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots , though i was able to get it to release with a pancake turner . the scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off , even with soaking for awhile . on the second try i oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread , so as to not have any bare spots . i still had sticking ! ditto for clean up . this thing weighs a ton , too . it is awkward to transfer off the burner ; the instructions warn `` lift , do not slide '' on a glass top stove . i think i 'll continue to use my non-stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press . that always works great !
1	i consider myself a space heater pro . i have tried so many heaters and only this one , this year , has been worthy of a review . buy this heater . i love it so much that i bought two more when i loaned my original to my sister : ) it is great . the tower has two heat options that are fantastic . it heats the whole room if you need it to . a must have for chilly nights
0	i bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy . i then bought one for my daughter . she used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit . the blade assembly as per other reviews . it is going to cost about $ 50 . to repair . now mine is smelling . i am using my old 15 year old oster and it is still working . also to my surprise it is doing a better job . just not as pretty . i have ka stand mixer , hand blender , food processors large and small , emersion blender and attachments for all . love all of them . will buy other ka but not this again
1	works great . bought for making candle tarts and it did n't let me down . i would recommend this hot plate for any use
0	i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best . only problem is that they rust ! ! ! i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior . i do n't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot , so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times . the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so , but any serious tea drinker like me knows that 's unrealistic . i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money did n't last long at all . i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i 'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot
0	i have owned this vacuum for 2 years . it was great at first . now , with a 3 level house , it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat . i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it . the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace . if i had to do it all over again , i 'd buy something else . invest more in a better vacuum- not this one
1	i bought this as a gift for my husband-after reading a hundred reviews made my choice . this little machine does n't do anything fancy- it grinds beans-we have n't used it for anything else since we bought it to grind beans . it does a great job-it 's easily put together , nothing spills , it 's easily used-not much else to say
0	this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use . it removes the air with a fan . there is air left in the bag , it does n't create a vacuum . the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid . the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag . i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags . they are thinner than ziploc bags . you can not use canisters with this one
0	this is a great idea , but i think it might need more tweaking . the reservoir holds a lot of water , which is good , but there is no filter . so any cat hair , stray food , or whatever your 18-month-old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl . then it sits there , usually after sinking to the bottom , until you dig it out . also , with mine at least , you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear . a shame , since the cat really did like the few bubbles i was able to coax out . if this somehow filtered the water and made bubbles , i 'd be all over it ( like cat hair on a pastel couch )
1	how did this technology elude me for so many years ? after spending decades of trying to `` bring the butter up to room temp '' by , variously , taking it out hours before i needed to use it , placing it on the warm radiator , zapping it in the microwave , or putting it in a dish of hot water , finally i 've found a way to keep the butter spreadable and fresh ! few kitchen aids are as useful as this one . i would rank this up there in the top-ten list along with my 8 '' wusthof blade , 3 '' chinatown-special drain mesh , pyrex measuring cup , and my zyliss salad spinner . i bought this particular model for my dad 's birthday and both he and my mom love it . i have a similar version at home ( clear , see-through ) and my girlfriend 's parents have an earthen-ware version at home . they all work great . once you try this , there 's no way you 're going to go back to the traditional butter dish
0	my husband bought this for me for christmas 2005 . i was thrilled to get it since i had an older , smaller model . i had never burned any food in a slow cooker before i used this model . i could n't figure out how to get it to cook slowly . i finally called customer service and was told i was n't using the right kinds of recipes . she told me that the pot had to be at least 75 % full . i used her advice , but it still boils everything on every temperature level . i use it to make roasts and that is all . it `` sweats '' horribly and i have to put it on a cutting board so it does n't burn my countertop . the handle cracked after 6 months . my biggest `` ah-ha '' moment was when i came home after a long day out . there had been a power surge , and it had reset itself . my whole meal was ruined and that is when i realized the value of a dial-knob slow cooker . just back away slowly from this one
1	this core is remarkable . it is so easy to use , just fill it with cake batter and insert it in the cake pan . pour the remaining batter in the pan and large cakes come out wonderful . this heating core allowed by daughters half sheet cake to come out perfect
0	it 's a beautiful mug ( we 've bought 2 ) but it drips , does n't keep the temperature , it 's a nightmare to clean and it 's not higienic - unbelievable bad product
0	the item ordered 7/19/2006 has not been received as of 8/19/2006
1	i heard that tab water in baltimore city isnt good for health , so i decided to by this water filter . this item makes tab water drinkable . it removes bad smell and taste of tab water . i also read that it filters many different things . because it is designed to be fit in the door side , i could organize well
0	this griddle performed very poorly and i will not be keeping it . it cooked very unevenly ( the left side of a 4-inch pancake was almost burned , while the right side was practically raw ) and the pancakes stuck , even though it is supposed to be preseasoned ( it 's cast iron ) and i heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil . it also did not sit securely on my gas stove , due to the 'grill ' ridges on the other side -- it rocks back and forth slightly -- even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass . because i use my griddle almost every weekend , i am considering the broil king ultra large electric giddle , which got cook 's illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests .
1	the one-touch pet gate 150 is excellent ! i matches my hardwood floor and is attractive . i especially like that the door swings both ways for easy accessibility
0	i 've owned one of these for about a month . it 's a total waste of money . it rarely sprays , just a steady stream of oil . i 'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads , etc . i am so very disappointed ... ... i 'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it 's advertised
0	we now have the 4.2 gallon humidifer , as well as the air softener , all vornado , and this one is most disappointing . the construction is a bit flimsy , but my biggest complaint is the area coverage . the unit is supposed to support at least a 600 sq ft space . we have it in our master bedroom which is smaller than this and the air still feels very dry in our bedroom even after we 've been running it for 2 days now non-stop on the high setting . granted , i have a pretty heightened sensitivity to the moisture in the air in our bedroom given i have a cold and nasal congestion , but i expected more from this unit given our satisfaction with the other . we run the air softener on our 1st floor , which covers several rooms and it definitely maintains a level of moisture there very well . the 4.2 unit is in our basement , which again covers several room and that one also has met our satisfaction . we bought this because we needed one just for our master bedroom and we are pretty disappointed . we have radiator heat and are suffering through the cold winter of chicago right now .
0	i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6-10 times over the course of 13 months , it stopped working . i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk
0	i bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they do n't work well . the manual is not thorough , but it does tell you after you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an ac adapter . i just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and was n't about to buy an ac adapter to see if that fixed it . it cut off my mom 's voice and i rarely heard her message . the units also have annoying beeps that ca n't be turned off . no real volume control either . a very overpriced and poorly designed unit . also , the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them . the sound is clear if it does n't cut you off , but the units are far from user-friendly .
1	these are my favorite cookers . so much so , i bought this one for my friend
1	this has got to be the greatest little heater . the only problem that i had was getting it to stop beeping when you change a setting . other than that , i really like the remote , and use this in my office at work .
1	this was a lot of fun . its big and different from my golden 's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound , not a squeak but a honk , if you will . the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker . this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog 's short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan .
1	i got this gift from my husband i love the machine it so easy to use . i read so many other and i was afraid i was not going to get the machine and go buy my normal coffee but i bought the coffe , syrups and much more just to make them like the coffee shop was easy . the only thing i do n't like is the height of th cup area or the noise . i had to go purchase other cups and them dump it into my bigger cups . they do offer you to buy a attachment for the bigger cups .
0	when this fountain is freshly cleaned , the cats love it . the water does stay cool . but cat hair -- lots of that around here -- clogs the pump , and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly , it grows slime . eeeeuuuw . the first pump lasted about three months , then the replacement lasted about a month . not really worth it , because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway .
0	i really like the look of this bread bin , but the manufacturer does not package it in a box . it only has a clear plastic bag around it . even though amazon uses it 's own box for shipping , it arrived with dents and cracks . amazon quickly replaced it with another one , which had dents , cracks , and the entire bottom was was badly scratched . i do n't have time to keep sending these back hoping to get a replacement which is n't damaged , so i gave up after returning the second one
0	the blender i received also smelled as if it was overheating and the tachometer did not work . i am sending it back and will be asking for a refund . this clearly is not a reliable blender
0	hi , really like drinking wine from these glasses . ended up with 8 each in two sizes . broke my 4th glass the other day while cleaning it . never broke any other end-high stemware doing that . believe me , i 've been very careful too . also had one break in a very modern dishwasher operating on a crystal cycle . just too thin and fragile despite the resonable price and good functionalit
0	i read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway . i was stupid . i had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months . that one is great and has held up after multiple washings . it is still so soft . so i just did n't belive the two bad reviews . i was wrong . the bad reviews are correct . i took these new 9 out of the box yesterday . they are not of the same quality of the one i already have . they are packed at least 3 different ways . i think maybe some of them are someone else 's defective returns . i do n't think these are first quality . there are many snags . there is at least one blue stain . one looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily . the quality of the construction is not good . some are soft , some are rough . i returned all 9 . do not buy
0	the bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status . this causes the fabric to be so thin , you can just about see your hand through it . also , out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled . the good news is that the red border color that i chose did not bleed in the washer . further , they did not shrink at all . i do n't know how they feel to sleep on , as they are for a guest bed , for occasional use only . just by the way they look , if i were to use them daily i would have returned them
1	do your banana 's turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them ? this used to be a huge problem in my house . but now that i have the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger this is no longer an issue . i hang my bananas up the moment i get home from the grocery store . they think they are still on the tree out in the wild ! silly bananas ... green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer . once , i got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger ! the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger is compact and does n't take up much counter space which is a definite plus . and it 's almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display
1	i have a beagle/basset hound mix , who as you can guess used to bark all the time . after only using product for a coupld of says there is a vast improvement . he does not even have to wear it all the time now . there is a lot more peace and quite at my house since i purchased this product . it saved my sanity
0	i was looking for a timer that had a loud ringer i could hear from another room while cleaning , so i could check on what i 'm cooking.. this one just did n't do that for me . i notice the sound it sends out is not always the same.. sometimes it is a bit louder then other times..to me that does not do me much good..i can not depent on it all the time ! so now i just use it to keep near me when i 'm at the computer , but i do notice more of the sound comes out of the back , but then you ca n't see how much time you have left , if you turn it backwards ! ! ! the ringer goes for 1 min . this does not count backward . the numbers and buttons are large , which is probably the reason i bought this timer . the two magnets are not very big , and does not stay on my frig very good . when its on my frig , and i start to press the buttons , it starts moving all over . price wise , this is probably a good buy , depending on what you want to use it for . i bought another timer that the ringer is louder , but the buttons and are very small.. guess you can not have it all , no matter at what the price is !
1	this is great , it is very easy to clean , just put it in the dishwasher . you never have to worry about getting honey or syrup all over again . it pours very clean and does n't drip after you 're done . it looks very nice too . great deal with a classy look
1	a good way to make a cup of coffee . particularly good if you want a fresh brewed taste , but do n't need to brew a full pot for only one or two people . can be stored in a cabinet or drawer , eliminating the use of counter space . a must have for small kitchens
0	i bought this product in december 2004 . after two months of use ( about once a week ) the on/off switch broke . eventually after using it for a year ( and trying to get hoover to correct the problem ) , just before christmas 2005 i got quite a fright when i started smelling smoke whilst using it . i discontinued the use of the product , and asked hoover once again to please look at it . their reply was that i should take it to one of their authorised shops , where they 'll repair it , charge me . then hoover will see if it was in fact a factory error and only then refund me when they feel they 're not in the wrong . please . do n't waste your money on this product . it is defnitely not worth it . it is noisy , vacuums carpets well when used to work , but is unable to vacuum floors at all . ( one of the options on it ) . sorry , hoover . but you have lost a loyal customer . ( my whole family for 3 generations back has always bought hoover , including myself ...
0	these are great towels if you can get them . they are very soft and a great price but i ordered them in december and they came in one at a time . took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock . when i ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship . buy these only if you have a life time to get the
1	this food processor is the most powerful and quietest that i have ever used . i am very impressed with the material the bowl and lid are made of . the ones i have been using for the last 15 years have not been comparable in the least
1	i have had this desk for about a year now and feel this desk is perfect for anyone who does not have a lot of space and wants to add style and function . the desk and hutch are easy to put together and sturdy . i have all the matching pieces . i recomend this product and trust products that come from target
1	the cheaper ones do n't quite fit ... unfortunate because these are so expensive ... which is why i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars ... i would give five for the product , but the price really is outrageous ... they know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers ( hamilton beach , not amazon ) ... too bad the makers of these machines do n't have the users in mind , instead of their bank accounts ... they take advantage of people who need these humidifiers
0	i really made a mistake and bought 2 sets , thinking i could always have extras ready . i tried all types of grinds , i packed loosely , i packed firmly , i packed tight , i played and played . still did not get a good cup of coffee . finally , threw them out . just taking up space . learned a lesson on buying quantity
0	this looks like a good idea from westinghouse , but if you read the warranty details , the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10-year warranty . $ 10.00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years - but not really ? what is the point ? extra tape is n't even included when the first strip fails . i suggest you use a flashlight
1	does anyone know of a good site where you can get a good deal on the bag liners for these great trash cans ?
1	we are using 2 love seat throws for an old l-shaped sectional sofa . it really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color . the material quality is great for the price . the only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping , say about once a day . the throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in-built mechanisms to hold in place ( e.g . a velcro system , straps , etc ) . so you have to put the throw over the sofa again neatly . if you do n't mind arranging the throw about once a day , this will be a very inexpensive and great looking cover for your sofa .
0	the unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface . 100ft . would be pushing it
0	there is a clear echo here , so to simply quote the experience of another reviewer , `` after two months the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead . '' rather than paying to ship the unit to krups myself -- -clearly , the company can not afford to pay shipping on the thousands of these cheaply made units -- -i hauled the krups fnp112-42 down to my workshop and found that the hose to the steamer had detached . well , fixing that problem did not render the fnp112-42 usable , for now it simply exhaled steam in great plumes like a bull in a bugs bunny cartoon . cleaning the unit per the directions from krups did nothing whatsoever . nor did shaking it robustly or inserting various instruments into the nonworking nozzles serve any purpose , but at least i felt a bit better . turns out the only thing getting steamed was me . . . i 'm going to buy a good espresso maker this year for christmas and i can promise you that it will not have the word krups emblazoned on it .
1	i purchased these sheets together with the pike street 800 thread count sheet set as they were being offered as a combo special , made on the page if you wanted to order the 800 thread count sheets , which i did , and i can not tell you how thrilled i am with both sets of sheets . if you can still get them both together ( amazing price ) you should , you will not be disappointed at all . they are both very well made wonderful to sleep on . i have an 18 '' thick mattress and they fit perfectly . my husband and i love good quality sheets and we both highly recommend these . the few wrinkles that you may find after they come out of the dryer should in no way affect your decision to buy these wonderful sheets and miss out on this sheer elegance . i mean after all , you deserve it , you are worth it , so go for it . for my husband and i , an incredible nights sleep in total comfort ... ..priceless
1	i bought this stone to detail the edge of the new set of calphalon forged kitchen knives that i recently purchased . i have used oriental water stones in the past , and this stone is as good as any i have used . with just a few strokes , it will turn a calphalon , henckles , or wusthof into a gillette . with this stone and a good steel , your knives will last far beyond your years
1	in our family we give a `` mystery '' kitchen item each year . everyone tries to guess what the item is used for . this spreader really had the group stumped , someone finally came up with it on the third day , with some minor hints . since then my 11 year old has been using it to make sandwiches . she says it works great , but you need to spread the peanut butter first . this really is a gift for some one who has everything
0	first off , this is available at the ewins site for $ 30 , should you decide to plunge . the construction of the wooden parts is pretty nice , better than what you 'd expect for $ 50 , but that 's about the only positive thing . the hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you `` need '' , so you 're kind of sol when the crappy aluminum cams break . i 'm sure they 'd send some more if i asked , but for now my piece is hanging out , half way assembled because i 'm scared of breaking any more of the hardware . either way , i think i 'm going to ditch the cam/bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up . the instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web . if you 've never built flat pack furniture before you will not be able to figure it out . even if you have , you will put something together incorrectly and have to disassemble the piece
0	we received it broken..i do n't have the oriinal box to send it and do n't know what to do so just bought another one in a local stor
0	my timer did n't work either . it arrived broken in two pieces , and even though i was able to put it back together , it just did n't work . back it went . it 's cute , but pretty much useless
0	this came broken the packaging was not good . damage good do n't make happy custome
1	i find that these filters are the most consistent in fit , easiest to seperate and do the best job of filtering
0	ordered this at my wife 's request . she 's tried cleaning silver earrings -- run multiple cycles -- added detergent as suggested . it just does n't clean . an old toothbrush and toothpaste works much better . a very disappointing piece of junk
1	we love these glasses , we have had the reidel glasses , like these , many times . . . they break so easily and ca n't go in the dishwasher . these glasses are so much more utilitarian , we use them as our everyday glasses , not just for wine . they look great , feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher , and cost so much less . we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions , they are more refined , but i got so tired of that ultra-thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass . i strongly recommend the libbey glasses . . . you will like it , like , like it on your table , table , table
1	this rascal works great ! i put a half frozen bagel in it and it cut through no problem ! i would highly recommend it over a holder and knife
0	i have been using these filters for years . my first impression with them is that they are very expensive . my second impression is that they might not work as well as i thought they did . i recently bought a water distiller and i have been experimenting with different sources of water in it . i have used hot water directly from the tap , cold water directly from the tap , and brita filtered water in the distiller . the brita filtered water left the most residue in the distiller , which is very disconcerting . the filters let out small amounts of carbon all the time into the top of their proprietry resevoir . in the directions , it says to slowly add water to the filtering well , which is what i do , but it still leaches at least thirty little pieces of carbon in the prefiltered water . i want clean water , not water with small pieces of carbon floating in the filling well . i have always wanted to believe the filters were working , but now am very skeptical .
0	bought this knife set 3 months ago . it was beautiful with unique patterns on the blade and very sharp . but within few days we noticed it rusts very quickly . we left a knife in the sink in the morning after breakfast , by the time we came home for dinner the knife had several rust spots . we had to use barkeeper 's friend to clean all the rust out . we 've tried to clean and dry the knives immediatly after every use - real pain in the # * @ - but once in a while one will be forgotten for couple hours and then rust immediatly forms . once , when someone else was helping clean up , one went into the dishwasher . it did n't only have rust all over but the blade edge rusted away ! now the knife has jagged edge ! ! ! i guess if i grind down the knife about 1mm i 'll have a full edge again but i did n't expect this from top-of-the-line knives . will not buy this brand of knives anymore
0	i had one of the originals ... with the vaneer look . -- ugly yes , but it was actually very sturdy well made . unfortunately , it got lost in a move . then i purchased the newer one . it just was n't as good of quality the latch section cracked on me on the fourth or fifth use ! garbage ! pay more $ on a cuisenart or delongi ... you 'll be happier .
1	this soup pot is an excellent addition to any cook 's set of tools . using this pot , there 's no need to saute meats of veggies in one place and then transfer them to an ovenproof pot to finish . it goes easily from stovetop or oven to the table and is compatible with almost any dinnerware . can you tell i really like my new soup pot
0	i purchased this fryer after the death of our previous deep fryer thinking you get what you pay for . so i splurged . yes , i read the reviews which had a lot to do with my decision to purchase this particular fryer - mistake ... . no one explains that the plug is extremely short or the fact that the magnet holding this heavy cord has a difficult time keep it plugged into the fryer . the temperature does n't seem to stay consistent as my previous fryer - yes , i know that adding food to the oil will reduce the temp . after only 6 months with average use of once per month - it 's dead . bewar
1	love the soup bowls . they live up to the usual fiestaware quality as all of the other products from fiestaware . so pick your color and enjoy
0	looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet . item is being returned
1	i love this - it keeps the bed toasty . i takes some time to warm up the bed . i turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour . when i get it , it 's very nice and i turn it down to 1 or 2 . i find if i keep it on 5 all night i roast . i do prefer this product to an electric blanket . it has n't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills , and it was worth the purchase price . if you have a big pillowtop mattress , the pad does n't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet . otherwise , i would have given the product 5 stars
1	this is a big saucepan ! i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines . this has become my favorite pot for many things ; from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night . the see-through lid is great for monitoring food as it 's cooking , and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring . it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look , and i love it
1	i check out all the local stores for a glass-lined carafe , but could find none . this is a great product . keeps coffee hot ( especially when primed with hot water first )
1	as most people do , i had accumulated several different types of cookware over the years . it was a real treat to pass these onto my kids and just use this great cuisinart chef 's classic set . i especially love the saute pan
1	what a beautiful bowl -- i love the tea rose design by pfaltzgraff ! i liked it so much that i ordered a second one ! this seller sends items very quickly , and they package their items with extreme care . i love this seller
0	after buying an aluminum i read about the leaching of the mayerial into the food and the health risks involved . i was advised to spend the extra money . since this is a stock item , i took it to wal-mart and traded it for a 6 quart stainless . boy was i surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as i used to have a sixx litter european and a whole chicken fits just fine . anyway , i ca n't recommend this , because of the material and because of the size . if i could afford it , i would go for the electric pressure cooker with at least an 8 quart size of stainless - cuisinart or other brands check amazon around $ 150 and up . you get what you pay for
1	i 've lusted after a super auto for years . when i finally decided to get one , i did a fare amount of investigating . the gaggia titanium had the best spec 's for the price and good reviews . i decided to spend the extra money for the stainless unit . i have n't seen the painted plastic model so i ca n't comment on the appearance . i do think the stainless looks great ! you can find reviews of the non-stainless here on amazon and other than the outside appearance , the device is the same . i 've only had the unit for a few days but so far , i 'm very happy . to the negatives first . the manual is awful ! it 's not just the italian to english translation ! the text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great . i spent a fair amount of time making sure i understood how to setup and use the unit . i 'm pretty technically savvy and in the end , i figured it all out . but do n't rush into using this product until you 've figured out how to set it up , clean it and adjust all the settings ( there are many ) . the only issue i 've had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it 's empty when it 's not . open the lid ( which could be a bit better designed ) and stir and it works . could be the beans i 'm using not sure . it 's an intermittent issue . the good stuff : once you figure out the coffee strength and grind , the gaggia makes a delicious cup . i wish the brew were a tad hotter ( i have it set to max ) but using the cup warmer helps . no issues making froth with the wand ; much better than the older manual machine i had . you ca n't put a huge mug under the unit ( the max size is 4.5 inches ) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed . you can set the unit for the amount of brew . however , i found that clicking the `` large coffee '' button twice , the unit thinks it 's making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug . it 's much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size . you get a nice foam on top and as i said , the coffee is outstanding . i love the clean up ( or lack of ) compared to the drip maker i had ( a bodum vacuum unit ) . i still have that unit should i need to make a lot of coffee for company . but for the two mugs i drink in the morning , the gaggia easily replaces this unit . and there 's far less cleanup . the grinds sit in a canister and after a few days , you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse . so , you can use this gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you 're making a cup or two . what i love is just pressing a button twice ( for two large coffees ) and walking away from the unit . a minute later , a great cup of joe . it truly is super automatic . i have the unit set for energy savor whereby it 's in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after i use it . i only drink in the morning . however , if you decide to `` wake it up '' , it heats up in about 2 minutes . it also does a rinse cycle so i keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water . there is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days . there 's also a `` full rinse '' cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir . it 's a menu item so do n't select it unless you really want to do this ( takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire ) . yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks , i 'm very happy . update . the issue with the grinder was the beans ( too oily ) . i called the ny office and got someone in `` tech support '' in minutes . she knew her product . sure enough , the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area .
0	i bought these candles in the store . when i got home , i set everything up and lit the candles . in less that 30 minutes , all 5 candles had burned to half way , and the strings the medals are on had caught on fire too . the entire thing was on fire ( a big fire ) . i was able to blow it out , and take it outside to the trash can . i have bought target candles before , and love them . i am not happy ! !
1	it 's a three-piece roasting rack -- two sides and a long `` pin '' that holds them together . when assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles . it 's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey , and after using it with a 22 lb turkey i believe that claim . the tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan , and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do . in fact , my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our maxam steel roaster , which is currently my favorite roasting pan . the truly cool thing about this rack , however , is n't the handles or the shape . it 's that nifty pin at the bottom . you see , you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin , then you simply remove the sides . that 's it . they pull right away from the turkey , leaving it behind on its platter . no more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack ; it 's right where you want it already . for all of its non-stick properties the rack did take some real elbow-grease to clean -- particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars -- but that is n't very surprising . it does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product , however . also , there is one problem that did bother us ; it seems that some of the non-stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking . we thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 f was too high a temperature for the rack , but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that i could find . i 'm still giving this item a rating of four because it 's just so incredibly cool an idea , and so remarkably useful , but i have to admit that i 'm not thrilled with the idea of a non-stick coating that flakes , and i wish the item was dishwasher-safe . i 'd love to see cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material
1	i like the style , weight and size of this set , but i 'm not sure how it is going to hold up in the dishwasher . i 've had it about a month and am starting to see some rust like spots on some of the pieces like have been mentioned in other reviews . we 'll see if they get worse .
0	i have used wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness . but i sincerely regret having bought these sheets . i purchased one set , and , after the 2nd wash , there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on ( all the little `` balls '' felt scratchy ) . my husband asked me why we were using the `` old '' sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn ! i was so suprised that i called wamsutta directly , and the very nice lady there assured me that i must have gotten a defective set , because that simply `` does n't happen with their sheets '' . so i exchanged them with an identical pair . and the end of the story is that i am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing . what a disappointment . absolutely do not recommend , and am now very wary of all wamsutta products
0	as great as it looks , i ca n't get past the incomplete directions ( only printed outside of the box ; no directions inside ) to get it installed on the wall : it says `` pull out the plastic end cap '' ... have n't a clue what the plastic end cap is , nor how to pull it out nor how to install the screws that hold it on the box . may have to return
1	let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25-year-old woman who is n't really big on doing chores . i got a dyson for christmas , and just tried out the dusting brush last week . my immediate reaction was : `` this is genius ! '' it is great for dusting computers , televisions , lampshades , bookcases ( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices , so normal dusting never seemed to help ) , the tops of books , cd organizers , ceiling fan blades , metal bedframes ... i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment , and it works beautifully . this attachment will not disappoint , trust me . it 's already made my life so much easier and cleaner
0	i 'm glad some of you received these dishes not broken in a million pieces ! amazon or whoever is packaging these needs to learn how to properly pack . there was no bubble wrap or popcorn at all - just flimsy sheets of cardboard ! ! duh ? ? i 've sent them back twice now and third time wo n't be a `` charm '' for me , 'cause i wo n't go through this again . never will i ever order breakables from amazon again . the headache was not worth it - even if the dishes are nice and pretty .
1	very loud and heavy . i have used lighter and less noisy vacuums in the past . this one does pick up hair and lint very well . seems to deep-clean . for the price , it was a good deal
1	i had all but given up hope on electric can openers until i bought this one . you can tell when you pick it up that it 's of good quality ( not cheap , plastic junk ) . the removeable head is also very solid/heavy duty , and washes easily in the dishwasher . the black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter , as well . i 'm a believer again in electric can openers
0	when i ordered this product , it had a 4 star average rating - how that happened is beyond me . were a zero star rating available , this product would n't even deserve the string of uncolored stars ! i purchased it , thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic `` freebie '' grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago . after many refills , that all-plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the `` gears '' , the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper . so i order this one -- it 's attractive , low/mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out -- and guess what ? i 'm still using the plastic worn-out grinder ! this miu grinder was a total waste of money and i just ca n't bear to listen to it squeal when i attempt to use it . its adjustement is loose enough , that 's not the problem . what good 's a lifetime warranty against wearing out if i 'm not going to use the grinder at all ? now i 'm stuck with it , unless i want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order , so basically , i may could get a few bucks back . which is probably what i 'll do because this grinder is n't worth 2 cents ! i would n't even give the thing away . maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person . i 'll certainly not purchase another one online . if you like the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard , buy this grinder . buy a second one for your salt while you 're at it . you 'll love 'em ! ( update 1 month later - i tried to give this thing a chance and the god-awful squealing is becoming less consistent . which might be even worse , as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high-pitched jag every so often . it 's gotten quite worse , however , with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn ... from fine grind to quarter-corn sized pieces in a few turns . not recommended at all . i might try switching it over to salt , maybe it can handle that better .
0	one of the plate i bought broken during a 50 seconds medium heat microwaving , so i doubt it is really good for microwave . when i called lenox , their rep. simply asked if i want to order a replacement from them as if the bad quality was not their problem . disguesting . the design pattern was nice though
0	the design is such that when you pour out liquid , some of it seeps into the space between the outer plastic and the vacuum glass container . then , when one sets the carafe on a counter , the liquid leaks out . this could be a problem with a particular unit or a marginal design
0	would n't you think that the manufacturers of a wine rack would measure the bottles of wine before designing the rack ? apparently not , in this case . after purchasing 3 of these racks , i discovered that about 10 % of my 200 bottle collection does n't fit in the grid holes . it was understood that magnums were n't going to fit , which was no big deal . but when over 20 bottles end up sitting on the floor because they are about 1/8 '' to 1/4 '' too large in diameter i get a little irritated , especially after paying over $ 300 including shipping . the overall quality of the product is average . the racks were not straight along their length and had to be tie-wired together to keep them in alignment .
1	i purchased the smallest version , the lw 14 , for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows . air ionizers did n't rid the air of the frying smells , but this appliance works . the initial price is high , but not the cost to keep the venta running . water is cheap . power consumption on highest setting is about 35 watt . for whisper-quiet use in a bedroom a lower setting is better . any air-con would be much louder anyways and drown out the venta on the highest setting . the motor used to power the machine is indeed very silent , and possible ca n't be manufactured for 30 $ . the other components are ruggedly constructed and hopefully last many years . the device can also be used for aromatherapy , which i 'm just testing with some natural mint oil against my cold
1	i absolutely love this tablecloth ! it is a nice gentle white color that goes very well with my dark wood dining set . it is very easy to clean because it repels liquids . i love this tablecloth so much that i want to get it in a few more colors to change it up for different seasons .
1	i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum . wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction . it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum . so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities . its so light ... about nine pounds and easy to transport and store . its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button . the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum . they are very easy to get at and change . its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors , along baseboards and on stairways . not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch . i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming . this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright . my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool . many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too . i am glad i bought it and would recommend it . its the vacuum i would use most . the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done . push a button and the cord automatically rewinds . whats not to like about this vacuum . highly recommended
0	do n't make the mistake of thinking your dog could play with this . it 's to large . would be great if they made it smaller for dog
1	this is a good pet bed and a bargain for the prize . seems to be well made , very puffy , my dog was trying to pound it down before laying on it . i love the round shape , have always had rectangles but this fits the area better and seems to provide plenty of laying room for the dog
0	i 'm sending it back immediately . no where in the description of the product did it say it was plastic , and i do n't feel i should be charged for return postage
1	there is n't much you can say about a sharpening steel . it sharpens well , and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest . the handle is ugly gray plastic , but it seems solidly put together , and is easy to work with
1	it 's pretty comfortable , but what new mattress is n't ? the foam-memory material takes a little getting used to . i generally prefer a very firm mattress , and had to get used to the `` sinking-in '' feeling . i 've also found you ca n't really use a lot of pillows . what i like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns , or gets out of bed , you do n't feel it . the smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell , but it is n't as obnoxious as it 's made out to be , but definitely present . if ignored , it will linger for about a month or so . i did n't try to spray anything on it because it did n't really bother me that much . over all it 's a good mattress , although not the greatest thing since sliced bread . i 'm sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress , and feel i 've definitely gotten my moneys worth . i would recommend it .
0	i bought it . did n't work . exchanged it . the new one did n't work . same problem -- the pump is very weak and just barely seaps out a few drops of liquid soap ... that 's all . and yes , it does very easily rust . spend the extra $ 5 and get something better
0	it is soft and feels sooooo good ! ! ! but the burgundy sheeds like a cat it is all over the floor , my hair , the red fur is every were ! ! ! i only get one pillow cast and one sheet like thing ! ! ! i have 2 ( two ) pillows please ! in the photo it looks like two of every thing ! ! help me here ! ! where is the other one ?
0	i have two great danes who love chew-treat toys . especially kong . i brought the everlasting treat balls home and they both were able to pop out the treat within 2 minutes ! they enjoyed the treats- but the expensive plastic ball is useless . i will be returning this product tomorrow
1	being a wine lover , i 've used all kinds of corkscrews , from your basic twist model to the kind with the `` wings '' to the two-pronged kind . finally , i received the screwpull as a gift , and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end ! as others have said , the screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up , so there 's no actual `` pulling '' whatsoever -- all you do is simiply turn the easy-to-use lever at the top of the device . in almost 10 years of usage , the screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork ; on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try ( probably because i started too close to the edge ) , simply starting over solved the problem . spend a little more money to buy the screwpull , and you 'll never need to buy another corkscrew again ; highly recommended
0	moved into a new home . wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets , decided to try a bagless model . this thing is a total waste of money . it has barely any suction whatsoever , especially when trying to use the hose , so for now after running this thing i have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets , to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just could n't suck up . it 's ridiculous , it 's a brand new vacuum ! i have never had to do this with any other vacuum . i had my husband make sure it was working right and it is , it just has a very weak suction . this thing is going back to the store and i am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum . don '' t waste your money ! also , i have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping , and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors ( well , they all pretty much do that job , but for some reason this has a bare floor setting , whoop de do ! ) it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor , nor can it suck up a cobweb ! do n't buy
0	i had my first machine for 5 months - a gift from a friend . when it started to let steam out all over the place , i went out and bought another one . i thought i was just unlucky with the first one . it also only lasted 5 months like the first one . i cleaned it - vinegar etc ... like the instructions said - no luck . steam came from everywhere . it would not warm the milk anymore . i took it back . never again .
1	not the best wine opener you can buy , but a great deal for the occassional wine drinker . much easier to operate than the traditional corkscrew and a bargain at the $ 9.99 i paid
1	the price went down from $ 6.95 to $ 3.95.it 's very nice looking , you will be pleased with it.approximately 13 and a half inch square.i was expecting a black cloth loop to hang it from , but the loop turned out to be the sewn in label.that 's okay
1	a beautiful pan from kitchenaid . i use it for everything and the lid is a big bonus . think of it as a 10 '' skillet you use everyday , which can also go into the oven , and also be used for serving . quality and heft is better than all clad
1	just what i was looking for , it is an odd sized cover that is hard to find . great quality also
0	not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs , but the company also refused to provide a refund/replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing . after sitting out in a rainstorm , the super bark stop shorted out and is now totally worthless . find another product - you 'll thank me later
0	total rubbish . wood was scratched on top , corner was smashed , water damage on the shelf , and door was cracked . it is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use . the holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together . extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control . to add salt in the wound , the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and i had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it . if you like taking chances and do still want to buy it , it 's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged .
0	do not buy this expecting the lid in the description ! i never recieved the lid described in the description section . they had a similar skillet in colors for less . skillet is a quality weight anodized aluminum . it has what seems to be a high quality nonstick interior . the comfort handle has a good feel and is oven safe to 450 degrees . con the cushion handle means you can not use in a broiler . no top browning your omelet in the broiler
0	sent it back . could n't see the read-out with a plate or saucer on the scale . needs a tilted or canted face
1	sheets are great just the lace on top can be bothersome when sleepin
1	why would you get a smaller toaster oven when you can get this one at such a good price ? it works well , looks good and you can actually fit things in it . never be frustrated by what you ca n't fit in your toaster oven !
0	i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again . this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money . i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it . it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy . i would say this table is worth $ 20 and no more ... ... ... ..
1	immediately became my favorite skillet . cooks evenly , cleans up easily . only wish it also came in the 12 '' size
0	well built , take apart to clean , very noisy and the setting for the width of slicing moves to much and thickness changes
1	these are great ! the keep my drinks cold for a very long time and are top-rack dishwasher safe ! !
0	i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen . this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it ! it ticks but the bell does n't ring at the end . also , i was disappointed in it 's packaging as well as the item itself . it does not look upscale . the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic . if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item , look elsewhere !
0	great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken . amazon , how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer does n't pack them well enough for shipping ? amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go . any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic . i 've received two of those lovely surprises , the first set i ordered and the replacement set . oh boy , i give up ! the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them . just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard . they break ! amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement ( in this case ) so it 's like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage . are you feeling lucky ? ? ? if so then roll the dice
0	with an old coffee can . true it does n't have the `` odor free '' aspect , but if you are scooping a litter box there is going to be odor . i just keep the can by the box and dump it in the trash when full . same deal .
0	this grater is fine when you can get it to work , but most often the handle does n't screw in correctly and you ca n't get it to . it 's mostly a waste of time , though the concept is a great one . i 'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one
1	so far this product is working fine , has plenty of power . heats food in a flash . very good quality for the price i paid for i
1	birthday gift and my mom , great southern cook , was thrilled with them . that made me thrilled . john dwain
0	this fountain is a piece of junk . i ordered three of them , and all three had cracks and holes in the top piece . the top piece is a molded resin that is very thin in places . the thin regions easily crack , making it unsightly , interfering with the performance , and within days rendering the fountain unusable . i was very disappointed and ended up buying an entirely different fountain
0	yes . i opened immediately when ups delivered the window fan and it got a severe crack casing ! ! got to return to target minus off my shipping charges ! sad
1	after going through several nathan 's cheap stovetop grilles . i realized , that although i love grilling food , i needed a good grill pan . i did not wish upon a star but a dream came true with this marvelous cooking aid . i use it evry day , it nrver sticks and the heat is so evenly distrubuted that everything comes out perfect ! it also is a handsome addition to my kitchen .
1	good cooker , very functional , works well , been using it for a year and never had a problem
0	i have owned this type of product for years and it works very well . this review is to warn others to think twice about ordering it from amazon . they shipped the first one damaged . then the replacement for the damaged one was much worse than the first one ! very frustrating and time wasting . think about it ... its a plastic product that if not shipped/packed properly is going to be damaged and will likely leak water . i have ordered many things from amazon for many years and this is the worst result i have seen . needless to say i am getting a refund and buying from another retailer
1	just purchased my airwasher/ humidifier and so far am pleased with the ease of maintenance . i felt compelled to write a review and let other consumers know that the required water treatment additive is available from the manufacturer website with no shipping and handling charges , www.venta-airwasher.co
1	i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife . oh wow , this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it 's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies . it also fits in your hand extremely well . if you are going to cut up a potato , it is hard to beat the chef 's knife . however , for cutting up a tomato , carrot , etc . this thing is the best tool i have ever used . just wonderful
1	i spray my foods with olive oil using this wonderful sprayer . it 's great to use if you want to avoid the unhealthy chemicals you get in the spray cans off the shelf . just poor in your favourite olive oil
1	i only gave this product 4 stars because my daughter has n't slept in it yet . but i set it up and it was super easy , almost one touch , set up . it is firm yet comfortable and the super soft fleece cover is awesome . it has moons and stars on it . the take down was 5 minutes if that . it 's small enough to fit almost anywhere , and deep enough so that a toddler ( my daughter is 2 ) will not roll off ) . love it and i know i will be using it often .
0	why do they call it a 3 cup press..i barely get one cup out of it ! ! are they talking expresso cups ? well anyway , every single time i use it i get grounds in my cup ! everytime ! grounds ! ! ! ! yuck ! this is the third french press i have owned and it is the worst of the three ! i guess i will continue my search for a fourth french press before i choke on too many grounds ! ! ! !
1	i collect both old and new fiesta ware and was thrilled to see the vibrant new sunflower yellow dinnerware . the color is wonderful ; much darker and more golden than the old yellow . this bowl , particularly , is nice . because it is not too deep , your dinner guests can see your favorite dish ; because it holds two quarts , there 's plenty to serve . very lovely product that is easy to take care of
0	drip , drip , drip . one drip at a time . it takes 20 minutes to fill a pasta pot . we 've had it 3 years ( it never worked any faster than this ) and sometimes i 'm just tempted to just use the tap water and not worry about lead poisoning from the pipes
0	first of all , it 's expensive ( $ 60 ) . kitchen kaboodle sells the same exact one for $ 29.99 . i tried to return it to the company and found out they 're located in canada so it was going to cost me another $ 25.00 for shipping . due to shipping , i was forced to keep it . huge rip off ! ! it is good quality but go to kitchen kaboodle for half the cost !
1	we have tried a variety of knife sharpeners and they did n't work very well . finally , i purchased this item and we have been quite pleased ever since . friends even ask to use it . if you need sharp knives for cooking then this item is a great purchase . the cost may seem higher than most but well worth the quality and it really sharpens both serrated and straight knives . easy to use and nice addition to a kitchen where you enjoy cooking .
0	i , too , received this item with chipped corners , scratches , and broken pieces . unfortunately , the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it , so we 'll have to live with the damage . it 's a nice-looking desk otherwise , but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time
0	i was very disappointed to find the iron broken . so i have no idea if it worked well . now i have the expense of sending it back , plus i wo n't be able to use it for my holiday parties .
1	clean , elegant , easy to use and clean , but this cutting board has an aesthetic appeal that goes beyond mere functionality . clean lines , thinner than most boards , and the look and feel of wood without the practical ( and bacterial ) problems . a joy to use
0	i bought this griddle under the impression that it was non-stick - it is everything but that . i only cook with butter ( no sprays ) , but that does not matter . even with butter the eggs stick every time . even pancakes stick . this is the worst grill i have ever used
1	we have had this unit for 6 months and we really enjoyed it . it makes a great cup of coffee , it is easy to use and we do not understand why some other reviews complain . then - without any warning it stopped working . i called hamilton beach and they are sending a free replacement , no questions asked . the unit has a `` hassle free '' 3 year warranty and it really was a snap . we are glad we bought this unit and are happy with how hamilton beach stands behind their products
1	this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking . this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course . i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake . the 5 quart + was worth the money , do n't buy the 4 qt , save the money and purchase the 5 , you 'll be glad that you did
1	this mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot . i would expect to pay much more for such a product . the grind is even and consistent . the appearance is sleek and modern , yet classic . i would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift .
0	i liked the blinker light when i got it . in fact , friends noticed it and i referred them here to get it . however , in short order , it went on the blink , so to speak . the on-off mechanics are not well designed and literally half the time the darn thing is such a pain to get working , i either take it apart and reassemble it or throw it back in the drawer
0	zero best describes how well amazon supports what they sell ... great deal on this toaster absolutely . and it does a nice job on toast but after using the left side twice it stopped locking down so now we have a 2 slice toaster . amazon just takes your money and runs , giving the standard answer that you have to take it up with krups . krups to their credit at least will look at the problem and repair or replace it if they determine it is a warranty covered problem ... ..unfortunately you 'll have to box the item up and ship it to one of about `` krups service centers '' around the country to see if they fix it or not , at your cost - shipping cost more than the toaster did ... ..save yourself the aggravation ; go buy your toaster at walmart , bed bath beyond or someplace that will at least swap it out for you without all this hassle
1	plastic bowl seems like cheap plastic . the motor is great as it puree and chops
1	i received great customer service and a beautiful plant here . i would recommend this gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift . my gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition , is still very healthy , and smells terrific . i 've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said `` what smells so good grandma ?
1	this was a gift to my wife for valentine 's day . a good friend of hers had one and after she tried it , that 's all she wrote ! we have been extremely pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing one .
1	it 's as absorbent as advertised and the color is much better than the photos
1	we had a press made by singer that finally gave up the ghost after more than 10 years . after a several days of ironing clothes with mixed results a lot of frustration , we researched presses on amazon based on customer reviews . we decided on this press and have not been disappointed . the press is ready to use as soon as it 's out of the box . operation is simple all but self-explanatory , and it heats up very quickly . it is a little smaller than our previous press , but not so small as to be a drawback . clothes are ready in no time compared to ironing . the press comes with a water spray-bottle if you prefer not to use the steam feature . definitely worth the money spent
0	package arrived quickly . oven looks really nice . oven burns toast even on lowest settings !
0	the electric skillet takes forever to heat up and it does not heat in the corners also it takes longer to cook than an electric frying pan i would not recommend this product . thank yo
1	i odered this item as housewarming gift , the box has open display of 5 piece hostess set and 5 piece place settings , you can see and touch without open the box ! they are beautiful chess design . some people does n't care flatware using the right way and after write negative review . following this recomendations will result in the enjoyment of your j.a henckels flatware for many years ; 1 . do not allow acidic foods to remain in contact after use such as mustard , ketchup . lemon . etc rinse all flatware that have been in contact with the above foods before placing in the dishwasher . 2 , do not use detergents containing chlorides or a high lemon content . 3. do not soak for extended periods of time with tap water in the sink get rusting or spots . 4. in the dishwasher use a drying cycle . 100 % recommended !
0	i bought this coffee maker with great faith in the krups name -- willing to order online without the `` touch factor '' -- i was sorely disappointed . while the concept seems promising , the actual product is a failure . the carafe is awkward and you have to fiddle with it every time to pour your coffee . and , the handle simply came off after just 6 months of normal use ( a.m. coffee only ) . and there is no way to fix it as the bolts are lodged inside and ca n't be accessed . an expensive mistake and to think i 'd looked to krups to solve my problem of having to replace coffee makers every six months or so . do n't waste your money and i personally will avoid the krups brand from now on .
1	i recently ordered this sandwich maker , as i 'd been missing the one i had in the uk . i am really pleased with it , it makes excellent toasted sandwiches in a short period of time . they make great snacks and i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for this type of appliance
0	i am so disappointed with this vacuum ! i will say , it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet , but do n't expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye ! also , i have a cat - so i have pet fur on my carpet ... and i lose a lot of hair myself , and this vacuum does n't pick any of that up ... i can vacuum , run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair . it would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet ... it seems to do that very well , though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum , shake the filter out , etc , because it gets clogged very fast
1	i bought one like this several years ago . my pantry has a deep cabinet and only two shelves , so buying several more has really improved the way my canned goods and other items are stored in it now . can easily see what i 've got
1	as a le creuset cast iron fan , it was only natural that one day i would try out their stoneware products . while maintaining the same color options and increasing their product offerings , i still prefer the cast iron products over the stoneware . even so , there are times when the stoneware fits a need the cast iron can not effectively fulfill . the stoneware is not intended for use on the stovetop . besides this , the stoneware can go from the oven/microwave , to the table , and then to the refrigerator . virtually non-porous , le creuset 's stoneware is fired at 2156 degrees making it resistant to chipping , cracking , and staining . the enameling results in an easy to clean and scratch resistant surface , and will not absorb odors or flavors , and resists moisture absorption . this line is sure to perform for many years . the stoneware line has many of the same qualities the cast iron line is known for . this pie dish can be used for ice-cream pies , crisps , cobblers , pies , shepard 's pie , tamale pie , or any other number of dishes . pros : fits a need le creuset 's cast iron line sometimes can not same high quality standards found in le creuset 's cast iron line , but lighter weight made to last for many years cons : not intended for use on the stoveto
1	i , too , have an electric stove - i 'm glad others mentioned that ! cooks nicely , cleans up easily . absolutely love it - great price , too
1	this is one amazing tool . we went from vacuuming 3 times a week to once a week . we simply ca n't believe the difference . the dog seems to love it , too . i do n't have to work on him as long or hard or often as i did with the standard rake . i am a fan furever
1	this toaster oven is perfect . i have had this oven for about 6 months and had enjoyed cooking meals in the summer months without heating up the entire house . i have even cooked a whole chicken in it . this oven cooks food evenly and i have had no problems with it at all . i highly recommend this product . update . i still have this toaster oven and use it almost everyday . i still absolutely love it and do n't understand why everyone else seems to have issues with it . i do n't know what i would do with out this oven . i have owned it for over 3 years and it still works perfect . i recently cooked a prime rib in it and it turned out fabulous
0	it seemed to work when i first got it , but i 'm not really sure anymore . when i first got it , i changed the litter and put the smellkiller right near it . usually after i change the litter , i can still smell the litter , it just smells clean ; this time , i could n't smell anything . i keep the sponge moist and it still sits in the small area where the litter box is ; for the most part , i do n't notice any smells , but i 'm not sure if that is due to the smellkiller or because i use a baking soda kitty litter , a 2nd litter with crystals , and the a litter box deodorizer powder . i suppose it works ok , but i would n't buy another one , and i do n't think it works the miracles claimed in other reviews . also , mine did n't stay on the wall either ... came crashing down only 1 day after i put it up . now it just sits on top of the litter box
0	i bought this toaster and a b coffeemaker ( that 's no longer available because it sucked ! ) on the same day back in december 2005 . they both died a week apart , the toaster giving up the ghost just this morning when the slide would no longer stay down . maybe b makes nice power tools , but they 're batting a big zero with me in the kitchen small appliance department .
1	i see all the reviews agree - it is loud - but i love it . i was able to sleep with it on hi speed - but can see how it would disturb some people . it is very powerful - great for the bedroom - i often wake up hot or cold in the middle of the night - the four speeds remote control are very convenient .
1	i have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats . and the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly
1	this pitcher is the perfect size for entertaining . it makes a lovely appearance and is light weight . i had one in crystal and this is much better . additionally it 's a breeze to clean . 5 stars all around . appearance , weight , capacity , ease of cleaning , and price !
1	i am really enjoying my sunbeam mixer . it mixes good altho i 'm not to crazy about the button to raise the mixer it is a little hard to push . i would buy another one if i had to .
1	this soup tureen and bowls are the greatest . i use them a lot , and just throw them in the dishwasher . great value
1	some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 is defective out of the box . so far , i 've made 40 shots of espresso and 10 steamed ciders , and i 've been very pleased with the product . i 've been working on improving my technique and now i think the espresso is excellent . i prefer my homemade shots to the stuff i buy at starbucks and most other cafes , though this could be due to delusional pride in my own amateur baristaship . also , i may be over-excited because i 'd wanted an espresso machine for so long . the negatives ( so far ) are that it looks like there are is a fair amount of ongoing maintenance cleaning of the machine , though i doubt that this is unique to this brand . also , as others have mentioned , the espresso spout is low , so i drink my coffee out of ceramic ramikins ( although are n't low spouts authentic ? ) . also , i have n't gotten the steamer working quite right and i always end up with cappuccinos ( all foam ) even if i 'm trying to make a latte . hopefully i 'll get better with time . as for reliability , i 've only made 40 shots , so i ca n't speak to the long-term quality , but so far , so good . and heck , 40 espresso drinks at starbucks would 've cost me over $ 120 by now , although making it at home still is n't free -- if you use the convenient pods , it 's still about 50 cents a shot , and illy beans are expensive ( right now , i 'm using an unground dark-roasted kona , which is deep and very smooth )
1	helps with multi-cat households . i had one of my cats die and the following month i adopted a rescue . naturally , all five of my cats had issues . the feliway diffuser helped reduce their anxiety and fear . it is n't a cure-all , but it was/is a help .
0	this `` nifty '' piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so , i got it . i really wanted to get the air-o-swiss one but alas , it can not be found or shipped to canada ... weirdly . so far , i am less than impressed . took me forever to even get it working . the constant resetting is tiring . i did find a solution ( initial anyway ) - you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir ( where the round filter is ) and then it works . the noise it makes is not easy to get used to , no matter how tired you are . i am trying it for one night , then if i ca n't sleep i will return it . it 's not worth the money . my advice ? save up and get the air-o-swiss
0	beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop . although microfiber mops are relatively new , major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs . in order to standout from all the competition , five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops . google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews . fortunately the `` reviews '' were fabricated about a month ago so , hopefully , not too many customers have been deceived . my experience has been that most reviewers give , helpful honest reviews .
0	the outside ring works well but the inside ring leaves an incomplete cut . it appears that the two rings are not at the same level leaving no way that the inside ring can make contact with the cutting surface . i am cutting the inside ring with a separate modified piece of metal
1	i 've gone through several fogless mirrors in the last 20 years and this one is simply the best . i owned one before made by z fogless and could not find a replacement when it was broken . i had tried many other brands and found them to cloud up soon after i got them . the z fogless is the best shower mirror and the price beat all the competition including ebay
0	the set is lovely and coordinates perfectly with my ocr china set . the box is also beautiful . i wish they 'd give you a diagram for placement of the flatware in the box for those of us who are first-timers .
1	i bought a pack of 3 for my purifier . this filter does a good job and keeps the watrer tasting good
0	i received the clock in good condition , but , even though i tried several batteries , it never worked . i did not return it because the shipping would have cost more than the clock ! it ended up in the trash . i guess you really do get what you pay for
0	i am not fond of this particular microwave because of the loud clunky sound of the door opening . poor in my opinion . i ca n't believe that i will probably put up with this for years as i use my microwave several times a day . my husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons . seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input . like power buttons in the upper left corner . most-used buttons should be large . maybe in a special color . i like the web 2.0 look that is developing on user interfaces . no user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought . i asked my husband what was the brand name and he said `` sharp '' so even if cheap i think sharp ought to protect the brand image . but i see that i am in the minority of opinions here . maybe my advice is not order on line till you try this item out
1	they really do work as advertised . they go right into drywall ( be careful not to hit a stud however ! ) with no muss and no fuss . i have n't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds , but for basic home picture hanging , etc . they really do work as advertised
0	saucepan made in indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely . there was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit . it was in the construction of the pan . as a long time user of revere ware , we were very disappointed in this product sent to us . we will never purchase another revere ware product . once burned we will not go back to a second treatment
1	the top of the line for this type of thermosat . we have owned 5 and they have all worked perfectly . the numbers are easy to read ( without reading glasses ) and the programming is intuitive . easy to install and well made
1	this was such a great deal and i love this duvet cover . it is so soft and looks so stylish on our bed . i just wish is had a matching bed ruffle . my husband even likes it and that takes a lot . the color is rich and goes with so much
0	this timer arrived in two pieces - top half and bottom half . they could be reconnected , but would never stay connected . this is a piece of junk that i have thrown away . made in china
1	i 've got a dog , cat and a small child- my floors have been a mess ! i am so glad i bought this vaccuum- the suction is great and it picks up all the animal hair . great price , too . i would highly reccomend this to anyone , especially people with pets- we emptied it 4 times just doing the living room the day we got it in the mail . now my hubby vaccuums regulary- he loves it too
0	i just threw this item away after finding the filter clogged with hairy , dirty , black and green mold again ! i changed the little bulb that is supposed to prevent mold and the filter often . each time i changed the filter , i found it clogged with mold ! i have never had a problem with mold with any of the warm mist humidifiers i have used for years . this was just plain awful
1	this rice cooker has a non-stick bowl , which makes clean-up a cinch ! the indicator light is red when cooking and green when warming . it cooks the rice perfectly every time . also this cooker is small and easy to store .
1	i love this item . perfect for storing pet food . special screw type tops that seals food . bugs , mice can not get in . easy to wash , let it air dry . my only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it . so those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed . over all the best in food storage . i know i just about bought them all
0	when my krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service , i decided to order the capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted cool grind . i wish i had ordered the krups instead . the capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee , and the design ensures that no matter how careful you are , you will spill ground coffee all over your counter . in the time since i bought it another reviewer has reported that his or her capresso broke within six months . do not buy this model
1	we are using this piece in our wedding as part of the unity candle ceremony . we are using our own candles from another vendor . part of our wedding theme is silver intertwined hearts , which is why we picked this piece . we like that it is contemporary and very different from the usual unity candle holder
0	as you can see in the picture , the pestle ( the part you hold in your hand ) has quite a wide bottom . unfortunately , this spreads out the force that you can apply to any single location , making it practically impossible to grind seeds ( e.g. , cumin ) to dust . i tried it once on cumin seeds , and gave up
0	i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars . this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight . the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer 's comments . mine too arrived broken . sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box . amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping . i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces . combined score +2
0	thank gawd i did n't purchase this product ! my landlord has it in my apartment and i have to hang dry everything because it does n't dry clothes at all ! ! sometimes it does n't even wash ! go to sears and do proper research on a washing machine !
0	i have several other pieces in this collection which i absolutely love . when i was able to find the salad server set at amazon.com for a cheaper price , i could n't wait to order it . when it came , i was more than disappointed . the set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished ( which it is not supposed to ever do ) , or someone had bought it , tried to clean it with a polish ( again , something that is not supposed to be done ) and it wore away the finish . i also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set , and when that came , it was all scratched ! needless to say , i returned both for a full refund immediately . obviously , the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case ... and it was n't dirt cheap to begin with , i still had paid $ 75.00 for it , compared to $ 150.00 that it is sold in stores for
1	like many people , i have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on . despite talking to the neighbor politely and such , they still have no concern for the noise pollution . i was losing sleep , and the barking was getting so bad that i even considered moving ! in desperation , we looked online for something to stop barking dogs . we came across viatek 's super bark stop and decided to risk the money . wow , talk about being worth the money ! my husband affixed the device on a piece of wood , and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard . it 's unsightly , yes , but we 're the only ones to really see it . more importantly , it 's right in line with the barking mutt . the first time he tested it , he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin ! we laughed gleefully . could a good night 's sleep actually be on the horizon ... ? it 's been several days and super bark stop has worked amazingly . the dog will lie as far as it can away from the device ... when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor 's yard . if it starts to yelp a little , it stops almost immediately . it 's as if it 's afraid to bark . yay ! you can select the volume , tone , and number of barks to help eliminate false activation ( say , from talking or loud bird squawking ) . audible and inaudible both work fine , but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting . the device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 d batteries ( not included ) to operate it . i am so thankful we found super bark stop ! my nerves were really getting jangled and i was dreading early mornings , when they put the mutt outside . it 's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are ; just because you may want a dog does n't mean i want saddled with its noise while you neglect it ! p.s . after using bark stop for 2 weeks ( yes , it did work ! ) , we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more . ( not as bad as before , though . ) we had it on silent , and realized that it had stopped working . apparently , it 's not 100 % waterproof , despite the claims of the manufacturer . the person i bought it from said that `` once it 's opened , we find that it 's not 100 % waterproof '' . well guess what ? you got ta open it to put the batteries in it ! either buy a faux bird house to protect bark stop or house it where it wo n't get wet . otherwise , you may find yourself in the same position we were in . we got a refund , and fortunately for us , our neighbors got rid of their dog ... so we did n't bother getting a new one
1	fiestaware rocks ! the turquoise place setting is beautiful ... it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com ... fiestaware is functional , calssic and fun- i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this . i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware . i mix up colors that you would n't normally expect to go together and they usually look great
0	clock started losing time the first day . great tasting coffee . no problem with the carafe . unit stopped working all together after about 10 days . returned it to delonghi they promptly sent me another . clock started losing time the first day . great tasting coffee . no problem with the carafe . unit stopped working all together after about 10 days . this could get real old ...
0	ok ... this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted . it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris , and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds , not minutes . also , it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil . really , its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge . stupid ... .stupid ... stupid design . the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together ... its like a rubics cube . a true waste of 40 bucks . do n't buy this ! it does n't even look very cool
0	not as addd says its just a sheet of material that comes it must be cut to fit and is not ehat one would maybe want to do !
1	i 've had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest . replaced it with a $ 20 mr. coffee 4 cup from walmart , which eventually , let water out the front , the back , the side , etc ... creating a puddle just like the leaky braun . threw that out and went to a 12 cup hamilton beach that i had received as a gift . what a pos ... it had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also , the crap leaked as well , and when i lifted it , water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor . after reading reviews on the net and countless hours of searching for a good price , i was ready to buy the bunn stainless steel . i almost bought the bodum electric santos until i read that for some users , the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature . anyway , while at target , i spent an hour looking at coffee makers , including the bunn - which i really liked b/c it is made in the usa . i decided to buy this one just to test it out . i like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning ( which the bunn does not ahve ) and a timer , which also the bunn does not have . the carafe is not bulky , and has a no-drip mouth . also , i have not seen any leaks so far , but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter . perhaps i should just remove the filter and not the basket . the problem with most coffee makers is the steam . after it condenses , the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body . anyway , i also like the cool blue light in the front , and the coffee takes good - or as good as my braun which is what i 've been used . overall , i do n't think it 's bad for 40 bucks . if it develops a leak , i 'll go buy the bunn . if that also sucks , i think i 'll give up coffee for i 've had enough trying to find a good , easy , no drip/leak ( no punn intended ) drip coffee maker .
1	i have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than $ 30 a month ! after we purchased this water filter , i can tell there 's little difference between the water i buy at the store and the water from this filter . i also feel confident if my daughters drink it because i know they 're not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water ! i recommend this filter .
1	i was very happy with the princess comforter , it was plush and soft . my granddaughter was thrilled
0	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so-called `` slow cooker . '' just like most people have reported , the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control . after a couple of burnt meals , i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch . unfortunately , i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it . as a result of this experience and wasting my good money , i will avoid buying rival products in the future .
1	let 's face it , you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated . nice furniture and practical book shelves . but you do not live alone ; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around . it may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of garfield on it or some cutesy saying . but in the long run this durable , multi use , dishwasher safe , bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water .
0	they look nice , but the towels do not absorb much water . i am very disappointed . i suspect i 'll use them a few times , then give them to goodwill
0	i purchased an igloo refrigerator and within a few weeks it completely stopped working . curtis international ( igloo 's parent company ) has terrible customer service and will not honor customer warranties . after a year of trying to ge this resolved , i have found out that they have an unsatisfactory record with the better business bureau and have many of these types of complaints . stay away from igloo products ! !
1	best price i have ever seen for this product , and free shipping to boot !
1	perfect in size with a great hand feel . these glasses are large enough to allow room for a nice bouquet and some swirling if you 're so inclined . if you like port , you 'll love these glasses
1	i 've had this pot for over a year and love it . fast , hot , great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time . i bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because i loved the looks of it , and there were limited choices at the brick-and-mortars . i read all the reviews only after i bought it . the reviewers ' major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking . yes , the plastic knob is poorly-designed and is the only reason i give this pot 4 stars instead of 5 . the designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob . however , it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all . just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot . this is what i 've been doing since i bought the pot and i 've had absolutely no problems with the knob . it 's unlikely you 'll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot , so you can avoid burned fingertips . a secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee . i 've never had this problem ; i suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket , or they are using the wrong grind . it 's important with any percolator to use a percolator grind , or `` fac '' 'for all coffeemakers ' grind .
1	i have been using this cushion for a couple of years now . i use to be able to buy it at walgreens but they no longer carry it . i was so happy when i found it on amazon . i have several of the cushions around . i keep one in my car , one at home , one at work , and now i have one to travel with . i take it on airplanes when i travel . i have broken my tailbone twice and the shape of the cushion takes pressure off of the tailbone . i have recommended it to relatives and friends and they all pruchased it and love it
1	this is a significant improvement over the 750 model . the 750 model was not very well designed . the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic . we returned this . we got the 760 to replace that . the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem . for the same price as the 750 , the 760 comes with one extra bowl , juicer and egg whisk . compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed .
0	this french press made a delicious cup of coffee . the problem is that it is advertised as a `` 3 cup '' coffeemaker . i returned it and will get a larger size
0	believe me , i dearly wanted this pan to work out . it costs well over $ 100 . however , no matter what i did , everything i cooked in this pan stuck . i tried using it without greasing it , greasing it with oil , spraying pam on it , putting ghee/butter in it etc . the following things all stuck : pancakes , eggs , hamburgers and chicken . in fact , every thing i tried , stuck . also , the shape was strange as most of the surface area was off the heating surface . also , they have this 1 '' label on the bottom that was hard to get off . i finally did but once i cooked something , when i turned the pan over there was a microscopic film of glue from the label that i was n't able to get off and it had turned brown . ugggh , this was the worst cooking experience of my life . needless to say , i returned this pan ...
0	i was very disappointed in this item . i own the farberware 8 quart pot that this insert is supposed to fit inside , but when i set the insert into the pot , it did n't fit ! the insert handles - which are plastic - sit on the metal side of the 8 quart pot ( that ca n't be good ) , and the little `` feet '' on the insert may or may not touch the bottom of the pot . the ridge around the insert , which i assumed would hold the insert in place in the 8 quart pot , do n't fit on any part of the farberware 8 quart pot ! has farberware changed the diameter of their classic 8-quart pot ? if i was trying to fit a non-farberware item into my farberware pot , i would have had no complaints . but my 8-quart pot and the 8-quart insert were both farberware classic pieces . believe it or not , i had a cusinart pot which the insert fit , i.e. , the ridge held the insert in place , so i 'll use it with that pot , but the insert sits some three inches above the bottom of the cuisinart pot , so when i cook , the boiling water seeps over . very very disappointing . if i 'd bought this item from a local store , i would definitely have returned it
0	i received this message direct from the manufacturer the dvh is subject to our heater recall that was announced last year aug 3 , 2004. and should be sent in and repaired before you use it again . if you still hold in your possession a vornado dvh , evh , intellitemp or vh heater , we are most interested in having it sent to our factory to be serviced and the potentially defective part replaced . we are providing free shipping via fedex both to us and back to the owner . to register your product for free shipping and repair , you must call 1-888-221-5431 . you will need to know both the model serial number of the heater ( which is only on the bottom of the heater itself ) and also we will need the following information . your name , street address , city , state , zip , phone number ( with area code first ) .
0	way off target . said 350 degrees when in reality it was almost 500 . doesnt work
0	the design is great , the function is not . always difficult to get both in the same package ! i 'm going to return it . it toasts unevenly . toast is not crisp it burns a corner of the toast
1	easy to use and store . very stable and strong .
0	within 2 weeks , the pause brew did n't exist . the coffee poured all over when i tried to pull the carafe for a cup . my attempts at fixing it were for naught . what a waste of money ! i 'm not one who returns items . i just wo n't buy braun again !
0	this coffeemaker is a huge disappointment ! the stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works , when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere , and if you do not use additional paper filters , you get coffee grains . in summary , a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee . the plus ? the water filter , but that is it
0	i bought the four pack of these pillows and kept finding the pillows thrown in other rooms . my husband informed me that he hates the pillows . they are not soft , and are crunchy and loud when you lie on them .
1	okay , i have n't used this while reading in bed yet ... but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting , it 's great ! the light is n't good for areas that are adequately well-lit , so do n't bother to use the light there . but in areas where light is dim , the light shines . literally . it casts a bright light on the page ( s ) that you need to view . it 's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading . yes , it 's a bit pricey for what you get , but it 's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag . imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go . the power adapter , however , is a cumbersome brick . as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for , i ca n't offer an estimate of time yet - but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so- cumulative , not consecutive hours . so , no complaints yet about that . whenever i saw this light online or in the store , i used to think , `` why in the world would i ever want something like this ? '' now , my thoughts are : `` why did n't i ever think to buy this before ?
1	i 've had one of these since 03/03 , and the little thing is holding up just fine - i have n't even had trouble with calcium deposits after so long , as i thought i might , what with the hard water 'round these parts . anyhow , my bodum ibis is heating away merrily ... if it does die anytime soon , i 'll be very very sad , as i 've got the orange model . but i 'll replace it with another just like it , only in black
0	worst set of sheets i 've ever owned . washed them , and put them on the bed directly out of the drier : the fitted sheet ripped at two different corners
0	we purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use . we make probably 20-30 cups of coffee a day . our problems began the first week after receiving it . the machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam , which lattes should n't have . so customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy . we called the manufacturer 's customer service and were rudely brushed off . for a small business like us it is hard to close for 2-3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service , so we had to deal with it . another problem came up 3-4 weeks later , when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming/frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle . sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate , just to steam milk . at the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours , which we did . it did not shut off for 1 day ! the next day the problem started again ... i perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily , so you can not say that the machine is being neglected . we are very disappointed with this machine . for the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite , understanding and helpful . now we are looking for another machine , a back up one , to be able to send impressa z5 for service..
0	this toaster lasted for about 8 months before it started to burn toast on one side , even at low settings . we are very disappointed with this purchase
1	beautiful , good quality bowls . heavy and thick , they wo n't break easily . vibrant colors . i 'll be buying more
0	bought one . it quit working within 6 weeks . the litter box lid never did fit correctly , and the unit just stopped running . littermaid sent a replacement . the lid on the replacement would n't close either and the tracks for the rake were out of alignment . after some fine tuning , the unit worked for three days before quitting . perhaps this is a good idea whose time has not yet arrived . the units i have bought and received are useless . as it is , i 'm out $ 170 with no hope of a fix ...
1	i bought these sheets 6-8 months back . i have been using these sheets regularly . even after many wash i do n't see the sign of lint coming out . this seems to be one of my great value for money . . very soft and cozy . . excellent for winter . . even after many wash there are no sign of lints . excellent for the price
0	first the good news . this is an extra heavy skillet with durable finish and good handles . it easily handles two quarts up to the bottoms of the rivets and distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pan . but for the bad news i would give this skillet four or five stars . the bad news is that someone at the anolon plant damaged the pan before it was placed in the anolon carton . neither the anolon box nor the outer ups shipping carton showed any damage when i received the skillet . it was n't until the the following day , after i threw out the packaging , that i noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly . true , i should have been more attentive when i received the pan , but i never suspected anolon would package damaged goods . i 'll live with my mistake but will not purchase anything by anolon again !
1	i just received this wine tower the other day . it looks as wonderful in my home as it does in the picture . it 's perfect for our needs and takes up so little space . the only complaint i have , and why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 , it was a pain for my husband to put together . also , it came with 2 bottom shelves , instead of one bottom and one top ... he had to improvise until i can get this corrected with the manufacturer . ( fortunately , it 's not noticeable ) in spite of this , i recommend this wine tower for anyone wanting an expensive looking wine tower that is so space efficient at this price . i 've already gotten compliments on it from friends .
0	not worth the high price . difficult to clean and very persnickety . comes with a bunch of sensors that , if not properly triggered , keep it from roasting . not long after i bought it , i could n't get it to start without jamming a pencil in one spot , and now it does n't work at all . when it works , it works fine , but it does n't always work nor does it last very long .
0	i was very disappointed with this cheese slicer -- the wire broke after about the fourth use . i have always had good experiences with oxo and was very surprised .
0	what a failure ! seemed just right for a simple way to make a quick single brewed cup of coffee . small , low profile and uses little space on the counter . the science is so simple and established that i figured there could be no problems . wrong , it can not deliver more than 6 ounces of water through the system , even though the water well holds 12 ounces . if you drink more than six ounces ( smaller than a juice glass ) of coffee , this is not the unit for you . the well is filled with 12 ounces and the machine starts to brew . good . then , about half way through the process ( very slow ) it simply stops . i used my own 12oz mug which fits well but the pot seems pooped and just keeps on heating the water without delivering it through the plumbing . i have `` plunged '' the small water hole in the bottom if the well with no results . i 've tried it five times , wasting coffee and time and it simply does n't want to work . i 'm planning to use it for a planter . small cut wildflowers will look nice . for coffee , i 'm going to a real working product . it does n't pay to return this item because the time and postage will make it too expensive . this is junk , pure and simple
0	people cliam this fan is quiet , it 's not quiet . i wanted a fan that will circulate the bedroom air during the night , it 's too loud and keeps me awake
0	got one as a christmas present - great concept , but the performance falls well short of the promise . as another reviewer noted , wine from my wine fridge ( 56 deg . ) registered as 74 deg . when placed into the unit ; wine at room temp ( 72 deg . ) regularly registered 78 deg . or so . although the unit ran through it 's cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was . in fact , if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier . i tried about half-a-dozen times over a couple days , but it never worked properly . we returned the unit to the store for credit
0	once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and i will get a half of a pot of coffee . the big problem with this piece of junk that the coffee maker was under a cabinet and the steam was ruining the kitchen cabinet . i say this is $ 199 down the drain . i have never had problems with a coffee maker spitting steam out the back and no water dripping into the pot . stay away from this garbage . i am not even interested in contacting krups for any warranty repair because it is not worth it
1	at first i was n't so sure if it would work . then it really worked ! ! it was amazing . now , every day i can a chocolate covered item whenever i want !
0	this item has not functioned at all for me . removable of the battery cover required rubber gloves for traction and the opener would not open a 2 3/4 inch diameter can . a cute little useless item
0	for the animal dc17 to be such a great vacuum , i thought i was using the turbine tool incorrectly . after reading the reviews i realize that there is n't any error on my part , it is the tool that is inefficient . i emailed dyson to inquire as how to use the tool correctly and they have never responded .
1	this fan is incredibly powerful . it can definitely move air around a room . my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium . i do n't know if it 's just mine that is that way or not and it is n't a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i 'll tell ya , when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse
0	i returned eureka 437az back to amazon . i was very dissapointed when i 've tried to vacuum my room . the vacuum is powerful but flow of air comming from the front blower is so strong that it disperses dust all over and prevents proper vacuuming . in the cosumers report eureka 431 green vacuum cleaner is not recommended model and now i know that these two vacuums are practically identical , the only difference being color and hepa filter . another downside of this vacuum is that the dust acumulates over the filter which then is difficult to clean .
1	i was impressed when i received this case for my fiance 's christmas present . as i began cramming the body pillow into it , i was happy to find a zipper at the opening . all of the other body pillows i 've had inevitably fall out of the case thus offering little support during the night when you 're not awake to notice . it 's very thick and seems durable . i recommend it
1	glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter-point to reidel . anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable
1	it is big and heavy , but a real workhorse . mixes things we would only do by hand before
0	i bought this screen and hoped it would keep the stove top clean whilst i sauteed or fried food . i used it twice and it worked well . the third time i placed it on top of my cast iron skillet where the hamburgers were grilling and the screen caught fire at the edge . it was a small fire but big enough to burn a hole thru the screen and i no longer want to use it and take a chance of another fire . think twice before buying thi
0	if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment , this is n't for you . the radio is hard to use since it does n't have any indication of what frequency you are on , and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static . the pedometer function is marginal at best . but its what you would expect for $ 15 .
0	these sheets were quite thin , and like the label said , needed `` touch-up ironing '' -- on every square inch . i wo n't accept the excuse that `` you get what you pay for . '' i did n't intend to buy $ 13 sheets . these were sold as $ 40 sheets marked down to $ 12.99 , but i ca n't imagine anyone paying $ 40 for them . this is not what i expect from amazon
1	works just fine for my needs ... i use it to press my 'wrinkle-free ' dockers . the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill . . . but once it is filled it lasts a good long time . heavy duty , well-constructed , dependable unit . first package 'disappeared ' at ups . when they shipped the first machine , it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups . ( probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing ) the replacement shipment arrived just fine , and , as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost '
1	now , i do n't know whether you are a die-hard hello kitty fan or not , but you got ta have this ! the numerous different settings , the awesome design , and the fact that it 's hello kitty makes it worth it 's weight in gold . i had been looking for one of these cheap and i ended up getting one for the holidays ! so that worked well . these toasters are cheap as they come online here , so grab em and go ! good luck if ya get one ! ( *the hello kitty waffle maker and juicer rock too !
0	bought this item two years ago for power plus price . the blender ring broke right away and i had to ship it for repair . the speedometer has never really worked correctly and eventually broke . the blender , when it does work , is powerful . the blender ring recently broke again . if you get a good warranty , go for it , otherwise , save your cash for a blender with a good warranty and track record .
1	i read the reviews before i purchased this machine . i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of . so with this in mind i will put in my 2 cents . i have had my machine for two months and i use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults , a 4 year old and two dogs . generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket . you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease . the machine is set up to auto-shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low . i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine . a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive . i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine . they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine . they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean-freaks this machine does n't quite hit the mark . the water/cleaning solution section is , in my humble opinion , to small . i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen . but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up . : ) one more comment before i give my final review ... remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends . there 's a reason for this . if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die ! the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets . so my final opinion is this . if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it 's a great time saver . it 's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac-up of dog hair , scrub and mop . any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment , mop and bucket routine . if you are a cleanfreak , like me , you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand-and-knees scrub . no machine will ever leave you satisfied . this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it 's great . i am giving this machine 4 stars because i think it does what it was designed to do ... light cleaning . i would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice . when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum , scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i 'll be all over it ! until then , i 'll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month .
0	this item is for serving only , it will not keep the liquid hot or cold more than 30 mins
1	this bowl is very durable and i love the different colors that it comes in . the bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times . we basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream , popcorn , nachos , etc . i love these bowls and am going to buy a set of fiestaware for my mom
1	this product worked as well as expected and the vendor was easy to deal with . the product shipped on time
0	why do most of us buy sharper image ? most of the times their products work well , and they look great . this heater looked great in the picture . it ends there . i bought three , thinking i would keep one for myself , and two for friends . there 's no way i would give this to a friend . maybe a stranger whom i did n't care about giving the wrong impression . pros : it 's small . con : it looks cheap . it feels cheap . it does n't work at all . if it did n't have the sharper image logo on it , i would guess that it was a 5 dollar clearance item at walgreens .
1	our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine . having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this . the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute . these sheets have held up well so far and feel great . if you get the ruby color , make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs .
1	this was the second highest rated bundt pan in cook 's illustrated . i used an oil/flour baking spray and my bundt cake popped out with ease . it 's lightweight but perfect for me since i only use it a few times a year
0	it is a very lovely two piece set . and amazon shipped it to me twice , and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards . i gave up , but from what i could tell from the remains , this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear . i 'm not sure , considering the shipping problems , whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher
0	please do not buy they do not packge the refigerator right it comes with dents and parts are missing ! ! ! ! ! !

1	we bought two santas and two pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at amazon -- they were the best gifts we gave , immediate hits with each couple , one in their late 50 's , one in the mid-20 's . in each case the response was the same : `` it 's like my childhood ; they are going in the living room each season . '' vivid but soft , these are superb decorations .

0	i bought this blender because i liked its retro design , and i thought it would function well . well , every single time i 've tried to use it has been a disaster . even for very simple tasks , like blending soft avocado , the blender has not worked . the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything ... it 's horrible . and i even threw away my old , ugly blender when i bought this one ... and the other worked just fine . :
0	i bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great ... that is until it started leaking about 4 months after i bought it . giving the benefit of the doubt , and thinking the leak was a qa issue rather than a design issue , i managed to exchange it for the exact same model . well it 's been 4 months since i got the new one , and this morning what did i notice ? yup , a leak . the tank was full yesterday and this morning it 's 2/3 's full , with a pool of water on the table that holds it . luckily , no damage was done to the floor either time . i understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then , but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time , well then , it 's just a cruddy product . stay away from this aquarium
1	i just started collecting fiesta ware and this yellow covered butter dish is the perfect color for a butter dish ! looks great on my table ( along with my red salt and papper shakers
0	i was originally going to buy clickclack ( made in new zealand ) storage containers . to save money i bought these ( china-made ) containers instead and it was a big mistake . the first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers . the soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed . the clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks . the final straw came when i dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off , rendering the container useless for airtight storage -- and that 's assuming that the somewhat loose-fitting lids actually make the containers airtight . if you want containers like these , spend the money on clickclack or some other quality brand . i 'm surprised target sells these at all
0	sorry , but i can still smell the odor . plastics absorb odor . after a couple of weeks the smell permeated the whole contraption . also , the tube/bag thing does n't last as long as they say . i dump baking soda in with the poop every time , which seems to help . otherwise , it 's not worth the money
0	the complaints about the pepper grinder squeaking and spitting out huge chunks of peppercorns are 100 % true . try to avoid this one if you can . i would try to get a refund , but it 's just not worth the hassle . what a waste
1	these are so adorable ! the patterns are too cute , and they can be mixed and matched just like boring cups and saucers . they even make me happy when i see them in the cabinet . they are a great shape and size ! i am inspired to upgrade my espresso machine because these only deserve the best !
0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out . it was wonderful . wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one , i bought this item . i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it . i was suspect when i opened it . poor quality material . poor bed fit . very very warm on the lowest setting . after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires , which are quite large , in my ribs -- it had to come off . i had rather be cold and i hate being cold
1	i was a little hesitant to spend over $ 10 for a splatter screen as most of them really are n't worth more than a few bucks . however , i am very glad that i spent the extra money on this one . the quality of this item is top notch . it 's much more sturdy than any others that i 've seen . i 've been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it . the feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes . the handle is terrific ( some screens only have either a d ring on the top or a thin handle ) and seems to stay cool while in use . this even got raves from my mother
1	this is an incredibly beautiful knife , with an excellent weight . well-balanced . the damascus steel is just so nice . my husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative . this is our third expensive kitchen knife and i would say that in terms of general use -- meat to vegetables -- this is my second favorite , with my large , 8 '' henckel being my best knife . the shun is much nicer than the wusthof prix ii , which sports the comparable santoku shape . my complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle , making this a much better knife for filleting motions , of which i do few . it 's marketed toward general chopping and slicing , but i find that slant makes my cuts less precise . it 's still my husband 's favorite , but since i 'm the one who does the majority of the cooking , i 'd still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands . but it 's a real marvel to behold and i love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel
0	i bought this item based on price , how can you go wrong for 10 $ for a programable coffee maker ? well , you get what you pay for . after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks , it just stopped working ! just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item ! based on the rest of the reviews , i just threw away and went out and bought a mr. coffee . lesson learned . treehous
0	the pop corn is very good , but the lid broke . i am going to look for one that has a solid metal top . but the pop corn is great , and you can put sugar in there with the oil and salt to form glaze , and cinamon , pepper , chinese five spice , and so o
1	this little clock measures 2.25 x 2.25 x 1.25 inches ( 5.5 x 5.5 x 3.3 cm ) . there 's one simple knob to set the time and alarm , and the knob is easy to manipulate even without tiny fingers little glow in the dark accents on the hands help with night vision , though they are not very bright . to turn the alarm on just pop up the gray lever on the top . smack it to shut the alarm off ( you could press it gently , but it did just wake you up , right ? ) . there is no snooze feature , but for $ 5 , it 's a great value as a travel alarm , in case you nap in your car , or as a backup should your primary alarm clock fail you . you just need to add your own aa battery to get it running
0	although its description said it is a replacement carafe also for a different model , for which i bought it , it did not fit at all . i felt it a nuisance to return it , so i did not return it . but i certainly wasted the money i paid . i was very unhappy
0	i bought this board along with another brand . this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink . it also warped within one month of my purchasing it . the wood has also splintered . not my idea of a good cutting board . i would not recommend it to my friends , nor would i purchase it as a gift
1	i was going to buy the lello 45900 ariete espresso/cappuccino maker , because the price was so good , but i waited over three months because it was not in stock so i looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price , but after using it , it 's more than twice the machine i think , on the amazon description it says the pump is a 16-bar pump , but after checking reviews on different web sites i think amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites , it says the a pump to be 17.5 bar pump , that 's even better , and the other thing that i like , was the fact that it had a cd , that was not said on the description either , i never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful , shows and explains the basics , from making espresso two frothing the milk , cleaning tips and more very helpful . so i made myself my first shot of espresso , it was great nice little cream on top , it just looked beautiful , i did n't think it would work to good because i bought some pods , and i was n't sure how it would work , works great , taste great and easy to clean , second day i made myself a latte again excellent . third day i got adventurous i made myself my first cappuccino , and again great put starbucks to shame . the espresso i was using was the illy sucro espresso pods 906 , naturally the espresso you use is actually more important than the machine i guess this one taste great , about different type of syrups caramel vanilla hazelnuts irish cream , the syrups brand was davinci , so yes i am very satisfied with this machine , and i guess i got lucky because this one was out of stock for a long time
0	i was very unhappy with how the product worked . it squirted all over . it only made the adhesive gummy . and you could smell the petroleum . our waste disposal company would not even take it and i had to take it to a landfill site for them to dispose of it
1	this product is great to have on hand . in the past , i 've used purchased yogurt as a starter , but this eliminates the need to run to the grocery store when you want to make yogurt . after a small delivery snafu , the company immediately sent me a replacement . they also sent me a follow up e-mail just to make sure that i received the product ( thanks fred ! ! !
0	i hate to rate something so low , but my experience warrants a low score . the larger burner was defective from the onset - the knob turned but the burner remained on , and at full it seemed , regardless of the knob 's setting . i had to unplug and plug in the unit to turn it off and on . the smaller burner worked ! amazon was nice enough to refund me in full and even paid for the return shipping as well . packing seemed fine too , guess it was a manufacturing defect . hopefully this does n't happen to many others
1	these treats have been great for our large-breed , older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips . they 're also one of the few glucosamine treats that do n't make him sick
1	loved this rug . i have purchased 5 , nicer than the one at crate barrel and at such an affordable price
0	do not buy this . the steamer stops working in a month and it can not be fixed . cleaning does n't help at all , even after carefully following the instructions . very cheap , no good
1	these hangers were exactly what i was looking for at a great price ! they 're the first hangers i 've purchased in a long time that do n't leave bumps in the sleeves of my clothing . i would recommend these hangers
1	i 've been a chef for almost 15 years , and a knife is one of the tools i reach out most of the time . during those years i 've used all kinds of brands including kershaw , wusthof , mundial and even smart and final brand . and to be more specific , an 8 inch chef 's knife is my favorite . after having fun with these toys , i thought it 's time to reward myself with an ultimate gift . so i sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive . one day i came across the shun classic on the amazon web . this knife sets itself apart from the others : the simplicity in design , the beauty of the blade , the sharpness , and finally its steel quality . the blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a samurai 's sword , wow ! the d shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood , it fits in my hand nicely . but the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness . i can slice pieces of lemons micro thin ! it 's not only super sharp , but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels i experienced with . it weighs a little heavier , but i 'm sure that 's not a big deal for me . cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there is n't any corner which will accumulate grease . shun 8 inch classic is the best i 've ever had . you wo n't regret what you pay for even though the price is very high . a good chef deserves a good steel .
0	i bought this belgiam waffle maker 30 days ago . it worked fine for 30 days and then the iron stopped heating up . i contacted villaware and they suggested getting amazon.com to replace the unit which they did . time will tell on the replacement
0	the first time i tried using this machine to make beef jerky it shut off in the middle of the process . i had to stay next to it for 8 hours making sure it did n't shut off . when it shut off i had to take the cover off and let the machine cool down . and this happened about 15 times . what a pain ! i called the company and they said that they would send me a new one but i needed to ship the old one to them at my cost - what ! this is a brand new machine used once and i have to pay to ship the machine back . buy a different machine
1	i have n't used this for herbs but i have used it for onions and garlic and , like the other reviewers , found it very handy for quick and tear-free mincing . it 's a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect . i love that it 's only 3 small parts ( 4 if you count the rubber blade ) that all fit easily into the dishwasher ( top rack ) .
0	disappointing at best i was truly disappointed in this item . after purchasing it we followed the directions for conditioning the non-stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as before each use as listed in the `` use and care guide . '' it sounds simple enough . wait for the green indicator light to come on , add the batter close but do not latch the lid . the green light will go off , when it comes back on the waffle is ready . the only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue . the waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts . we said `` well , ok , maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it before they start to come out right . '' 7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first . the price is great , the design is nice , the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work , at least not for us . i told my wife i would take it back to the store and exchange it . she said , `` do n't you dare bring another one of those things home with you . '' it 's to bad too , we both love waffles .
0	the fan does work fairly well as an intake fan . however , in exhaust mode ( the mode i need ) , i can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit . it simply does n't work as an exhaust fan . therefore , to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2,470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan . i 'm returning it . by the way , the packing slip from `` air-n-water '' states that a 15 % restocking fee that applies to all returns . i am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with `` air-n-water '' if they try to hit me with a restocking fee
1	this is a great cookie sheet . i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum , and because i know it 's durable . my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago , and when i compared the two , mine was much heavier , and better quality . i would highly recommend this pan - especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these , along with 2 of the 9 '' round cake pans from this company , for only $ 30 ! a great deal
0	this was a seventh anniversaty gift , and being made of copper is its only real benefit . two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it 's light and relatively shabby in construction . it 's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper , and to that end , this fit the bill . but its real value , even for the intended purpose , is very limited
0	i checked out this machine at a local store . it 's little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine . for that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately . regarding this delonghi machine , on the drip coffee side , metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with -- paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds . on the espresso side , you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make , and then empty the strainer when you 're done . the optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee . for only a bit more money ( $ 500 or so ) you can get a full automatic espresso/cappuccino maker . i bought a full-automatic several years ago and my family loves it ! full-automatics grind the beans for each cup , they make excellent american-style coffee as well ( simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee ) , and you dispose of grounds once a week . the only disadvantage of full-automatics is that like every espresso machine , they do only one or two cups at a time . so if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once , you 'll need a plain old coffee maker like the right-hand side of the delonghi
0	bad buy in two days it started to come apart i am sooo disappointed , looks good but quality is por advice-dont buy i
0	the rainbow 600 count egyptian sheets were so irregular that the seams on the pillowcases were not square . i returned them
0	i could not believe it was for only one cup . i did not read throughly and thought it was for four . big dissapointment
0	the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan . it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan . the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive . i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off . now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan . think twice before you purchase this pan
1	these pans are light and clean up great just do n't use metal in them . will buy more
1	i would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone ! it is stylish , sleek , easy to clean , and has plenty of power to handle anything . i feel sorry for michigan , mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink ! awesome ! awesome the first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol ' prune who would n't be happy with anything ! get it now !
0	i bought this for my mother a year ago , and i was recently looking for a vacuum myself , so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing , i asked her how she liked it . she said she liked it , and thought it worked well , and loved how light it was ( she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis ) . so ... needless to say i went out and purchased it , trusting mother deartest 's opinion . i hate it ! i just moved out of my house , and i had to clean ( vacuum ) every room in the house . it took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy hoover vacuum to do the job . one sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s*** just to pick up some damn crumbs . also , you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily , after only vacuuming about half a room . it will not suck up hair . rather , it gets tangled in the wheel , and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never , ever cleaned out . hence , making it harder and harder to pick things up ( not that it does to begin with ) . it 's loud , time-consuming , and the biggest waste of money . the only thing it has going for it is its weight , which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway . oh ... and i 've used this product once . once ! one time of use pretty much was all it was worth . if that . i 'm taking it back ... and throwing it at them . do n't waste your money on this people ! !
1	i owned this dispenser for close to a year , and love it . the cereal is always fresh and accessible and i do not have to keep the boxes or reach out to grab few nuts for a quick snack . great design
0	i received the set in the mail , and immediately noticed that the contents inside were damaged . i returned the item to amazon , who issued a prompt refund . it appears that the persons handling these fragile items are n't very cautious , so i would advise against buying this . amazon was great with a prompt refund , though
1	i bought this glass for my wife ( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine ) as a christmas gift . last night , she tried out the glass with a friend . the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch . the wine from this glass tasted far , far superior to the same wine from an `` ordinary '' red wine glass . in fact , they poured the remaining wine from the `` ordinary '' glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening . there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different , superior one
0	i have the same problem as sillygal00 - `` the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove ! '' . i 'm returning it
0	we were very disappointed , upon opening the package , to see how small the glasses are . i was concerned about this when i purchased them , but could find no info on size ( and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are ( 2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1/4 inches tall ; i can hide the entire glass in my closed fist )
0	we purchased this purcolator christmas 2003 , and ended up returning the first one after it did not work out of the box . amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange . the second percolator worked . however , i wished i 'd have saved my money . the coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee . do n't take that last cup . you will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating . the percolator maintains the heat too high when ready , and boils the coffee continuously . mmmm , burnt coffee !
0	i got the expensive one rather than the $ 14.99 aroma cooker , thinking it will be better quality . wrong . i only used it twice , not only the rice get burn , after i clean in and out of the cooker , it still look dirty . the quality of the material was really bad . i think the store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement . do not waste your good earned money on this one .
1	the franciscan apple dinnerware covered sugar bowl is a perfect match for the franciscan apple creamer . you can keep granulated sugar or sugar cubes in this bowl . mine is in constant use for the coffee and tea drinkers as well as for those who like a bit of sugar on their morning cereal or grapefruit half . a must-have for the franciscan apple collector
1	i use this desk chair frequently , as a student i spend many hours sitting and studying at my desk . the chair does n't take up much space in my small apartment and it is comfortable and sturdy . plus , it was a great value , so even if it does n't last forever , i am very happy for now
1	gorgeous , unique useful ! i bought this as a gift and it is the recepient 's favorite . great gift ... do not hesitate..buy now !
1	i have found this to be a very good product , and easy to use . i would give it a 5 star rating if all the removable parts could be washed in a dishwasher . i ca n't see why they could not be
1	these are as decsribed and a wonderful value - cheapest price i 've seen and free shipping ! arrived quickly too
0	probably have bashed this product enough , but it is insulting to still see sturdy lid and side handles for improved grip advertised . in no time at all , the handles broke off like peanut brittle ; glad i was n't carrying it around the kitchen . no wonder no one carries replacement handles . do n't know what 's better , but sure wo n't try rival again
0	a very impressive looking oven . the temperature dial did not reflect the actual internal temperature of the oven by 50 to 75 degrees . once i got that sorted out , the oven worked well about 20 times . then the motor started to sputter on and off . burning electrical odor filled the air and an arcing sound could be heard . while it worked , it worked well . i do not know if the defect is common or rare . i tested only one oven
0	i purchased four of these pillows ! i really should n't have wasted my money . they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up , i 'd rather sleep without a pillow at all ! !
1	i bought two of these beds for when my grands visist . it is wonderful . since then i have had several adults utilize the bed and all have said they will buy one . it was like sleeping on a water bed only better and it is level like a bed . grea
0	corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies . usually ( but not always ) oxo products are good at making things easier to do . i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one . getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky . you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork . poor design this time oxo .
1	i like the fact that it included diff sized containers , and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot . i have read reviews where people have burned out their motors , and i will have to say that , yes , it 's possible , but only if you did n't follow the directions . the manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient , expect to shake things up once in a while between blends , and this unit should last you at least a year : d i think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it 's thang . gee , if that was the case , i 'd let my car drive me on auto pilot .
0	i should have read the other review more closely . this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights . i expected more for over $ 50 . if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
0	i have a lot of low-voltage lights on our house . many colors and different wattages , which i dearly love . unfortunately , the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights . one night i used my panasonic vacuum ( which i love ) and got over 30 ! the motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag -- i 've never had one survive ! nice jolly subject , right ? often , i have to hold the vacuum in one hand ( 20 lbs . ) while using the hose with attachment in the other . this gives me over 3 ft. of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is `` gone '' within 1 '' of the brush . ok , the lentek is rechargeable , does n't have a power cord and is lite ( albeit unwieldly ) . after charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1/8 '' spider but nothing larger . after a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you wo n't get anything then . yes , i 'm back to the panasonic and the lentek ? -- -the `` round file '' !
0	received set and tumblers are not good quality . the edges are quite sharp and the glass still sweats . would not recommend
1	my son and i love this item ! it 's so fun to be able to quickly and easily make shaved ice . sometimes we freeze juice or soda in the molds ( rootbeer is a favorite ! ) , and sometimes we just use regular ice and sno-cone syrup . this is one of the best kitchen gadgets i 've ever purchased ! !
1	cooking is actually a pleasure when you have tools that are as colourful and cheerful as this little pot . it is just beautiful to look at , and a joy to use . ( i never thought i could get so excited about a simple pot ! ) this little green pepper cooks evenly , in the oven or the stovetop , and clean up is a breeze . i 've use this to make casseroles for 2-4 , sides for 4-6 , even soups and sauces . jambalaya is one dish particularly well-suited for this pot -- straight from simmering on the stove to the table , it 's gorgeous . i 'm planning to get the tomato or pumpkin next
0	i must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan 's nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after i began using it . i 'm not talking about scratches , which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning . my pan began pock all over , even up the sides where i rarely touch them . i hung on to this pan for 3 years , simply because i could not bear to part with it for the expense . but eventually i had to treat it like my other all-clad pans ( which i love ) and use full amounts of oil to cook . it was no longer worth using . although the reviewer who loves this pan was `` certain '' the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly , that `` certainty '' is based on nothing but speculation . i cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by all-clad . of course , i could have asked all-clad to replace it early on , since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord . but that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off
1	the merchandise purchased was to be a wedding shower gift . when i received it i found minor damage and contacted the shipper who requested it 's return . the replacement merchandise was in perfect condition and i happily gift wrapped it and forwarded it to the future bride . i have not had an acknowledgement to date and hope that it arrived in good condition . i am totally satisfied with service i received
1	when my original krups coffee carafe broke , i found a replacement at amazon . the price was competitive , the carafe arrived promptly , and my coffeemaker was complete once again . amazon is always prompt and dependable
1	being used to the swiftness of the roomba ( 10 stars ! ) , the scooba seems very slow . it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle , the floor is clean and sweet-smelling . on the downside , my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only . in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet , scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine
1	i left my old pressure cooker ( a tefal made of steel ) in storage in another state and i was dying to have a new one . i bought this because the price was great and the description seemed to make this set attractive and i 'm very glad i did . both pots ( the large and the smaller ) fit the pressure lid so it 's like having two pressure cookers instead of one . one night i cooked lamb in the small pot and in 20 minutes i had a very nice and super tender meal and the next day i made beef broth with the large cooker so that i could freeze it and pull it out anytime i want it . i 'm very satisfied with this product , it looks great , it 's very efficient and it 's very strong and durable . the set also comes with a cooking book containing easy recipes of all kinds , from main courses to desserts and even a table with cooking time for many items
1	after reading some of the previous reviews about shipping damage i almost did n't order it . however , it arrived in great shape and the packing material was excellent . someone must have gotten sanyo 's attention on the quality of their packing material
1	we use it as supplemental heat in our apartment , raises the temp of our entire 1000 sq ft. apartement about 10 degrees with no problem ( our landlords have the thermostat ) . however check the shipping price ... shipping nearly doubled the price on the item .
1	this is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone . i am not in the habit of writing reviews , but this juicer earns it . perhaps you are like me , and have never used a juicer before . you want to get one without taking out a small loan , because you just do n't know if your that into it . if so , this is your juicer . there are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting . i just want to back those up with my experience . this is a good , strong product
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working
1	i love this filter ! it keeps the water pristine and more importantly it is easy to assemble and clean thanks to the included double tap valves and media basket . silence was a key buying point for me as it was purchased for an aquarium in my bedroom . this filter is absolutely silent . so silent that i can now hear the hum of my fluorescent aquarium lights
0	i love the cookware set . 12 pans to do 12 different meals . they are very durable and holds up well to the heat
1	i bought this to hold some of my `` overflow '' knives that would not fit into my knife block . it has proven to be very handy . it seems well made , im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot , but it is sturdy and nice looking . it occupies about half of a drawer , which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non-sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it . i have now switched its intended purpose slightly , insead of just holding the `` overflow '' from my counter top knife block , this now holds my most commonly used knives . the `` real '' knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the `` overflow '' from this one
0	this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years . it `` brews '' very quickly , losing a `` cup '' or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top . the coffee is weak and bitter ( no matter what brand we have tried ) . about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed , creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop . we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly , and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on . the same thing has happened twice more . this coffeemaker is a piece of junk
1	after 10 years in the kitch , i have good skills with knife . but , first day with this knife , i cut my finger . shun cuts yam like tofu , it happen so fast that i was n't even able to react to it . i need to be extra careful with this blade
0	sheets are full of wrinkles after being washed , not as soft as when new , and not the qualiy i anticipated
1	ever since my curlers arrived i have been obsessed . i love the curls i get from the larger size . just roll your hair when you wake up , do your make , eat breakfast , and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers ( very painless ) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials . i love this product ! ! !
1	it 's well-made , sturdy , good looking pet crate . i bought the small first for my 12-pound cat , and it was much too large , so i exchanged it for the extra small and it is just right . remember that it 's a crate , so do n't look for the handle
0	i took water temperatures at high , low , and keepwarm . i am at 5200 ft altitude so water boils at about 195 . all temps reached 203 and the water was in a rapid boil ! i have a small rival i picked up for $ 12 and it works great low 190 , high 199 , and warm 160
1	this is a massive skillet ! be warned it 's heavy , but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan . it 's preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great . i would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter , but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down
0	alas , this had no discernable effect on my cats . however , the product arrived in good time and in good shape
1	this miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces
0	man this item is fantastic . i love wasting $ 80 on pointless furniture . getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems ... . man i must be in heaven . not only that but it breaks easily , does this thing have no limit ? so i bought this great video center around a year ago ... . and what happens it breaks . i had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap . it looks like you 're in a baby kids room . similar to those play centers in day cares or mcdonalds . man that is lame ... . i just love having children decor in my house , and it has to be $ 80 . if i were you ... . i would just let my systems , tv , and cds sit in some tubberware . believe me it would be 50x safer !
1	this timer was a christmas gift for mom . she loved it . she thought it was very cute
1	this item saves space because it folds everything to the same size . it is god 's gift to those of us who have small closets and hate messes . i first saw it when a clerk at a store was using it to put clothes back on the floor for sale . i tried to buy it off her and she told me the name of the company . i love the flip-fold . you wo n't be sorry if you buy this item
0	the first use was n't too bad . it cut things well but the lock locks too easily , without something even touching it , so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use . safety is nice , but that is just annoying . the biggest problem is the coil/spring is not stainless-steel so the inside of it rusts , even if you take it apart for each washing . once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult toclose the shears , making cutting a real pain , literally . i soak the spring regularly in rust remover but i can not use it no more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand . my prior shears lasted for 10 years , but these i need to replace after a couple of months..
0	it 's noisy and expensive - you can get that from reading the other reviews on this page . ours stopped working within 2 weeks of light use . i called the company and when i described the problem they said it was a faulty unit . thankfully the store let me return it and i got my money back . we have bought the hamilton beach trueair 04381 allergen reducer air cleaner which is cheaper , smaller , and very quiet . most importantly , it works ! ! !
1	we are very pleased with the quality of this couch . the leather is soft , but durable , the craftsmanship is excellent , and it is very attractive . also , the delivery was exceptionally fast . we highly recommend this product
1	i 've seen this particular clock at other web sites . i decided to buy it from target.com because the price was good and there is free shipping . when i received the clock in only 3 days , i was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed . it arrived in perfect condition . i inserted an aa battery only to wonder whether i had gotten a `` dud '' -- it did n't make any perceptible tick . soon it was clear that the clock was working well and i hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and i love it . i highly recommend this very quiet , well-made clock
0	the unit features automatic shut off when water is low by using a proximity switch via a float with a magnet in it . it has a shut off by setting humidity level and a shut off by count down timer . after a few weeks of use , the unit started leaking and you ca n't even tell where the leak is coming from . the pads do not prevent mineral build up on the hot plate . i am getting brownish deposits which i believe to be rust . the only way to remove it , is with white vinegar and old toothbrush which i had to bend into an `` l '' shape in order to get at and clean the stainless steel hotplate which boils the water . i was happy with the unit and preferred it over an ultrasonic unit i had , until it start leaking
1	this is a wonderful hamper . i live in a building where the laundry is in the basement , and this hamper is great , better than any shopping cart . one complaint : it 's handle is too short , i 'm tall and have to slouch to one side when i roll it
0	amazon is out of red . after waiting for 2 months , they shipped a white while the packing list states red . when contacted , they said that they do not have a red for replacement . if i want a white i can get it elsewhere for $ 7.99 . not i have to go through the trouble of returning it
1	impressive machine overall . i 've had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch . looking around on the internet , this seems to be fairly common . i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things , but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine . the attachments are great for hard floors , and furniture . i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine , but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point , even the refurbished one
0	the humidifier worked great for 2 weeks but now leaks all over the floor during operation . i would not recommend buying this product
1	i have been in love with the set for years ... they are versatile , sharp , and reliable ! each piece has its own speciality , and the whole set satisfies all your need for kitchen endeavor . i personally like the vegetable chopper and the curved bone chopper best . :
1	in anthoney bourdain 's book `` kitchen confidential '' he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs do n't use henkle or wustoff knives , they use global . cat cora of `` american iron chef '' also uses global knives . i needed a good knife in my kitchen so i decided to check out global as well . first of all , it 's incredibly light . if i 'm chopping a lot of onions for a french onion soup or making a big batch of mirepoix for some beef stock i notice that lightness . then there 's the balance . see that notch where the blade meets the handle ? pick the knife up by that notch and it balanced exactly level . try that with a standard knife and you 'll see how handle heavy they are . finaly , the edge . these knives are insanely sharp . they cut like a dream . i just went to a knife sharpening clinic by wustoff and they suggest honeing your knife with 5 or 6 stroks on a steel before every meal that you cook . i 've found that this keeps the edge razor sharp . however , you should realize that the edge on these knives is at 15 degrees , not 20 degrees . so adjust the angle you use to hone the edge . overall , it 's an amazing knife . take care of it and it will serve you as a professional quality tool for a long time
0	for the price , i expected a quality canister . the plastic insert in the lid arrived unglued , and hardly creates an airtight seal . had i seen this item in a store i would have passed on it immediately .
1	not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful , they also bake the most perfect pies i have ever put together . the crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky . i use martha 's pate brisee recipe , but with these pans it is foolproof ! i have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches . wonderful
1	luigi bormioli has proven to me that they possess the exceptional quality of service that i would like to be able to expect from all vendors . when my product arrived broken from shipment , amazone.com would not replace it due to the fact that it was past their deadline . i contacted the luigi bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses . when they arrived , however , they were the wrong glasses . i returned them to the company , along with the broken glasses i had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses . again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again . i would highly recommend these glasses and this company
0	it looked like it would work , it turned like a high quality item it wo n't open even 1/6 of a can as a newly purchased item . go cheap and shop old time stores for can openers . this is an over-engineered benz-lemon of a can opener . i 'm taking it back to nob hill tomorrow morning
1	this paper towel holder is perfect for our country kitchen ; it 's simple , functional , very easy to use , and would look as lovely in 1807 as it does today ; we love it
0	this pet chime was a good idea , but i am sending it back . sometimes the chime wo n't ring and at other times it rings on its own and worst of all it starts ringing and wo n't stop . clearly the manufacturer needs to work on quality control
0	the unit has nice , large digits , but the wireless sensors do n't work consistantly . the system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down . we have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re-established
1	i purchased the eureka filter bags with the eureka upright boss 4870gz for my mom . she loves them both . the cord is really long on the vacuum which makes it easy to do several rooms at a time . she lives in a one level ranch so she does not have to go up steps with it , because she does find it a bit heavy . beware the vacuum had to be assembled upon arrival . i live out of state and she had to get another relative to help her assemble it . the add never mentioned that small detail ! someone over 65 should not have to assemble a gift vacuum ! i bought the hoover wind tunnel 2 years ago , for myself and it 's a peice of garbage . the lever to keep it upright broke , the attachments fall off the hose when in use and everthing gets tangled on the roller ! i am thinking about purchasing the eureka soon , for myself ! i reccomend it
0	it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design . the pot does a good job perking coffee , but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot . i think that melitta should send out , for nothing the glass top . i am like the other reviews , i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot . there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits
1	the bat house is neat , fun to set-up and interesting to watch as it attracts fruit bats to my yard . it serves 2 purposes , a home for fruit bats while is environmentally friendly and esthetics to my yard . the fruit bats that live in it durng the late sprng to very early autumn control the mosquito problm making my yard healthier .
0	got this tea kettle for a gift recently . it 's discontinued on amazon but they sell it at home goods for $ 24 . 99 . pros ~ * asthetically pleasing ( looks pretty ) * removable top for wide area to fill with water and makes it easier to wash * removable whistle ( i ca n't stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle , so i remove the `` plug '' ) cons ~ * it 'd be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up `` plug '' on the spout instead of the removable one ( i 'll lose it eventually , the other le creuset models have the flip up `` plug '' that opens with a press of the thumb ) * the poor design of the spout is dangerous . no matter how slowly i pour the boiling water ( even with the small amount i use , only 4 or 6 ounces at a time ) , a few tablespoons of water `` blub '' out very quickly - sorry i ca n't think of a better descriptive word . the spout opening is way too small , but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water , so the first few tablespoons gush out . so when you pour the water , do it as slowly as possible , put the mug on your counter or another surface that wo n't get ruined when wet , and do n't hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the `` blub '' of boiling water will burn
1	i have found this to be the best i have ever owned . my daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and i just had to have a bunn also . i envied my daughter 's ability to make coffee in literally three minutes . i used to only have 12-cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now . the best is that you can always have a `` fresh '' cup of coffee and it is always hot . it makes a `` clean '' cup of coffee easily and efficiently . we are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone . this will be our brand of coffee maker forever
1	most importantly , this is small . this is the same size as one-person clay pot rice or bibimbap . it is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout . one cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion . i have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around . now that i have received my shipment , i know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but i have grown to prefer the red . it 's so pretty . it did n't arrive chipped or anything so there 's not much to say about how it works . just keep the heat between medium to low . i broke it in by making hot milk ( from powder ) with banana so yeah , as a pot , it heats stuff up . no leaks . p.s . one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that i saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating - yes i did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in . i still do n't know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but i hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies . i think this try me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl
0	i think this may be a great product , and is why i bought it . however , mine never worked ( and hence was never actually used , it was just taken out of the box ! ) the remote would beep the collar but not spray . seller did have manufacturer send new batteries ( which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation ) . new batteries arrived , item still did n't spray , but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer , to get a replacement , even though i responded within their advertised 30 day return policy . please read seller information and return policies carefully ! even if you get them to take something back ( only if never opened ... if opened and does n't work , they toss you to the manufacturer ) , there is a 25 % restocking fee ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! pretty exorbitant and not amazon type service i have come to expect over many years of buying from amazon ! be very careful of sellers that are not amazon ... sometimes it is n't very clear it is not amazon . my feedback on seller is on feedback page and seller responded , but i do n't get a chance to respond to their feedback , which gives the misconception that i actually used this product ! i could n't have used it as it did n't work ! if you want to buy this , i 'd recommend a reputable pet store such as pet smart where you can easily take an item back if it does n't work and get a refund . even if they are willing to replace something , you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund , which most stores have no problem with doing for you . next time i go the established pet stores
0	i 'm sure it will get a 5 star if i ever get the item . i placed the order on 2/6/07
0	bad quality , on/off switch and plastic ring broken after 1 year .
0	i knew when i purchased these sheets for only 13 dollars they were n't going to be great , but really these are ridiculous . they are incredibly thin sheets and they pill easily . they also do not stay on my mattress , i am constantly having to put them back on . i will not purchase these sheets again
0	we are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster . the bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside . i sent email to west bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck -- no help . if i return it , shipping cost makes it not worth it . good appearance and company name fooled me . fy
0	i bought these because i was sick of creating foil shields on the pies i bake . i love that these slip perfectly on and off . however , i 've found that since they 're made of metal or aluminum , they actually conduct heat and cause the crust of the pie to darken faster than the center -- which is exactly what i did n't want it to do . that said , i have to admit that while the edges of my pies look darker than the rest , it has n't come out burnt as it would if i were to bake the pie without any sort of shield . i 'm planning on buying another brand 's -- something made from silicone instead
0	take a look at the ingredient list . alcohol is first , then water . this product does n't do anything more than plain old rubbing alcohol does -- except for make you about twenty bucks poorer . regarding some of these reviews : smells like rubbing alcohol ? why yes , that 's because it is . stings ? yes , it 's rubbing alcohol . someone recommended a spray bottle for easier application ? well , yes , ( and duh ) what a better way to fly through an expensive product that would last much longer if you used cotton balls . unless you 've got money to burn , it 's just nonsense to buy this . i used it and noticed no difference between it and rubbing alcohol . except the price
0	this grater is not a convenience , it 's more of a punishment . i have tried it for hash browns , cheese , chocolate , etc . i thought at first i was using it incorrectly , but then realized , there really is no wrong way of using this . everytime i have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that i would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually . my fingers and hands ache so bad that i ca n't even hold a pencil after using this gadget . i would not recommend this to anyone . unfortunately , you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star , but in reality i give it no stars !
1	the best thing about this foil cutter is the magnetic back - i had been looking for another one for 6 months ! we just love it
0	i bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs . it works for a while then stops working , or just goes on warm . they replaced it three times -- everytime it went out . this seems to be common with cheap rice cookers -- see the reviews on the rival rcs 200 , they all go out within days or weeks ! i guess black and decker and rival used the same chinaman to design these useless things . i ca n't understand why amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do not work . the companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately . in frustration i bought the aroma 60-cupper for $ 125 -- and after two months that also went out . any suggestions on a 20-cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated
1	my grandma 's 10 year old yorkie just would never shut up . he barked at our cat , at our parrot , and anything that moved really . we bought this collar , and it worked perfectly and immediately . one bark and it sprayed , and he would go running off ... and stop barking ! i felt kinda bad for him , but his reaction was hilarious . i could n't stop laughing at him , poor thing . however , he did learn that if the collar was n't on , he was n't going to get sprayed , so he would bark
1	bought this vacuum because consumer reports picked it as one of the 2006 best buys . better than dyson or rainbow . this is our second eureka , but this one is significantly better than the last . the last was a bagless model , and this one uses bags , and as a result it 's much easier to clean . bags are quite inexpensive , so it only adds about $ 10-15 per year ( 6-9 bags ) . suction is fantastic . noise is low . it 's easy to use . and i will add that we purchased a `` refurbished '' model , but we can identify no defects or differences . looks perfectly new and runs great . so the choice is yours : dyson for $ 400+ or this one which is better for $ 99 ? ?
1	i have a manual sharpener , but in reality almost never use it . the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no-brainer . there 's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull . for most knives the fine- and polishing-grinder works just great . if you have inexpensive knives , the coarse grinder will chew them up , but if you have well-made knives the waring will work well . i 've had good success with the waring
0	i received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed -- it is just not warm enough ! ! even on the highest setting it does n't get warm enough initially . it is fine for keeping warm during the night but i want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does . it is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well . not worth the money at all
1	this 2 qt bowl has many uses . i use it for mixing , serving and baking . it is wonderful for macaroni and cheese , also have done cobblers . i have 6 different colors . once you get one you will have to get another and another
1	i love going to other peoples party 's and sharing a few drinks , but never had a good way to carry to bottles of bubbly or other drink of choice before this product . i purchased an orange one last year , and like it so much i 'm giving them as gifts this holiday season . they fit almost any round or squire 750ml bottle ( absolute , sky , captain , jose cuervo , bushmills ) . however oddly shaped bottles a bit of a tight fit , like baileys
1	you ca n't go wrong with this knife . i use it almost as much as i use my 8 inch chef 's knife . it holds an edge well , feels light in your hand , and has perfect ballance .
0	i used this light at my computer desk because i wanted something that would give off a soft light so i could still see to type after everyone went to bed and less than a couple of hours later the light began to fade , the batteries ( brand new ) died
0	just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us ... i should have taken more notice of the other reviews . beautiful glasses but they are way too small . my set will also be returned , they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them
1	it is a very pretty maker , and coffee is made under perfect conditions . the price is good through amazon , just make sure you use suggested filters , the other do not work ... ( learned from experience ) . if premium coffee is your `` thing '' and pretty is a bonus , this maker is the answer
1	i bought this fan 2 years ago from phoenix and it is still going strong ! its quiet and unwaveringly loyal . i bought my 2nd one just the other day as a gift for my son in seattle . he enjoys his as much as i enjoy mine . the remote is a big hit with us both . if i can i 'm going to send a 3rd one to my sister in seattle . she is in a studio apt..this fan is perfect .
0	the lower bowl part will last forever but the water tank lasts a month outside . between the sun and cold air , the plastic get weak right away and the slightest touch will crack the top . i have gone through 3 of them . all with exactly the same results .
1	after using my roomba for a year and loving it , i decided to splurge and buy scooba . wow ! i think i love it even more than my roomba ! i turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it . when i return , i have a gorgeous , shiny , clean-smelling floor . once a week , i wrap a damp washcloth around my swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners -- but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny all the time . scooba is a miracle . i did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box . i had to prime the pump to get it going . my only suggestion to irobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming scooba in the box instead of making people go to the irobot website to troubleshoot . obviously , from reading the reviews , you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem . fortunately , that 's the only trouble i 've ever had with it ! i 've never had to prime again and it works flawlessly . i 'm very impressed with scooba
1	this is a wonderful item that your cat will love . i originally purchased a thermal mat from another website ( more expensive with a pattern that i did n't like ) . my 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it , so i did a search and when i found this one , i ordered one for each of them . this cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that i just ordered 3 more , for my dad , sister and a friend to give to their cats . i 've seen similar thermal cat mats for $ 50+ . the pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux-sheepskin . my cats like both sides . you can throw them in the washing machine and fur does n't stick to the smooth patterned side , which is nice . of all of the cat beds i have purchased , including a heated window-mounted bed that plugged into the wall , this mat is my kitties ' favorite thing to sleep on
1	still find it somewhat big for a dorm room ( but if you have a double and are sharing the fridge this much room is probably necessary ) but works great
0	do not buy the shark portable steamer under any circumstances . the trigger mechanism is defective and fails after a few uses , causing all of the steam to leak out uncontrollably , which is also exposes the user to a possible steam burn . euro-pro operating llc does not stand behind its products . they will not sell you a replacement trigger or hose assembly if it fails ( and trust me , it will fail ) . instead , euro-pro wants you to spend $ 40 ( $ 12.95 shipping + $ 27.00 `` minimum '' repair charge ) to even look at it . replacement parts are an additional charge ! i can buy a competing product for the cost of euro-pro 's `` minimum repair '' charge , shipping charge , + parts charge . euro-pro 's service after the sale stinks . i will not buy shark products or do business with euro-pro operating llc ever again .
1	my two tanks of cichlids , loaches and catfish love this food . gives them high energy so they 're active and interesting throughout the day . also the tank appears cleaner or clearer even with multiple feedings with this product as indicated versus the regular tetramin that does cloed up the water
0	the coffee is extremely hot from this coffeemaker . beware ! i find the product adequate but not outstanding . it is difficult to insert the pot all the way in after use
1	this mug is microwave and dishwasher safe . a great mug for a large cup of cocoa or coffee . makes a great christmas gift for a cat lover
1	le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products . the enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once . for this reason , one pan may look like another , but each is unique in its own way . cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently . for this reason , it is recommended to use on low to medium heat . there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay . otherwise , cooking with high heat may cause food to stick , discolor the enamel coating , or cook the food unevenly . remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well . cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel ? iron tends to rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) does n't add any complimentary flavors to your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled , you would have to season and maintain it . adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good , but has multiple benefits . the enamel , being a solid coating , is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on , does not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , and is easy to clean . the enamel can be damaged , so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood . the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many , but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 5 1/4 quarts of food , measures 9 3/4 x 14 x 3 inches internally , and weighs 10.2 pounds . 5 1/4 quarts will typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes to casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining the size you need . except for roasts , the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full . any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot . i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable for other dishes . add the le creuset 9 x 11 1/2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease . some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered with cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , lasagna , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination . one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost . the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials . heck , cast iron does n't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping . however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced . they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products , the cost tends to make sense . then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons : its heavy , as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10.2 pounds
0	this unit is smaller than i was expecting ; it is 11 '' tall and 5.5 '' in diameter . i have it in our small bathroom at the moment because it was too small to affect the humidity level in the 120 square foot room i had originally put it in ( i have a hygrometer in the room to measure its humidity and this unit did not affect the humidity level in 24 hours ) . i doubt it is adequate for our tiny bathroom . it seems like it might be adequate for a not-too-humid closet . it says it removes 16oz . a day at 86 degrees fahrenheit , but whose house it 86 degrees ? in our humid bathroom it sucks up a mere third of an inch a day ; i guess it performs better in a warmer space .
0	my holmes humidifer was broken ( no mist ) after 3 months . i did send it with a check of $ 7 more than 2 months ago , and have n't receive information from holmes . i emailed to ask my case and they tried to fool around . i am desperate ! very bad product and bad service ! i never buy holmes product again
0	i ordered this griddle and on the third use the teflon coating burned off onto my glasstop stove . i called faberware directly since i was out of my return period , and after explaining my situation , they sent me another ( different model ) griddle , free of charge . the first product didnt work out , but the mfgr made good
0	i did not find these pillows comfortable for airplane travel . they are too big and bulky to provide any comfort . i guess they would be fine if you were laying on a couch and not sitting mostly upright like on a plane . i would have been better off saving my money and using the airplane pillow . i would n't recommend these particular pillows
1	i own dozens of wine glasses from the most expensive lead crystal to winery logo glasses . i also have a set of reidel vinum 's as well . i bought these for everyday/dishwasher use . wow ! both the red and white are wonderful ... i side by side taste tested ( glass to glass ) my chardonnay ( yes , mine ) and the white wine glass was way above average and perfect for everyday . frankly , white wine dose n't need a snifter glass as some do ... tip : it also helps to not fill the glass to the top and please do n't freeze the chardonnay !
0	this has been a nightmare . when i received the chair i could n't wait to put it together . however the holes for the screws were too big and therefore i was unable to secure the pieces . i called and asked if the the right size screws could be sent . i was told that there were no provisions for that , but they would be happy to send me another one . ( i could return the faulty one in that box . ) very nice i thought . well i got the second one . the screws are too small for the holes ! now i am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on ! i do n't recommend this item
1	it was a christmas gift , truly enjoyed by my grandson who loves to cook ( with supervision ) . it 's easy to store , and able to keep the oil in its container for several uses . bigger than the grandaddy so you can cook more at one time . it 's great . have one myself and it has been with us for years .
1	aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the '4 ' setting , it 's pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it 's warmed up ( keep it closed ) . i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do . sure , they occasionally stick and i do n't always get the batter in right , and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it 's on , but this is n't a $ 100 device , it 's just a nice little waffle maker
0	i purchased this item , after having read about `` banneton '' in the book `` rustic european breads from your bread machine '' . the picture clearly shows 4 baskets , and the description is vague - but you only get one . the basket you get is quite small , all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket . it looks sturdy and well made . it would have been good value for four baskets - it was too much to pay for a single basket . i did n't actually use it , choosing instead to return it , so i ca n't comment on how well it worked..
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months . at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down . sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down . not what i expect from a $ 70 toaster . well , i have finally given up ( 2 months later ) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon . they are sending me a new one , which i am not sure i am happy about . might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven ... ... ...
1	the good ( function ) : 1 ) rubber non-slip base and good weighting 2 ) clear plastic , allows full view of soap level 3 ) long spout allows easy access to sink . no counter spills ! 4 ) smooth pumping action - no clogs 5 ) pump goes all the way to the bottom - `` sucks '' it all out ! 6 ) wide opening makes it easy to transfer soap from a large bottle . the bad ( aesthetics ) : 1 ) not beautiful ( not horribly ugly either ) 2 ) no choice of color . would have preferred white to match kitchen appliances . verdict : function wins out over aesthetics . highly recommended
1	i feel rich sleeping in these sheets ! they are quite wrinkley , but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible . i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i 'm sure . money well spent
1	my three cats adore this playpen . just moments after putting it on the floor , they started playing with the tease . they also love snuggling in the bed together ( 2 cats fit at a time ) . my only complaint is that i ca n't find the replacement teases -- they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non-catnip styles . the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i ca n't find them at petco 's online store . i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find
1	my wife loves rachael ray and was very excited to receive this cutting board set as a christmas gift
1	looks great , just what i wanted -- i ca n't believe i have filled it up already ( i feel like such a chef
1	i only ordered these because they were only $ 9.99 for the whole set . i do n't think they are nice enough to serve to your guests but i 'd use them on the weekend when i have brunch with my husband
1	this scale is awesome , it works right out of the box ! i am so happy with it . this product is a lifesaver for people who are on a calorie-controlled diet or who are very health conscious . i recommend this to anyone who is dieting . you will surely reach your goals if you use this tool to keep to your daily calorie limit . it 's the best method of weight loss
1	i bought this for my two `` classic '' revere ware 2qt pots ( marked `` clinton , ill '' ) and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces . all of today 's revere ware , including this lid , are made overseas . the pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel , but this glass lid works fine .
1	this is my second panasonic and i love it . it is simple to use and does a great job
1	i was pleased with these canisters . the lids do not screw on but seem to be airtight with the rubber seal . the only complaint i have is that they appeared to be shiny in the photo , but are actually brushed stainless
1	delighted with them . an franciscan apple collectors delight . nice air tight lids .
0	this is not made in france -- most of the le creuset line is from a centuries-old factory in france ; this pot is not . when i saw where it was made , i returned it . buyer beware
0	this item , affectionately named r2d2 , worked like a champ with all the bells and whistles , well , actually lights and dials for about 5 weeks and then just stopped . ... thus i 'm profoundly disappointed - and now without any grinder . in fact , given its short life , the 2 star rating is incredibly generous
1	this shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble ! this hold alot of shoes and spins really nice , i have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11 's fit just fine ! this shoe rack is perfect , i highly reccomend it !
1	i 've owned a littermaid mega for about 5 years and i really wish i had been able to buy this stand sooner . we have two cats and we 're terribly lazy . we 've had this stand for a few months and it works as described . it has drastically reduced the smell and the need to clean the box . we love this stand and it has made life a lot more bearable when it comes to the litter box . our old littermaid just died on us and we went to replace it with a new littermaid elite but the stand is n't large enough . the newer elite model is much longer than this stand and it will hang off the back and over the sides . we love that stand more than we want the newer littermaid elite and we are getting a great deal on the old style of the littermaid mega from amazon . i would just be aware , before buying this , that it only fits the old style of littermaids . that being said , if you 're handy with power tools and woodwork than you might be able to modify it ... it is a simple design .
0	for what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months . i really like foaming soap because i have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap . since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there is n't the big mess to clean . but i have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap . i searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and cuisipro was about all i could find . but within 3 months the pump started to stick and i have to manually move it up and down . it 's cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick .
0	the sheets and comforter in this set are very scratchy and stiff and you can see right through the sheets . i would not recommend the set , very poor quality . i do n't even use the sheets on my son 's bed because they seem so uncomfortable
1	yes , it is made to be a decanter for half bottles , but yes it does easily hold a full bottle . what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner . so , i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses , and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed . if you use it in the same manner , you do not have to worry about the size ( but again , it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact ) . i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table , and guests love it
1	pros : works well . heats fast , auto-shutoff feature and visible water level are nice . cons : putting kettle on base requires lining up 3 slots which takes a little extra care and might result in damage to contacts if you 're not careful .
1	i did n't know which maker i wanted , it was hard making up my mind . i finally chose this one and boy did i make the right choice . it works great , better than i could have hoped for . cookies turned out wonderful and it was fast and easy
0	we got this for our new baby . we loved it until tonight ... it just up and died and i 've only had it 19 days . taking it back tomorrow
1	excellent value towels ! wash first so absorbantcy is best right away . blue color is gorgeous
1	i have not tried to program the timer yet , but as a heater , this is one of the nicest i have had . compact , yet it puts out a nice even heat . it is save in that the unit itself does n't get red hot . the ad says factory reconditioned yet it came in a new box and looks like new . a super deal for auxiliary heating . i use it to warm the livingroom to keep oil consumption down , which it seems to have done so far , without too big an increase in the electric bill
0	we too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned . we already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off , nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem . now a month after using the new one , its espresso pump is loud and noisy , sounding like its broken . also for some reason or another it wo n't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso . it ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out . but then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine . its been going for the last couple of days , but its such a iffy thing . on the plus side it does look nice ! and it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work ! my husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow , but he says that about everything
0	this item arrived with a broken tank , and 1 week later quit making mist at al
0	after a couple months , the humidity became stuck at 20 % . even holding it by my humidifier did n't help
0	we 've had this set for about 3 years and after about a year they began to chip and/or crack . they are beautiful and affordable , but they just do not last . i had two plates crack in half in the microwave . a mug handle break off as i slowly turned it in the dishwasher rack . it 's too bad because i really liked this set
1	this duvet set is soft and easily launderable . looks great and feels even better . fits over my overstuffed down comforter
1	this is my first grill pan and it work very well . i have only cooked chicken on it so far and i have found that i like the way tenders cook better then really thick chicken breasts
1	i have found this item to be very helpful . i only have 1 arm and dust pans are not an option , now when i spill something i can clean it up on my own
1	this is one of the prettiest shades fiestaware has put out . i would like to see them put out a bright shade of pink as well
0	at first , we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner . after one year , however , it started sounding like a jet engine . the turbo-nozzle had broken . i live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things , and when i ordered a new turbo nozzle , they sent a mini . it turns out that the actual replacement nozzle , listed at $ 29.99 a year ago , now costs $ 125.00 ! the explanation i got was `` prices are subject to change without notice . '' now i 'm stuck with a 5-inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me . plus the cord , which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button , creeps in while we 're vacuuming -- and when we press the button too . i love it at first , but i 'll never buy another electrolux . it 's not well made , and they do n't stand behind their product .
1	i bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before christmas , 2006 . it seemed like a perfect - if unnecessary - stocking stuffer for my wife , since we 're both wine enthusiasts . i never really felt these `` gimmick '' aerators did much that a solid 1/2 hour decanting could n't do . boy was i wrong . the device itself is attractive , compact and solidly built . it appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass `` funnel '' with a rubber grip . there are two small channels in the center of the funnel , which look like `` cracks '' in the plastic ( i 've read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable ) . wine is poured through the top of the funnel , and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel . the aerator is easily held , and i 've never had a problem with spills . now on to the `` effect '' of the vinturi . i 've been using the vinturi for 5 months now , on a variety of wines ... from a bottle of `` two buck chuck '' , to a nice '98 vietti barolo , to a bottle of 97 ' phelps insignia . in every circumstance , with every wine , i 've noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the vinturi , as opposed to tasted directly from bottle . the flavours are more blended , the finish is less acidic , and frankly , it has made most of the wines i drink a more pleasurable experience , from sniff to swallow . i 've conducted several `` blind '' tastings with friends , and we all agree - this thing works . if you 're a serious wine drinker - or shopping for a wine drinker in your life - give this product a try . at $ 40 , it 's about the price of a decent california cabernet , and will yield results for decades to come . i plan on picking up a few dozen this christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients
0	this is not a good product -- it is not a very flixible plastic and breaks easily if dropped or flexed . it is also not large enough for some dishes and microwaves . nordicware does make a more flexible cover , but the advertising for this one is not very clear about features
1	not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter , but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home . this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust . it is really useful on those thick pizzas , like spinach and feta . plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board . i almost never use it for any non-pizza cooking , and a heavy , sharp knife works almost as well . however , it 's a fun item , and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza , i definitely recommend it
1	the casserole was exactly what my daughter wanted . it was priced right and came within a few days of odering . i am very pleased with this purchase
0	the only european characteristic of this cup is it 's price . the picture is deceiving - this thing is tiny . i could only put three of my fingers through it 's ear . i am definitely returning it to amazon - in my mind , it 's worth 5 bucks and is more of a for a kid than an adult .
0	do n't buy this fan , unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed . also , if it has green lights ( like my blizzard fan did ) , it will light up a dark room at night . also , you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling . low speed is quiet enough for sleeping , but high will disturb you . the angle tilt adjustments are not precise , and are difficult to do . there are better choices
1	the pillow was in the manuracturer 's box , in brand-new packing and condition , and was delivered right on schedule
0	i bought this machine after researching it for a long time . i could deal with the hard cleaning of it , i was willing to shell out $ 100.00 for a good quality maker , and i loved the design . after two or three uses it started to leak . after much searching i realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short . i paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly . i did n't return it , i just will never buy bodum again
1	my dog is simply crazy about these treats . but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well . since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment . in additon to that , since these treats are all natural , they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats , making them extra healthy . the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you ca n't beat the quality .
0	the top does n't seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering . also , the bottle being so narrow it 's hard to clean .
0	people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product . the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can . i have tried reconnecting it many times , using different pressure as i push down , but to no avail . at 10 dollars a night , this product will get very expensive , very quickly . if it had worked without the leak , i would have given ssscat 5 stars
0	these are not what you 'd expect from wusthof . the wusthof symbol on the handle is a sticker ( ! ! ! ) which bleaches out after washing . also , after 1 months use and washing , we 're getting rust spots . while these knives are sharp , they are not holding up appearance wise . very disappointed
1	we just purchased ours this past week and we love it ! ! we 've had glass coffee makers before and we used to waste so much coffee because it sat on the burner and burnt . now we throw away nothing ! sometimes we wake up the next morning and there is still a half a pot left . a good 1 minute zap in the microwave and it tastes just as good as it did when it was first brewed . this is our second thermal coffee maker and we have found that unless you remove the coffee filter holder after each use and rinse it , it will leak all over . coffee grounds get stuck in the little holes where the coffee comes out and into the thermal pot . also to stop the leak problem , be careful when putting in coffee grounds , make sure none get past it . im a little surprised at the negatives reviews on this product . its an in expensive coffee maker and it does the job very well . the over-flowing of coffee and the leakage problem is due to improper housekeeping . we havent had any problems with this .
0	not a good light . the light is already fading and i do n't use it very often . very disappointed
1	i got this to replace my bulky turner that i got from the dollar store for $ 1.00 . for an extra $ 3 or so i got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me . also , the turner part looks plastic , but i guess it 's silicone or something because it does not melt . also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat . if washing by hand , its easily washable too ! i have both the blue and green , flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen .
0	it looked like such a good idea on tv but that 's the thing about tv . they did n't fit well on my stove at all and i could n't even put my other stock pots on my back burners at the same time . also the bottom scratched after a couple uses !
1	this is a beautiful bookmark for anyone ! shipping was fast and packaging was excellen
1	it 's a wonderful cutting board ( also available at the store ) i 'm a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something i 've found very useful . any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic . this one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks . the $ 9.99 price tag is n't bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well . that , and it just looks great in the kitchen . i use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and would n't go without them . do n't listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a 14 x 17 solid granite cutting board for ten bucks , not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives . fyi to the moron - amp ; quot ; protect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight , tough , polyethylene cutting boards.amp ; quot ; yah , nothing at all ... dimwit
1	my roommate and i use this toaster daily and i 've never had problems with it . the material is light but very sturdy . i actually dropped it down my stairs when i moved and it still looks and works great . i love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions . delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal . i plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but i suspect that wo n't happen for quite a while .
0	this product is not eligible for free shipping , yet it ships from the amazon warehouse along with the humidifier that is eligible for free shipping
0	great coffee , and a convenient size , but the carafes keep breaking on me ! i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke . i ordered a replacement , and was extra careful when handling it ( especially when washing it ) . i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke . these things just seem to spontaneously combust . the carafes are $ 12 a piece , so it 's not worth replacing again . argh
0	i purchased this blanket for $ 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now . the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review . the real issue is that the quality is very poor . i returned it and got a $ 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better . luxuious egyption cotton -- no way .
1	this tea kettle is simply devine to use - no cords in the way - no waiting for water to boil - just let it sit on your kitchen counter and it 's all automatic . looks beautiful , as well . i 've purchased many as gifts and have one at home and one on the boat . thanks cuisinart for this product
0	the item is not packed well for shipping . the drawer and top were cracked . when i called the number on the replacement part , i was told did not have the replacement . they gave me a number to call for target , they in turn told me they could n't send it and told me to call the number i had just called . unreal trying to get this fixed . i am going to have to pack the whole thing up and return myself . no help in getting this taken care of .
0	after i read stories about problems chlorine causes in the shower chlorine i got this filter . it turns out most water systems are using chloramine now , a more stable additive , instead of chlorine and this filter , like most , is ineffective at removing chloramine . see if your water system uses chloramine and save yourself an expensive filter that probably does n't work
1	if you decorate cakes , you need to have a cake stand . i 'm not a professional but enjoy is as a hobby . it 's quite handy
0	i ordered this item but the platter i received has a completely different flower pattern in blue ! i really wanted the item pictured so i 'm not too happy..
1	first one that i have purchased and it is extremely wonderful in the weight content as well as keeping us warm without feeling smothere
1	works great , it is a lot easier than using paper filters
1	i just want to say i am not sure why the person who lost a piece of the product in her ( dawn ulepich `` dawnski337 '' ( illinois ) ) haste is criticizing the company for a bad product . i have only had one problem ever with a rival product and when i called the company , they immediately sent a new product out to take care of the problem even though it was not a product problem but rather a handling problem . i have found that they are a more than fair company and will take care of their customers . they probably would have even taken care of replacement of the plastic part ( even though she lost it ) . it is not fair to penalize the store from which it was bought or the company that produced it because of her carelessness
0	will not last long only a few months old and getting weak alread
0	i purchased this topper june 2006 , and at first loved it . this was a great purchase until it started to shrink , deflate , and discolor . what a waste ! the pad used to be 3 inches think , but it has shrunk significantly in all directions and thickness . it has lost its cushiony quality , and is now uncomfortable . there also appears to be no way to get in touch with the company to inquire about what has gone wrong here .
0	it makes great tea , but the pitchers last about 4 to 6 months before the seam on the front cracks and starts to leak . it would be great if a quality replacement pitcher was available . then i would give it 5 stars
1	this could well be the perfect dog toy , especially if your dog is a queensland heeler with a knack for destroying plastic frisbees , tennis balls , etc . in seconds flat . i 've had one for a couple of weeks now and , aside from some dirt spots , it looks new . it is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not-so-tender mercies of my dog 's attention . this disc is not only very durable , it actually flies really well . as something of a flying-disc connoisseur , i ca n't help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries . plus , it floats . perfect !
0	we had this less than 10 months and used only two of three ultimate filters we purchased separately , that 's how little use this pitcher got . started leaking everywhere one day and i could n't figure out what had happened . i thought i had n't put the innards back in right , after changing the filter , but in the end i decided either a seal or a seam failed . i 'm not the first person to report the leaking problem with minimal use , so i believe it is a design or manufacturing flaw . what a waste of a good $ 60 , with the additional three filters purchased . while it worked , we loved its sleek design , how much water it held and how great the water tasted . that 's why it gets the two stars i gave it . too bad it turned out to be a piece of junk . i see the item is now not available here at amazon and i guess that means someone monitored the returns or complaints about the product and made changes or pulled the item from sales rotation . what i want to know is when we will be notified by pur about the problem , and given coupons or rebates because of it ; if you sent in your warranty card or registered the product online there is no reason pur could n't offer somehting in exchange for their poorly designed item . mine 's now in the trash where it belongs . do n't buy one if you are considering it . go with a good quality , faucet-mounted or under-sink mount filtering system and you will be glad you did , despite the more expensive price
1	i do n't know about the other reviews that say this knives are n't stainless steel , the labels fall off , or the filet knife breaks , but what it 's for sure in my case is that these knifes work great . i do n't go by fanciness nor brandy items ... i want knives that cut nice and easy , and the miracle blade iii are the best . it 's true , if you love your things just follow what says in the instructions manual . do n't dish wash your knives because in addition that they rust , they start to reduce their original sharpness . even more , any knife will reduce their original sharpness no matter what the manufacturer says . do not wash knives in the dishwasher or hand wash them with hot water . all of my knives preserve their labels and looks like new , and i use them on a daily basis . once again , it 's a matter of following instructions . my filet knife is in perfect condition . common sense : do n't do everything what the infomercial shows . do n't bend the filet knife to verify that the guy on the infomercial 's testimony is right . this knife cuts beautifully without too much bending . finally , i own this set of knives for two years and a half and they still cut as good as the first day i received them by mail . i live in colombia , south america , where this product is not too cheap , so i had to think several times before i decided to make the call . today , after two years and a half i do n't regret of making that call , and i am very happy cooking with my miracle blade iii knife set . furthermore , i do recommend this knife set to anyone ... . just follow instructions , that 's all
0	the product description for this is wrong ! ! there is a somewhat `` hidden '' zipper but for some inexplicable reason , the lining is sewn into the cover so you ca n't separate the two .
0	i purchased this toy for a friend 's dog a while back . the dog loved it , he played with it non-stop ( quack ! quack ! ) . when he finally destroyed it though we were shocked . inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag . my friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items . we did complain to the manufacturer who said they 'd look into it , but i would still be wary of this toy . i think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it 's toys , but does n't rip them to shreds ! there is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe !
0	i heard about the lids and hoped that they would be a good alternative to plastic wrap . i even bought two for gfts . but they did n't live up to my expectations . the large size did n't even fit on standard size bowls and the small one did n't fit on small bowls . i would return them except that i threw out the original packaging . i do n't recommend this product
0	my pump just up and quit after several years ... and it did n't always work great , but when it did , it was ideal . so i 'll replace it , but with some other product , not the cuisipro again .
0	i can put up with the weight , the noise , the poorly located on-off switch , the spinning brush that is cool but does n't work . what i can not put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on . it will appear to be on correctly , but if not , the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction . this creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister . buy something else , i ca n't wait for this one to die
0	as others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years , and no replacement parts to fix , so the can opener has to trashed
1	we have finished our basement and have a home theater room which is on the cool side . we bought this heater to warm up the room and it works great
0	this bread box had to be `` fixed '' by the time i received it . it was a minor thing , and works well , however i would not have bothered buying the box had i known that there would be problems with it
0	the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know that i would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop . when using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where i stop , therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels . when using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks ! i have not recommended this product to anyone . a waste of $ 100.00
0	it works fine , but my cat wo n't use it . i was thrilled with the reviews i read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived . unfortunately , i like it better than my cat does . he largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass . oh well . before you buy , make sure it 's not the sound of the water that attracts your cat . this fountain has no water sound ( pretty quite , actually ) . i think that 's why my cat ignores it
1	i 've searched all over for a doubler that was less than 32 '' and this works great ! i have short closet bars so most doublers caused my lower bar clothes to drag on the floor . this product lets me pick the length i need . it 's metal materials makes it quite durable too . hooray
0	i rate this set very poor . in less than six months the face cloth has holes in it . the towel absorption is ok
1	this is the most amazing knife i have ever owned ! i ve purchased henckles twinstars , sabatier ; which is pure junk ! out of all the knives ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives . i enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives . i have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all global this is quite a bold move as i consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where i must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know i do not want to live without . i simply can not quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and henckles twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a pandora 's box of spending . it actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other . i must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the `` excaliber of knives .
0	i am usually very happy with hilfiger home products . well , these towels are run of the mill discount linen store quality . there is nothing luxurious about them whatsoever . i would expect to pay around 10 bucks for each . they are not worth it ... i do n't know what the heck kind of towels some of the other reviewers were using before they bought these ! !
1	this is a handy , sturdy and attractive bottle opener you can use to either flip open pop-top caps or pierce the top of cans . its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand , making it require less force to operate than the more traditional bottle openers do , keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries , and rendering it perfect for broth cans , soda bottles , cans of baby formula , etc . like the rest of the products from the oxo good grips line , this one is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability and flawless performance . its ergonomic design and big , pressure-absorbing , outstanding non-slip grip , complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging , allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use . its elegant , stylized , standard oxo shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your oxo utensils in the kitchen or in the bar . its easy-to-clean , simple construction and dishwasher-safe , hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years , and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away . after submitting this product to over two years of normal use , mine is still just like new . -- reviewed by maritza volma
1	i love this little coffee maker . i have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but i have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum . this maker is made from stainless steel , which is more expensive , but for me it 's worth it ( as it will probably last a lifetime . ) it makes a very good cup of coffee and i 'm very happy with it . also , the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent
1	i had high hopes for these 600-thread count sheets and they 've exceeded every one of them . they perfectly fit my oversize king . after 5 washes now they are as soft as ever . sleeping on these sheets is simply wonderful
1	i bought a few of these collars out of desperation . in the past , my cats got out of any kind of safety collar within an hour of putting them on . since i was moving recently , i was especially afraid of the cats getting lost during the move or at our new home . i bought these collars because of the reviews , and everything that the other reviewers say is true . the only thing i 'll add is that one of my cats managed to chew through his collar over the course of several months , but it 's still the only kind i 'll use for him . at this price , i can easily afford replacements
1	like the other reviewers , it would be nice if the plastic was metal ... but i love this little thing ! i usually have tons of honey everywhere . just put a little hot water in the base , let sit for a few minutes and it pours out great ! so easy that even my little kids can use it without making too much mess
1	i see a lot of people have leaky shakers . not me . mine is absolutely perfect . the top/strainer piece fits snugly , leak-free , requiring just the right amount of effort to de-couple it from the canister . the design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister . the lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top . the cap/jigger also fits perfectly , with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily
0	being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me . i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight . if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons . firstly , there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries . this light is also extremely fragile . over a couple of years i went through 7 of these ! i would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply , and the constant new purchases after it breaks , you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light . i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises ( available at barnes nobel - come on and get it in stock amazon ! ) it is terrific ! it has a clock with an alarm and a timer . you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes . at that time you can extend the minutes . if you do n't do so , for example you 're sleeping , it will automatically shut off . it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light
1	i have two kittens which are spoiled rotten and have more toys than they can ever wish for . this is by far one of their favorites . they love the moving ball and use the center scratch area often ( keeps them off the furniture and other areas . ) i know they play with it daily . very reasonably priced and definitely a must for cats ! !
0	the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor . it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter . but , it must not have been very big . i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case . these were brand new batteries . there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them . this is bad . modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries . i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter , but traveling i would use the batteries . do n't make this mistake
1	i have some nice nonstick cookware that i needed whisks for , so i got these . my main reasons for choosing them were the brand , and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone , rather than silicone coated steel . unfortunately that is not the case . this is silicone coating metal . this is acceptable though , because the 5-year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off , and 5 years of cookware-safe whisking for this price is worth it to me ! the whisk is wonderful , and i 'd recommend it to anyone . just do n't believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above
0	i 've owned this sofa for less than a year and it completely fell apart . the seat of the sofa is supported by a wooden frame with a nylon webbing stretched taught and stapled over it . we had 4 people of reasonable weight on the sofa ( something we 've done numerous times before ) and it collapsed out from underneath us . the four parts of the seat frame are held in with small little dowels that rest on a less than one inch lip around the outside of the couch frame . the sofa is designed to look nice but does not hold up well to average use . for $ 400 a sofa should last at least a year of moderate use of people only sitting on it ! ! ! you 're better off going to ikea or some other retailer that spends as much time in the basic structural design as they do in the appearance of the couch .
1	i am a sous chef and i use this knife to break down everything from shell steak to veal chops , and i love it . i also like the flexibility of the blade . it holds an edge very well , with minimum touch ups . overall i am very happy with the wusthof line . edit 4/6/05 : still using it , still like new , almost 3 years of almost daily use later . ca n't beat wusthof
1	the step stool , a gift for my daughter , works well as a step stool . the problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool . the frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws . there was a hole in the box and the screws fell out , so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together
1	these sheet are nice and soft have them around 3 months now and ca n't wait until it 's their turn to be put on my bed
1	i 've had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably . it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued , wusthof , global and henckels , knives organized , out of sight , protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger 'made mostly for show ' blocks would . if you 're looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time . if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger . that 's just my opinion . i could be wrong
0	the space between the strands is much greater than shown in the picture . the cutrain will not hide what is behind it
0	i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up `` big people food '' for my grandson . it could not even grind up a soft hot dog ! we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material ( painted gray to look like metal ! ) it just could n't do the job . sheesh , i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder . total waste of money . also , my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two . junk
0	just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back . even on maximum setting , it hardly toasts . we tried different breads , different settings and it just does n't work right . we even tried toasting ( on maximum ) one lot of bread ( not good ) and followed it by another lot of bread ( better , but not adequate ) on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread . forget it . on the up side , the toaster looks good . but for $ 80 it should toast better than my old $ 9.99 black and decker ! !
1	this stainless steel stock pot is just right for those of us who ca n't fit our favorite soup recipes into a dutch oven . cleaning it is a breeze , and it is still small enough to fit on a convenient cabinet shelf . that says it all
1	this is a great product , it comes with clips for a shoulder strap , but no strap . that is the only thing left wanting
0	the stool is great as far as it 's ability to function . it is quite thin which makes it easy to store . it does have a safety issue ! ! ! ! ! my 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together . i almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion . my husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus , no more pinched fingers . i would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around . i was right there when my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger
1	i got this oven as a replacement for an older delonghi model we 've been using for years in the office kitchen . my staff loves it . i ca n't wait until they make me some cookies ! :
1	hunter fan arrived in 2 days from amazon.com and immediately i noticed the weight of the fan ... heavy , just the way i like it . unpacked this beauty and plugged her in and off she went with a beautiful sound . i love the 3 wing blade and the speed variation is great ... from barely running to blow your hat off ... ... we love it , keep up the good work hunter . i intend to buy one for a christmas gift also .
0	just got the pressure cooker , and it looks like a great , heavy duty pot . very nice . because of the other reviews , my main purpose in purchasing this was for canning . however , after reading the manual , i learned that this can not be used at altitudes above 3,000 feet -- which leaves out a lot of colorado , new mexico , utah ... ... otherwise , i 'm sure it 's great
1	this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen . it 's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons . you 'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control , and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily . the blade keeps its edge for a long time , but eventually you will have to sharpen it . i invested in a good coarse stone , a good 1000 grit water stone , and the $ 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant . good stones are expensive though . i think it 's worth it for such a fine knife
1	very quick and good coffee as long as you buy the proprietary pods , which can be found on line usually with free shipping
1	i was lucky to get the stainless popper on clearance . it is wonderful . we have used it for several months now . it is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn . i am so disappointed that target is not carrying the stainless model anymore . my college children who do n't live at home want their own , even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan . i 'm sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models . when i bought mine , i chose stainless because i knew it could handle the high heat well - and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher . hey , target , how about carrying the stainless model again ?
1	the cookies were amazing . i really liked using these cutters . they came 5 days earlier which was perfect since i was doing them for bridal shower favors . the only problem i had was that i ordered two of the same size , and when they came in the mail , one was smaller . i had two different size cookies
0	one should n't have to empty water out after every use . one should n't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice . that is not a functional teapot , if that may be the case . though it is the prettiest teapot around , it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while . le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime , but the enamelware ca n't even touch the quality of the cast-iron cookware . fortunately , the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement . see www.lecreuset.com for details..
0	the wire broke off as i was slicing my first slice of chedder cheese . needless to say , i do not recommend this cheese slicer . last i checked , they 're supposed to last longer than one slice . maybe mine was faulty ... but regardless , i expect better
0	i dont see the point in this , the mighty bright led light lasts a lifetime because it uses l.e.d . therefore you will not need replacement . besides that the product photo of this `` replacement bulbs '' show ordinary light bulps , not led ! !
1	i just received this set yesterday and have n't had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet ( i 'll try to remember to update this review once i do ) , but there were a few initial impressions i thought merited a review on their own : - the cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package . instead , the kit contained a small fold-out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook . ( i doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook , or even that it sways many would-be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit . but its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase , and is something you should know before you buy . ) - that having been said , the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good , i have no doubt whatsoever that they 'll be wonderful , functional additions to my kitchen . the hard-anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability . i 'm impressed . and i 'll be back to say more once i actually use them to make pizzas !
1	t-fal is an excellent quality and a good buy . nice , heavy pan and very `` non-stick '' . now i just have to find a lid to fit it 's large size !
0	i was really excited to try this cage out for my 6 lb male maltese . it is a perfect size and it seemed really well made . my dog does n't really like cages and was able to chew right through the zipper seam . he is not aggressive and does not chew things he should n't , so to my surprise about a week after my husband and i bought the cage , we found him out of it . we were truly disappointed . it is a cute cage and has a very sturdy frame . if you are not planning on zippering the cage or your dog does not chew through zippered seams , it is a great cage ... ..but overall , i was disappointe
1	my pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind . he jumps to pull the beas out of the hive . he squeaks the beas . perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head . he went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it . it is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads . he likes the wing detail for chewing on . this toy gives exercise . i am so glad i tried it . he plays with the hegehog on his own . those are the 2 best toys . the squirels from the hide a squirel are fun , but the game holder is not something he was really excited about . these interactive toys are great . i have never seen such excitement and tail wagging . he hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise . this one is the best . it is well worth $ 10 for a dog who loves to play . i get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys
0	i received this item - in the description is stated is was 17 inches long when in reallity it was 22 - unable to use still sitting in the box unused - tried to contact the 800 # given by the rep to return - to date no luc
1	i had a small version of salad shooter , it was great , used it for so many years , but now the blade was dull , and i kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them . i decided the next salad shooter i buy should be slightly larger . so i bought this salad shooter professional series , which is great , having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day : multiple cones to change , large feeding place for the veggy , fast , light , eassy to clean including in the dishwasher , still small enough to store in small spaces , efortless to cut and shread your veggy , no need for knife and cutting board . what i like the most about this product is the fact that when i put veggy in it to be cut , shread ... , the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut , so i do not have to push it in , probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades . this way your work is done in no time . in my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen .
0	my wife got this cuisinart classic toaster oven as a wedding gift . we liked the appearance and had it on our registry . we used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well . toast was perfect , and the oven cooked nice and hot . we broiled meats and made all kind of things in it . we found it hard to clean . we would take the baking pan/and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those , but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven . then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter . i glued it back on with super glue . it broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so i had to fix this plastic foot a few times . then another problem arose . the toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start . so to make toast we just used the un-timed bake function , but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast . still we lived with it . then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working . so it does not bake . i think i knew this was going to happen because i would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever i turned the dial to bake for a while . so therefore i think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last . i would have expected better quality . considering how long we have been making toaster ovens , i think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls . so like other reviews say , it does cook well and evenly , but it is hard to clean and does not last . if i were to have rated the product before the problems started i would have given it 4 stars . i wish that amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality , because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products . we are now looking into t-fall convection toaster oven , but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts . ______________ since writing my review above i tried to fix my oven to no avail , but i have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke . my recommendations are as follows . since i know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this `` classic '' model product can over time get dirty and stop working , i recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops , rice cookers , deep fryers , pressure cookers , or kitchen sinks . especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease . i recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls , which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location . this might make the unit last longer . the newer cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem i had . or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways . maybe 1.5 years is average life , or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction . reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products . from the reviews and my observations above , i think the krups models and the improved cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me .
0	light is beautiful and functional , and so great for traveling , but first led light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months . too bad .
0	got it to work once but ca n't now dont buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	why oh why did i buy this useless thing ? i have a perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen , which does what it is supposed to do , namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners , walls , and floor . is it perfect ? no . but it definitely does most of the job , which is what i ca n't say about the tovolo . it has three fatal flaws . first , the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off . i had to use one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid -- hot hot hot -- as i tried to wedge the handle under the screen 's lip with my other hand . second , count the number of air holes in the silicone screen . then , count the holes in the metal mesh of the cuisipro , or its ilk . the purpose of a screen is to catch the grease , and this is the important part , to allow the steam to escape , otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food . i first tried using the tovolo to saute ground beef . the beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen . third , too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat . in all fairness , the mesh type bows also , but not as much , possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable . this product , imo , is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version . save your money and buy the old fashioned kind .
0	i was pleased with the way the hoover cleaned my floors , except that i had to empty the containers too many times . after using it for 3 or 4 weeks , i realized that it is scratching and scuffing the floors and they look terrible . i hope i can return it because i can no longer use it . terry sit
1	i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it . it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved . i definitely recommend it . i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special .
0	i have owned this unit for 2 years . the water seems ok and definitely better than from the tap . however , every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back . the replacement cartridges are very expensive . there is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter , and this knob recently has broken off . we can not seem to access the company 's website to get a replacement part . i am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether . i would not buy again . ( also , i have had lots of problems with their water bottles ... leakage , breaking , etc . i wo n't buy any product from this company again .
1	i 've been using spiegelau wine glasses for several years , and they are excellent . the bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine . these glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine . ( they 're also not bad for rhones , though i prefer the reidel vinum syrah glass . ) if you drink a lot of burgundy , or pinot noir , or italian piedmont wines ( barolo , barbaresco , langhe ) , i 'd suggest spiegelau 's burgundy glass . if your preference is zinfandel or chianti , you 're a bit out of luck with spiegelau however . their chianti glass is n't very good . try the riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines ; you 'll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet . some reviewers have complained about breakage . i 've seldom broken a glass , but it does occasionally happen during washing . my method is to clear the sink , run the water as hot as possible , put a bit of dishsoap in each glass . i then use a special ultra soft brush ( which i got at a local wine shop for about $ 6 ) to clean the glass , removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim . then rinse thoroughly with very hot water . invert on cloth . after about half an hour , with the glasses almost dry , you can wipe them off with paper towels ( which do n't leave any lint behind ) and put them away . the main thing is never to lay them down in the sink , and wash one glass at a time . just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you 're doing . do n't try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying ; just use the paper towels . finally , even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe , i do n't know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher . dishwashers always leave a film , and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses , which lose their clarity as a consequence
0	a friend of ours bought this for us . he owns several coffee shops and we were excited to have great coffee at home . out of the box , i needed to tinker with it for a while and had to refer to online chat rooms to figure out how to get it to work correctly . the problem was that the coffee did n't stay perculating long enough in the top and then it shot down into the carafe . i called bodum of north america and their customer service person was a surley $ $ *** ! ! ! ! ! ! ***** . they offered no help at all and had no idea what i was talking about which unless they totally disregard internet reviews was a lie . several people wrote , in online articles , to cut down the tube that goes in to the carafe by small dimension . i did n't do that but i learned that if you do n't push the top down all the way it will work okay . after i got it working okay , it did make really good , and hot coffee . then the poorly designed flip top broke and bodum has never had it back in stock ( i wonder why ! ) , then we got really sick of trying ( in vane ) to clean the inside of the carafe . finally the annoyance of the thing as a whole overrode the quality of the coffee . my advice is if you want really great coffee go to your local cafe . for day to day coffee at home do n't buy this . it looks cool and does make good coffee but at a big price
1	after several tries and telephone calls to my brother ; i finally have the blade in the correct position ( i had problems with the directions in the book ) . it works great now . a reminder to oil the blades before you put the machine away ; they rust easily if damp
0	i liked the price and all the different stitches . however , i needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things , such as alterations and heavy sewing . i 'm very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine . the needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread . also , the food feed stalls , jerks and surges . this machine has beautiful stitches , but is for lightweight sewing only
0	i purchased a krups thermal replacement pot for an electric coffee maker . about two weeks after i bought it , i made coffee one morning only to discover the coffee running all over the floor . for no apparent reason , the glass inside of the thermal pot had completely shattered . i will be returning the pot this week
0	cat kept peeing on laundry . tried this product , no change . the only thing that worked was constant cleaning/changing of litter . maybe this works for other cats , but not mine
1	this timer is great . light enough to wear around when you do your 15 minutes of cleaning and flying ! keeps excellent time . magnet is good to put on fridge , or on any metal cupboard . i love it ! best for the $ $
1	the pot rack was just the right size and color . it looks great in my kitchen without creating a barrier between my kitchen and dining room . i love how easy it was to hang and the number of links provided with it mean that it can hang really low if i want . this is just perfect for my kitchen
1	i destroy cooking pots . i 'm especially lethal to the light-weight teflon lined variety you 'll find at the supermarket . my secret is simple : i like to cook on high heat and i get easily distracted . that guarantees that i 'll forget what 's on the stove and produce a scorched ( and warped ) utensil . if a lightweight teflon pot lasts me two years , it 's extraordinarily lucky . i now own four ( different ) swiss diamond pots . and even my brutal habits leave them unimpressed . despite regular disasters , they seem to shrug off what would vanquish a lesser pot . ( admittedly , i do avoid metal spoons and spatulas and clean them with non-abrasive means . ) they have excellent non-stick characteristics , superb heat-spreading , and -- love it -- are approved for very hot oven use . adding up to essential cooking tools ! and when you factor the price of regularly replacing `` cheaper '' pots , their cost becomes more than bearable . highly recommended
0	i ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic . however , this kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water . i boiled it a few times plus tried the water/vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help . i decided that i did n't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so i 'm returning it - it 's not worth the risk . i ca n't figure out if it 's coming from the `` stainless steel '' bulb ( that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it ) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass the bulb . plus the lid has a stong odor too that is plastic covered in `` stainless steel ''
0	i purchased this product in november 2003 and still have not had it installed . the customer service is horrible . i had questions and had a very difficult time finding a service company who knew anything about this haier machine . i called customer service over five times and had to have corporate refer me to a company in indiana . nobody i knew has had a combo , and it has been frustrating dealing with the company . i also did not know i could not return this product . i honestly regret getting this machine ; it is pricey and not worth it . i was looking forward to the space saving option , but i rather have no machine than face the hassles and headaches . i read a few negative reviews and do not look forward to the troubles ahead .
1	this pan is a good buy and a wonderful size for 2-3 member families . although not as heavy as some of the french copper pans , i have many of the commercial calphalon pieces and love the handle . the pan is definately heavier than cheap quality pans and the stainless interior is just what i wanted for acidic based cooking ( tomato sauces , etc ) . as far as scratches , well , what do you expect ? if you use it , it is going to get some scratches ... the brushed exterior helps hide some of the outside marks though . some have complained about scratches on the other calphalon hard anodized , but most of the time , they really are n't scratches , but rather aluminum marks from the rivets when stacking . in any case , they are easily removed with scotchbrite and some cleaner ! enjoy ! p.s . i chose the no shipping cost delivery and received the pan in just 4 days !
0	never got it to work . all i get when i hit the on/tare button is `` - - - - '' in the trash it goes
1	this jewelry organizer is very handy and takes up no room in my closet . it makes it so easy to accessorize in the mornings . i 'm really glad i bought it - no more misplaced earrings
0	i bought this kettle in february 2006 . i liked everything about it until its automatic on-off switch died recently - only two months after the purchase . now the kettle wo n't turn on . it was n't abused in any way , and these kettles usually last for years and years . the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 . i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique ? has anyone else had one with a short-lived switch , or was i unlucky ?
1	gave this salt crock as a gift and it met all of my expectations . it was a nice size for the kitchen unlike some of the larger ones . overall i am satified with this purchase
1	we tried littermaid and still use it in our motor home , but we absolutly love the cat genie for our 2 spoiled and large cats . we would not only buy it again , we 're getting one for my sister for her birthday , and recomending it to everyone we know with cats . we 've been using it for the past 5 months and it has clogged twice . [ an easy clean-up and fix ] much less hassle than the litter maid and no smell or dealing with overflowing cartridges . [ or my dh 's attempts to 'modify ' the littermaid so it will hold more , or use bags or boxes , etc ... which never work and make a smelly mess ! ! ] every now and then the 'soap box ' will jiggle loose and might need a tap to re-seat it , but you get a beep to warn you . now if they would only make a smaller cat genie for the rv
1	the last 2 pitcher 's i had lasted @ 3 years.. what more can you say :
1	great honing steel that is a bit longer than others i looked at ( seems to help a bit for the bigger knives ) and an attractive taper ( not sure that matters , but it looks nice ) . i 've only had it a brief time , though i 've used it frequently . despite an occasional clumsy collision , this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks . it straightens the edge on my ( mostly ) mid-grade knives with ease . another reviewer claimed the handle was plastic . perhaps he was mistaken , or perhaps he had a different version . but mine , purchased later , has a visible grain if you look close , under a dark ebony finish . it does almost `` feel '' plastic due to the hard resin finish , but it is the same material as on the shun knives a friend has ( though the steel lacks the metal endcap that her knives have ) . aesthetics are open to debate , but i think it looks much nicer than most , and performs better than any other i 've used for daily straightening . for less frequent light sharpening , i recommend a diamond steel . global makes the best diamond steel i 've seen , but i 've stuck with the dmt for a quarter the price
0	my friend was ecstatic when she opened up this present from me at the holidays . she claims it 's the best spice rack - very durable , stylish , and does n't take up too much space on the kitchen counter . to prove her point , she went and bought fresh spices and made her own personalized spice rack . definitely was a hit
0	i liked the product until it showed a small split in the bottom and developed a slow leak after only a few uses . perhaps the plastic does n't tolerate boiling water as well as it should
0	i purchased this blender several months ago and the power of the motor is great . but if you make smoothies and crush a lot of ice , the plastic carafe will absolutely not hold up to that use . mine now leaks all over the base unit even though i 've always washed it by hand and followed the manual 's instructions . the waring website says this product is sold with a glass carafe , but they do n't sell the glass carafe as a replacement part - only the plastic . if you think you 're going to crush ice or use the power of the motor , you 're going to have big problems with the plastic carafe . ( and the replacement plastic carafe is $ 50 ! ! ) at this point , i think i 'm going to have to throw out the blender
0	clock is smaller than i thought , and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall . made of cheap materials , definitely not worth $ 25
0	when i first put this on i thought hey i ca n't smell it anymore . well that illusion only lasted a day and the odor came back . i repeated it , letting it dry in between as directed , until the bottle was empty and it still smells . this just wasted my time
1	it does exactly what it says . state of the art cutlery , cutting vegetables becomes a pleasure . it is stunning the precision of this knife ; you set it on the food push it and goes down the exact direction intended . it did not go 1/1000 of an inch to left or to the right . i used it for onion , and let me tell you ; never in my life was so easy , at the end the onion was so small chopped . it felt like i was cutting air . i even bought a kitchen electric chopper precisely to use it for cutting onions . i do not need it anymore . the design it is so sleek and elegant ! i felt in love with it only by seeing it on the picture , after a research on the internet i bought it and i am not sorry . i got tired to try and replace knives . definitely , i will buy the shun set . i highly recommended , like no other product !
0	product was fine except that it is n't microwaveable . at the time of purchase it claimed to be microwaveable . the handle has a screw in it . i purchased it specifically for use in a microwave
0	i opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around . i promptly called amazon and they replaced it . it was a waste of money , the first time i washed them , white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out . i was very , very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again . do n't waste your money
0	i loved this blender while it was working . i mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit . i love that it has seamless buttons so food ca n't get caught in little cracks . i rarely used the food processor . after about 11 months , mine also started to smell like it was catching fire - however , it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar , which was basically being `` shaved '' by the base motor . i had to order a replacement `` blender cutting assembly '' from the cuisinart website for $ 15 with shipping , only to have it happen again . plus , it was a pain to clean - the base threading did n't match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult . we 've replaced the blender with another brand but i have kept the bottom motor part for the processor
0	this is a nice quality lightweight comforter . there is a discrepancy right up front in the 'product details ' that lists it as shipping weight '9.00 lbs . ' which is not the case at all . after arrival of two of them , we were shocked . when advised seller they replied after many days , said we needed to read the 'product description ' ( scroll further down on item ) which was different info from what was listed above . they did not update information on this item for customers on amazon site for 2 months.. thus the 2 stars . i should have written this review earlier . on the plus side , it is very nice quality , individual pocket stitching to keep fill in place and border piping , ideal for springtime .
1	i was looking for an offset serrated knife as mentioned by bourdain , and this fits the bill . outstanding veggie slicer and all-around food prep instrument . even over-ripe tomatoes , the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding , are no match for it . besides the small and handy size , the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles . when it finally begins to dull , several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights
1	we love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff - we love nothing more than our cast iron and lodge makes great ones at decent prices .
1	i have twin boys and for their 3rd birthday their room was being done in all thomas the tank . these sheets were a real thrill for them . i only wish they would come in a higher thread count or softer fabric . the boys do n't seem to care , however
1	i have these on my bed right now-they are wonderful . i am not quite sure what the complaints are about . i got these in a gold color and they are wonderful ... yes , they get wrinkled . but i put them on my bed when they are still hot out of the dryer and spray then with a wrinkle releaser when i put them on the matress . i love them . i have a 20 '' wide matress and they fit so nicely ! for the thread count-the price is right ! i am sure that you will enjoy these as much as i do
0	this toaster is more a decoration than anything else . my kids eat a lot of bagels frozen waffles , and this machine just does n't do the job without multiple toasting cycles . even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle . i also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place , break off . ( how ? ? it just sits on the counter , no one is playing football with it ! ) i feel that i wasted $ 50.00 on this- save your money
0	the piece seemed a little wobbly in the beginning . however , as time passed it seemed to be straining under its the weight of the 5 lamps . now after 5 months , it just gave way , and the stand came apart . extremely disappointed with the product
1	works great , can use easily and waffles taste great ! my kids could live on waffles if i would let them , and this is an asset to have in any kitchen- makes extra light and fluffy waffles
1	this far exceeds any similar bowl . so what if the other reviewer has to flip this thing 3 times to get his/her heep of sugar . personally , i replaced my sugar bowl/spoon server so that my children would not over do it on the sugar in their morning cereal . the product feels and looks great and functions well . i ended up buying another one for my work location . it is super easy to clean and the fact that it is of simple design makes after use clean up a snap .
0	i searched for what i thought would be a great dish rack . this is without a doubt the worst product i have ever bought ! there is nothing stainless about this ! i have had it for only about 4 months and it is already rusting . it was so not worth the money i paid for it . i would not recommend buying this product
0	unlike many people it seems , i 've never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker -- it 's still sturdy for me after about 8 uses . however , the fact that i 've owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself . this waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles . i 've never been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles i 've had in restaurants . after trying over half a dozen different recipes , i realized that it was n't my ingredients -- it was the waffle maker . this waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be -- crispy on the outside , chewy and moist on the outside . instead , no matter what recipe i used , or how long i cooked the waffles for , i would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness ( if they had any to begin with ! ) within moments of leaving the waffle maker . the model does n't burn the waffles , the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking , and overall the waffle maker is nice looking . but that 's all it has going for it . i 've learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances , you get what you pay for .
0	my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins . the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out ; the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine . then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors . i had the same problem as other reviewers , the water tank kept leaking . so off to the returns department we went . i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked ? not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it .
1	the pots and pans were delivered very quickly to my residence . the items were well packaged . since we just moved into our apartment , we began using them . the pots and pans had sturdy construction and was relatively easy to clean . the only drawback would be the lid handles . those became very hot to the touch , and you would need a hand towel or an oven mitt to handle it . ( on a side note , the lid handles are clear glass , so that is definitely a plus ! ) overall , i am quite satisfied with the purchase . they were under $ 100.00 for the set , so we are happy with it . although i did not hear of the pinzon brand before , i was surprised with the quality . i even purchased a oven roaster w/rack from pinzon as well
1	what an awesome product ! heavy-duty and sturdy , you 'd never know it was an `` assemble-at-home '' item . it 's a quality piece of furniture . it 's on wheels , which is a good thing because it is surprisingly heavy . let 's start at the top : the butcher block top . it 's three inches thick and , as such , it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart . it is made of fine , high-quality asian hardwoods . the finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil . the next is the cart itself . immediately under the butcher block top , there is a 2 '' deep drawer . it 's large and deep enough to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice . the pull handle on the drawer is fashioned out of brushed chrome . beneath the drawer , there is a shelf . surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods , adding a modern look . matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart , perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders . below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors . the pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish . the cabinet is large enough to hold an entire set of dinnerware ( as in my case where i have eight place settings that include dinner and luncheon plates , fruit and soup bowls , and more ) . finally , heavy-duty , professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing . the two in the front are locking . to prevent stubbed toes , the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit . the easy to follow directions for assembly ( which are diagrammed and in english ) call only for a philips screwdriver . a hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts . i used an electric screwdriver for both the philips screws ( 14 in all ) and the hex bolts ( after i found the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver ) . i can happily report that all pieces fit together easily ( no struggling to match up this piece with that piece ) and all holes are pre-drilled . the drawer requires assembly also . the runners for the drawer are already attached ! you must put together the front , sides and back of the drawer with screws ( again , all holes are pre-drilled ) . a word of advice regarding assembling the drawer : follow the directions where it says to put the screws in only halfway before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer . i made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble sliding the bottom into the assembled front , back and sides . it 's a snug fit . once i loosened the screws enough , the bottom easily popped into place and i was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws . i have only one other thing to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart : once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright , you must lift the butcher block and set it down on the top of the cart . at this point , you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart and they 're pointing upward . these screws will fit into four pre-drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block . you must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart . because the butcher block is so heavy , you may want to have help . but what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture it ended up being . ikea sells a similar item for twice the money . i give the home styles double door kitchen cart with butcher block top 5 stars because of the beauty of the product and its better-than-a-bargain price
1	i actually purchased this book light so that i can read while i wait for my child to sleep . he likes me to be in the room . this was perfect . does not put out enough light to bother my son , but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while i wait for him to fall asleep
1	it is just like having a diaper genie for babies , makes it much cleaner
0	i 've had a lot of problems using this , my sister has one and loves it ! but for me , it leaks
0	i expected better durability out of this fan . it died after just 3 months , and had flow problems from day one . i tried contacting lasko but got no responses .
0	the feel of the sheet is good , but the details , such as the elastic are questionable . elastic on fitted sheet is loose and slips off easily
0	this `` tea cattle '' is absolutely adorable . it is not practical for daily use . the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove . the lid does n't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move .
1	looking for a great armless chair ? you just found it . this is an affordable chair , a comfortable chair , and a chair that is easy to assemble . trust me on this one . unless you are going to spend 80 dollars or more , you are not going to find a better chair . see ya next review .
1	i bought one of these for my apartment , and it 's quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills . it does contain the odor better than a garbage can , but does not completely eliminate it . the instructions seem a bit confusing at first , but it 's a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show . with that in mind , it 's a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor ( particularly for indoor environments ) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty 's respiratory system
0	i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it . the metal is thin and flimsy , and the construction very poor ( e.g. , little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose ) . also , it was a bit lopsided , so it did not sit squarely on my counter . maybe it works fine . who knows . the design and manufacture were so poor , i did n't keep it long enough to find out
1	none of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff ! i bought this and the 8 '' fry pan 2 months ago and , except for the bottoms , still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day . i even used a bacon press ( cast iron ) in it every time i cooked bacon and a couple of times i accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left . hubby stacked knives and forks inside , then topped it off with 6 dinner plates . i thought it was done for -- scratches and nicks everywhere , but no , not a single mark . my calphalon commercial nonstick ( which hit the trash already ) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr. old did that . i must admit , though , that i do not use metal utensils in it , nor do i put in a dishwasher since i wo n't have one til the kitchen is remodeled . overall , though , just from what abuse it has gotten , i 'm very impressed and will buy more . my advice ? do n't mess with the rest -- buy the best and this is it . going to try the wok next . wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it
0	i have ordered this unit twice this past month , the first one did not work properly in one of the units , the signal was distorted . after returning it to the supplier , i ordered it again from another amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all . i will now look for another brand
1	i bought this product for our family to start making pizzelles . its so easy to make and the size is just perfect . i would recommend this product to everyone . kids can do this too
0	do n't buy this product . it was ill-fitting and incompatible with the coffee maker amazon matched it up with . i returned mine and went with paper filters , which work so much better and are cleaner
0	i was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night . it sounded great and much cheaper then the henckels of the world . and look at all the different types of knives . not worth it . these knives do n't cut well at all ( as compared to my henckel knife ) . i wish i did n't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives . also , the block holder is huge ! it takes up too much space .
1	i just love my new multi tasking opener . i have arthritis and it was difficult to open jars and this has been a life saver
0	toaster was defective . had to send it back . cost me $ 20 in shipping and i have nothing to show for it
1	i ordered this item because i know wusthof has a reputation for quality . i find the kitchen shears sturdy and sharp ; especially appreciated are the easy-separation feature of the blades for washing and the handy lid-gripper for opening jars and bottles
1	finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction ! i have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived . the suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned . the hepa filter means you really ca n't smell that you 've been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change . also , who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner ? hey , if you have to own one , would n't you prefer to have one that 's easy on the eye ?
0	while one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles , i could n't get it to work at all . i tried it on two different shapes of bottles , but to no avail . the problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper does n't slide when it 's on the bottle . when off the bottle , the mechanism works fine . it appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general . at least that was my experience . i found a good $ 3.00 stopper at sur la table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle . it does n't have the fancy pour spout , but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne
1	this tablecloth is exactly what i was looking for . it is a good quality material and the shipping was very fast
1	i recommend this product . it is excellent quality . very quiet when running and has lots of power
0	i opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around . i promptly called amazon and they replaced it . it was a waste of money , the first time i washed them , white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out . i was very , very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again . do n't waste your money
0	the metal side arms that the drawer slides down on were binding and need some lubrication . somewhat flimsy . i do not expect it to last long . nice concept , but i wish they had used better materials
1	i received great customer service and a beautiful plant here . i would recommend this gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift . my gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition , is still very healthy , and smells terrific . i 've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said `` what smells so good grandma ?
0	this item is cheaply made and i sent it back . the picture looks cool but it 's deceiving . the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side , it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left , it plopped down to the left . it could n't keep the right time
1	hang this around your neck and you wo n't forget that next basting or turning on the grill or stove . good loud ring , easy to set , and no batteries needed . had one for four years and it keeps on working
1	i ordered these glasses to have extra for a party . fun shape drew compliments . i now shuffled them in to use as my everyday glasses ( all matching ! ) , but i do have concerns with cleaning the larger glass . with no dishwasher , i handwash everything and i find it hard to reach down into the recesses at the base of the tall curved glass . the smaller one is fine -- my hand reaches
1	we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years . they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine . i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below , but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together , not just by the handle . fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand . ( they are made like hotel china , essentially . homer laughlin is a hotel china company , in fact . the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line . ) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style , i can recommend the fiestaware `` jumbo cups . '' we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee , but also for heating soup in the microwave . they are both great . never been disappointed with fiestaware
0	i bought this unit because the humidity in my apartment on extremely dry days and nights was 15-20 % . the air-o-swiss 7135 was rated top by every web site i visisted and researced before buying this product . it is also rated to work in rooms up to 600 square feet , and the biggest room in my apartment is less than 500 . well to summerize : - hygrostat consistently says 25 % even though my bedside hygo says 15 % . the best i can get out of this machine is 30 % humidity according to my own hygostat , as the one built into the unit does not move past 25 % . - the above situation is in the smallest room in my home , which is 170 square feet , so the 600 square feet rating is totally not true . to close , please be ware that this unit does not work for extremely dry apartments and homes like mine . the other reviews must be in homes that are already at 30-40 % humidity . this is not worth the money you pay for it . i will try running it non-stop for a few days to see if it helps , but if not then this unti will be going back .
1	this unit is slightly difficult to wash since it has the cord attached , but other than that it is easy to use . there are not many settings or buttons to complicate matters
1	the grinders perform exactly as described . they are attractive and i would recommend them highly
1	i was alittle skeptical buying these . but they seem to be working great
0	had major problems with it leaking and ended up having to get another ( different brand ) . i was shocked and a upset because of the mess it left in my kitchen .
0	i have purchased 2 of these from amazon , neither worked . i tried buying them from bed bath beyond , neither worked . this is a horrible company . there fryers are delivered non-working , there sweepers are bad and get recalled if they didnt catch fire . very poor product development . better off buying t-fal
1	i was hesetant about ordering these after reading some of the other reviews on how fragile these glasses are . i am very pleased that i did order them . i am enjoying them very much . they are fragile , but if you handle them with care , i 'm sure they will last a long time . i even put mine in the dishwasher and have had no problems
0	i bought this only because i wanted a pair of stainless shears . you do need your muscles , though . i am using it to remove the fins from fish . good luck
1	i bought this vacuum to use in the bathroom which i share with my cat 's kitty litter box . it sits in the corner and after i clean her box i just sweep the spilled litter over to the vac and voom ... all gone
1	i bought this canister vacuum about 2 months ago and i absolutely love it . it is quiet and i told my husband i swear it picks up the dirt off the basement floor from our living room . i love the automatic rewind cord . the cord is very long and i do n't have to look for a plug in each room i vacuum . i have all hardwood floors and two cats and it really keeps the hair volume `` in the bag '' . the wands are sturdy metal . i have gone through about 3 vacuums in the past two years due to plastic parts breaking . thank you electrolux for the quality build of this vacuum . the only thing that irritates me is i can not keep the attachments attached to the bend in the wand . i finally gave up and put them in a drawer since i seldom have to use them . spring and fall cleaning will be the only time more than likely . i also wish the vacuum wands would stand by themselves when i have to leave the vacuum for one reason or another . but it is still a 5 star even considering those two little things
1	took the pan home and promptly fried a steak on high , thereby causing an apartment full of smoke and a pile of burnt crud on the pan , including a large stain , seemingly impossible to get off . tried everything including the company 's recommended bleach method . no luck ! then i tried baking soda as suggested in one of the reviews here , and it just simply wiped away the damage . like new ! ... ... then i set about reading the instruction booklet and have had great results using low heat . it 's really a different way of cooking , but the fried stuff comes out just as if i 'd used high heat on another pan . stainless steel 's great , too , of course , but this is a worthy and earthy alternative . i take the perspective that the ceramic layer gives the pan a solid foundation for the seasoning process .
1	as previously mentioned , while they call this red , it is really a burnt-orange . if you are trying to match some other red beware ! the potholders themselves are very functional and if color is n't an issue , then buy these !
0	it leaks from the top , barely drips from the pump ... ..but it looks great
1	completely satisfied it boils fast and looks great on the kitchen counter . from england so used a lot for cups of tea.have tried several makes but cant beat this for quality and price m.william
1	i am starting this collection for my mother . it is so adorable . i love that it can be dressed up or down
0	this is a great sweeper , but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery . we bought one a couple of years ago from sears with a sears replacement warranty . since then we have replaced it five times ( we really got our money 's worth from the warranty , at least ! ) it 's getting to be a joke -- one day ( usually 2-3 months after we bring home the new one ) the rotor just stops turning and that 's all she wrote . next time we will purchase a different sweeper , warranty or not
1	it 's fiesta ware what 's not to love ! could n't find this one anywhere else
0	i 'm not happy . the filter needed changing one day out of the box . we have soft water so this should have lasted a while . difficult to hang on to when filling , have to hold it like a baby . does put out the air though and fits about anywhere
0	other than the look , which has now been duplicate by other companies , there is absolutely no reason to buy this incredibly expensive toaster . it does not toast evenly . it does not accomodate bagels unless you flatten the bagel into a pancake with a hole in it . everything is manual , and has to be reset every time , including how long the toast cooks , and whether you heat the elements for one slice or two . the idea that the toaster keeps your toast warm after it 's done toasting is false . the toast is barely warm , and as you 'd expect once you think about it , dried out . the dual lit is all hype , no better functioning than a $ 30 toaster from sears ( or amazon , which is the best place to do business in the world .
0	the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep . this defect in the design , which uses sections instead of one long pole , makes it impossible to use without aggravation . we have put tape around the pole , but it does not work . now we are going to try screws to hold it together . i never saw anything like this in my life , and hope i never do again .
1	i purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines . i have had no issues with the decanture being delicate . infact we machine wash it after each use . the only issue i have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly . other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture
0	see other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning . cool design , but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press . i only used this coffee maker 3 times , and reverted to the press .
0	i have just used this spinner for the first time in a long while . now i remember why i avoid it . it is nearly impossible to get the top and spinning basket to mesh and at the same time get the top with the handle to fit onto the bottom part . the very few times that all has gone together and stayed long enough to get a good grip on the bottom , the greens have come out nice and dry . otherwise it 's an exercise in frustration ! i hope that mine is `` defective '' or something because otherwise i must say pass this one by and find a different design or model and test it in a store before you buy it
0	i have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and i have a lot of experience peeling vegetables ... i am fast and have rarely cut myself . however , i bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago i cut myself so severly with it , i thought about going to the hospital . this peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others i have used and so it some how gives me an out of control feeling with each thrust . it is also extra sharp . i ca n't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well
0	i pre-ordered this right after i saw it on `` i want that tech toys '' and it finally arrived just after christmas , after nearly five months of waiting . the first few days had serious set up issues where the water would n't drain . my cats were interested in watching it but since the water would n't go out they were not interested in using it for its intended purpose . i had it sitting next to their litter maid and they would n't use the new box . their excessive use overwhelmed and burned out the littermaid motor so it had to be thrown out . now , with just the cat genie i hoped they would adapt . they did not - they pee on the floor , poop on the floor . finally one of the four was willing to use the new box ... then it stopped draining and even that one cat would't go near it because it was full of water . i am at my wits end , plugging and unplugging trying to reset it . i have made two attempts to contact the parent company who makes these with no return calls or emails . i am very tech saavy , we have lots of robots around here ... roombas , scoobas , spotbots and others so this cat genie was ideal but i guess it is n't ready yet .
1	i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware . mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice -- sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse ! i was surprised at how small it was , but it did say 6 '' and 6 '' it is . you wo n't bake a pie in it ( unless you make individual ones ) but it will be great for dips and sauces
1	both my fiance and i are very pleased with this warming mattress pad . the dual settings work perfectly , and the variety of heating intensities are excellent . there is also extra emphasis on the feet -- a brilliant idea . well worth the cost , in my opinion
0	while this vacuum is easy to use , it loses suction after only 6 months . do n't buy this to waste money .
1	the dishes not only look good but are a good size , the complete set is really nice . not too dark so that other colours can also be used at the same time
1	i have tried sooo many different roti/tortilla makers . and this saachi is seriously the best out there ! bargainoffers.com company is the best ! they have great customer service and are such nice people . i have tried the crappy villaware 10 inch model as well as the horrible 8 inch revel brand , and i had nothing but problems . they stick and dont heat up well enough . the saachi is great , never had a problem , ever !
1	this little gadget is simple cheap but you 'd have to spend a lot more money to get a cup of coffee out of an electric coffee maker of the quality you get using this . get some really high quality coffee beans , grind'em at home , use about one and a half scoops into your paper filter ( using a small gevalia-type scoop ) , take about 3 minutes ( or less ) to slowly pour your boiling water over the coffee grounds and you 'll have a truly satisfying cup of hot coffee , right up there with french press quality of flavor , but hotter . i 've used the same beans in my krups moka brew and they tasted awful then made the coffee using this , and it made a really flavorful cup of coffee . highly recommended you try this before spending beaucoups of dollars on the high-end coffee brewers . of course , if you 're serving/entertaining folks , you 'll need your standard coffee brewer but for making great , restaurant-quality coffee one cup at at time , this is a nice little product to have .
1	i personally have n't heard a peep about silverstone in ages , and frankly , when i bought this item , i did n't even realize it was made by them . i needed new muffin pans , so i just looked for the best deal , price-wise . i saw this set , and figured it was as good as any . when i received them , i was ecstatic . when you think of something relatively trivial like this , you do n't really expect much in the way of quality , but man , was i wrong ! these things are weighty , very well constructed , and have durable written all over them . i consider it a huge upgrade from my old , flimsy no-name tins , and i highly recommend them for anyone who , like me , bakes a lot and really just does n't want to worry about replacing these kinds of things too often
1	everything about our miele ( red velvet ) vacuumn cleaner is top notch , including the bags . the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag . this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner . this is just a small detail , but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company 's products
1	i had to replace a heart waffle maker as my grand kids love nana 's heart waffles and i had taken it to the beach and left it there . they know nana 's heart waffles are the best as they come from her heart . i love this one even more than the last . it has great controls that make the perfect waffle . clean up is a breeze and it is cute !
1	bought these not too long ago . i use them all of the time . they do a great job on towels , men 's under clothing , permanent press clothing , cleaning rags ( not microfiber , never soften those ) , etc . i find the drying time is a little less , the clothes do not tangle and they smell nice and clean . best of all -- -no chemicals . if you have clothes with a lot of static cling , then you can throw in maybe half a dryer sheet to reduce that problem . i love these `` little guys '' . recommend them to all and especially chemically sensitive folks
0	i purchased this reconditioned item primarily to toast english muffins , which i eat regularly . strangely , i had to set it all the way up to its darkest setting ( 9 ) just to get the muffin to be somewhat browned . i would routinely have to toast more than once to get the desired level of toasting . i suspect there was something wrong with mine , but who knows ? i returned my kitchenaid and ordered a krups toaster ... i am hoping for better results
1	i ordered this four piece set and really like it . the quality seems great and durable . the color is defitely not white . it is more of a light tan color , but the price was too good compared to other sets i 've seen at pier 1 , ect ... so i wo n't be retuning it . just want you all to know it 's not white , but very sturdy .
0	i ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time . i was sorely disappointed . there is no measuring cup , so all water amounts must be estimated ( the unit has three `` lines '' to help , but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs ) ; there is no buzzer when the unit is finished , so unless you babysit it , everything ends up overcooking . this is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled
0	this is a very nice and soft blanket , the best out of all electric blanket . however , i have to return 2x due to the malfunction controller . after only 2 weeks of usage , one of the controller started blinking e and no heat at all . same problems twice ! i ca n't recommend this item until the problem is fixed
1	we have been looking for a reasonable priced armoire for a while . this piece is very sturdy and adds so much elegance to our living room . the instructions for assembly were easy to follow , however it did take my husband and i about 4 hours to put it together . it is well worth the time and money we put into it . i love it ! ! !
1	i live in sw florida . everything down here rusts , even the nails in the walls . i am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives , having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives . amazon has a deal i could n't refuse . $ 90 steak knives for only $ 29.99 . i bought two sets and i could n't be happier . it will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight , after using big clunky steakhouse-style wooden-handle knives for so many years . my husband might not be as enthusiastic as i am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well . i will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case . some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp , but i do n't keep my knives in boxes . no storage room . i have a lot of stainless steel german knives and i consider them to be the best . i have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there , handy and nice-looking . these will complete my collection of nice-looking knives on that wall , handy where i can just reach up and grab them . you just ca n't beat the price , but if you do n't like them you can return them . amazon is the best place i have found to buy everything i need for my kitchen , bar none . i will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures
1	this stock pot is enamel on steel , not cast iron , it was never meant to be . no reason for any confusion . i 've had mine for 5 years , there are no chips or scratches . no matter what i 've made ; spaghetti sauce , posole or any kind of soup . nothing has ever burned , nor has the enamel come away from the pot . turn the heat down , i always get perfect results . lecreuset comes with a great guarantee in regards to workmanship and defects . shame on anyone who purchases cookware in this day and age and does n't follow up with the manufacturer when there is an issue such as some i 've read above
0	all 6 of of the glasses in my set were at least slightly misshapen , one was positively a mutant ! the stems were not centered , and there were , for lack of a better description , glass tumors where the bowls meet the stems . the glasses were also thicker than i expected from spiegalau . other spiegalau items i 've purchased have been superb , so this could very well be an anomaly . ..
1	i purchased this coat rack as a replacement for one that was similar in color and style because it had broken . i could n't be happier with the product i received and i am sure that it will last just as long as the other one that i had . a great buy
0	after reading countless poor reviews of the dolce desk and hutch , i was quite skeptical about ordering it online . ... i gave in and ordered the set from target.com . the desk arrived in almost perfect condition ( a few smudges in the stain ) ; however , only half the hutch was in its box ! the entire drawer ( left side of hutch ) was missing , the hardware was missing , and the assembly instructions were missing . ... i recommend calling your local target store to check the dolce collection 's availability ( and the parts inside ! ) before you waste the time and gas to get there . aside from the missing hutch , the desk looks really great in my home office .
1	they are n't kidding -- this thing is razor-sharp . it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time . the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight ... which is unfortunate , because i like the weight for chopping . but the hollow-edge design is wonderful -- the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper , and did n't stick to the blade . i 'd recommend it
1	this was my first calaphalon purchase and i am so impressed that i plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future . this pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1/2 qt pans.the unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food . hand washing the pan is easy . i love this pan ! !
0	i bought this unit a few years back . worthless at best ! i wish someone - even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units . i called their customer service - who said , `` good luck '' as their best solution . the problem is - aluminum cools off too fast . it will not retain heat . i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake ! do they make them anymore ? ebay - help ! !
0	the concept was great . but after only a month or so , flaws started showing . the inserts started bending and warping , seperating at the edges and cracking . i purchased them for my mother who gave them to my daughter as a gift . she loved the idea , but will go back to the wooden boards because i do n't think these will be around long . and they were not cheap either
0	petmate makes a great fountain , but their black model should be discontinued . it is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it . when i went to wash this fountain , like i usually do every couple of weeks , there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it . i think the pump motor might have been leaking ( i 'm not really sure ) . if i had their white fountain i would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away
1	this was one of the best buys for the kitchen . i hate brown lettuce , and this makes sure it does n't turn brown . you ca n't beat the price , either ! i recommend this to everyone !
0	loose shape and becomes literally towels within 3 months of use . total waste of money and shipping
1	i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago . easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses . my wife can even use it without burning stuff - which she admits is a feat for her - so she uses it several times a week too . it holds heat well , cleans up easy , and the lip on the corner works great for draining . only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove - with gas you should be fine . it has n't seemed to effect the performance though , and for the money it is quite perfect
1	i have been using calphalon cooking wires . but those were costly . recently i have purchase this set which seems to be equally good . the only thing needs to be taken care is `` do n't cook at high temperature ''
0	this product is a poorly designed piece of crap that is destined to fail from the first day you use it . a friend had purchased this item a few months back and asked me to look at it when it died recently . ( i have been repairing electrical and electronic equipment for almost 30yrs ) . this is a perfect example of a `` throw-away '' item . if more care had gone into the design and a few more dollars into producing it you might have a product that could last a few years . neither was done . look at how many reviews mention the item failing after only a few months ... and even the positive reviewers usually have only been using it for a month or so- do yourself a favor and buy a commercial grade hot plate from a reputable manufacturer . you will pay more but you will likely still be using it many years from now . ( not too mention that the operation will be better also ) . how much `` value '' is in a $ 20 hot plate when it is headed to the landfill a few months from now ? it is a shame that so many people are willing to accept low quality products these days and think it is ok if it lasted a few months ( note the reviews ... ) good luck-
1	i am very pleased with this mixer . it is just as i requested . received in excellent condition . the performance reaches all of my expectations in a kitchenaid appliance .
1	i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 . i found out that after i put her to bed , she could not go to sleep right away . she would use a flashlight to do little reading . well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light . it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes . my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes . i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks . they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes . but it does do the job
0	the sheets say they are sateen , but feel more like basic cotton or flannel . since i was really going for that cotton sateen feel , i 'm not impressed . i have a queen sized bed and have not had any problems getting the sheets to fit on the bed - even after washing - as some other reviews stated .
1	i ordered two of these great fiesta handled carafes in black . i plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces . black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so i had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase . i have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces . i was not happy when i received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips ( where the white under the glaze shows through ) as well as scratches in the glaze ( which i have never seen before and ca n't imagine what happened to put them there ) . in my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds . i love the pieces , i 'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish . i also received a black covered butter which was blemish free
1	the electrolux sweeper that uses these bags is very expensive and so are the bags . if i had known that i could only purchase these online i may have chosen another vacuum system . but , on the bright side , the sweeper works very well and the bags are not too challenging to put on and remove
1	i bought this as a upgrade from the glass carafe that came with my aroma control machine . i was tired of burnt coffee due to the burner burning it . this carafe keeps coffee steaming hot for hours . a great upgrade
0	before i purchased this product , i read several reviews , many of them very favorable . this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning/restoring company i recently used for my tile floors . imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is . it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor , and an even worse job of sucking it back up , leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor . i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it . i 've tried other bissel products which were fine , but this one is an expensive dud . do n't waste your mone
1	as i tend to `` nurse '' a cup of tea at the office for a while , i decided to purchase this product this after looking around for a good desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug . such a product just does n't seem to exist ; check the amazon customer ratings . i had one a number of years ago , and it was lousy ( had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap , but no one has ! ) i purchased this mug just about a month ago . it 's so good , i had to share the secret , and even if an improved electric warmer did exist , i do n't think i 'd bother with its cord and risks given how good this is . i 'm sorry to see , though , that it 's no longer available through amazon ( perhaps elsewhere on the web ? ) . i can make a mug of tea ( a generous 20 oz ) around 10a.m. , and even by mid to late afternoon , 4 or 5p.m. , it 's still warm enough to enjoy . and that 's after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough to drink ! indeed , if there 's a `` fault '' with it , it 's almost too efficient if you use boiling water for the tea and want to take a sip right after you 've finished brewing ! though called a `` travel '' mug , it wo n't fit into any auto cupholder i 've seen . it 's really perfect for a desk . it 's relatively low ( taller than a typical ceramic mug , though ) , the base is nice and wide , and there 's a ring of rubber/silicone type material ( which has not scuffed anything on my desk ) around the edge of the bottom that really is non-slip ; between these features it seems quite stable . the removable black plastic top ( friction secured with the typical silicone type o ring around the edge ) allows you to move the opening anywhere you want , to use left or right handed . there 's a simple slide to open/close the drinking aperature . the interior is also stainless steel , so no plastic taste . even with boiling water inside , the outside remains virtually at room temperature ( as you 'd expect , given its thermal efficiency ) . my only complaint ( minor ) is that it is not dishwasher safe ( and i have n't tested it ! ) , but it 's easy to hand wash. with the wide mouth , you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom . i have several inexpensive auto `` insulated '' mugs ( key word here , i think , is `` inexpensive '' ) , that are truly underwhelming , so initially i did n't have high expectations for this , but it really is fantastic . if you want a hot beverage to keep for several hours on your desk , this is for you ! no regrets
0	i bought this for my cat a few months ago , because he just loves playing with a laser pointer . the whole concept of this toy was great but they should 've expanded their ideas a bit more . for the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does . i 'm not sure about others but most cats i know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser , maybe even jump up the wall . as opposed to with the bada beam that just goes in a circle , reversing its direction every once in awhile . my cat never avoids the laser pointer , when he sees that red light he jumps right up ! but with the bada beam , he will just sit and stare at it . the whole point is so that you do n't have to hold it and let the cats go crazy ! nope ! it 's one thing for me to be disappointed , but it 's clear that my cat was more disappointed .
0	hoover has a known problem with the belts stretching out on all the self propelled vacuums , but wil do nothing for customers stuck with them ! we must replace the drive and propel belts every couple of months . rediculous poor customer servic
0	i was kind of disappointed with the black decker power mop , it is to bottom heavey to flip the scrubbing brush easily . you have to use two hands to flip the brush down and two hands to push the brush away . i have already told friends `` do n't bother to spend $ 49 for this mop , it is n't worth the money . get a women to design this product . i ca n't believe a women would have found this easy to use .
1	works , looks good , fits in the fridge well enough ... .i 'm happy with it :
0	i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it . i was so disappointed with the quality of the product . the sheets are extremely rough , thin and scratchy . the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one . since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character , i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it 's trademark . as such , i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding
1	this mattress pad fits my cali king mattress perfectly and the quality is exceptional . i highly recommend it
0	i was very upset with these sheets and how much lint is still coming off . it totally clogged my dryer . i have washed them 3 times and i still come up with a trap full . should have sent them back .
1	my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer . we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine . the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we do n't have to worry about the bottom falling out . the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well
1	this product was much better than i expected . i have owned a cuisinart hand held mixer for over 10 years and it recently gave up the ghost ( too many cookies ) ! so in searching for a replacement i tried a kitchenaid mixer instead . what a disappointment ! it did n't have the power i had experienced with my 7 speed cuisinart . i did n't want to spend more money on another 7 speed ( and i could n't find one locally ) so i decided to try the 3 speed figuring i would have to settle for a degrading in power . surprise , surprise the 3 speed is just as good if not better than my previous 7 speed and less than half the price ! i would definitely recommend this mixer . good product and i have always found cuisinart 's customer service people to be helpful when i have had to call
0	this product arrived in what appeared to be good shape , but upon washing became blotchy and discolored in places making them unusable . very disappointed
1	excellent for fall spring here in florida . fans have a reversible switch which is very handy ( do n't have to turn the whole fan around )
1	i was looking for a tiered cake stand to display cupcakes for a wedding shower , and could n't find one that was priced right and had flat tiers ( there are many towers specific for cupcakes only ) . i finally found this one and it worked out beautifully . a guest from the wedding has asked where to get it for herself . i highly recommend it
0	back in the mid 1980 's i bought a patton 14 inch high velocity fan ; although this fan i am reviewing uses the same name , it is not at all nearly as good as the original . the original actually had three different speeds ; while this one uses three speeds , they are hardly distinquishable from each other ; the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version . the original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version . oh , yes the original 's lowest speed was actually quiet whereas none of the speeds on this new version is quiet . bad substitute and mediocre fan
1	this coat rack is simple and sturdy . it has several pegs for longer coats at the top and below are ones just the right height for my daughter to reach . it can handle many coats and other items you toss on it without falling over . color is nice although we usually see little of it .
1	this sweeper is a real bargain . it makes a perfect backup for a full blown vacunm . ( it is a little iffy on hard wood floors . ) well designed and easy to use
1	we were very skeptical . one of our cats would mark certain spots ( like corners ) occassionaly . but we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room ! it got so bad that we had to discard the rug . we tried boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day , but the one time we forgot to spray , he would mark again . we were at our wits end and decided to try feliway . we bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots . at first we also used the boundary , but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we did n't see any urine markings anymore . it took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work . our cat even appears more calm and pleasant . we make sure that we replace the container of feliway every 5 weeks or so . it 's well worth the money
0	same problem - the surface has begun to deteriorate . we use this pan daily , always using appropriate implements and washing by hand , but still the non-stick surface has broken down . i am going to contact all clad to see if they will stand by their product and replace..
1	the pan arrived on time and undamaged in the factory box . the nonstick surface is slicker than the hardened titanium one used on scanpan , and cleans easily . the rotating vent on the glass lid is a nice feature . my wife was skeptical at first , but i 've caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently- in fact , it 's become their favorite pan ! unlike a pure teflon finish , this pan will brown the food nicely . as far as durability goes , well , it 's too early to tell , but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product . i like it
0	it does n't zap the yap of our newly adopted pomeranian mix . although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it , but it did n't slow her down much . we did everything according to directions , and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact . we have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well . i 'm disappointed with this bark collar though
1	i love my mogu doll this is the third one that i have purchased . i now have two and my sister-in-law who always wanted to steal mine now has her own
1	we already owned the 7-inch santoku knife , purchased locally from a kitchen retailer , and loved it . we were a little hesitant at first since we 've only ever had cheaper knives , but as soon as we felt it in our hands and tried the knife we were sold . still , the 7-inch is a little big for small jobs , so we decided to get this 4-inch paring knife . i coupled a gift certificate with an amazon.com kitchen coupon promotion and was able to get the 4-inch paring knife and the 8-inch bread knife for a very good price . this should pretty much complete our knife set -- from my experience these three knives are versatile enough for almost any job . the 4-inch paring knife , specifically , is great for smaller jobs where the santoku would be awkward . it 's balanced perfectly , stays sharp , and since it 's a single piece it cleans easily and you do n't have to worry about the handle breaking . all in all , great knife , and highly recommended
0	i did not like this product . i 'm not aspiring to learn how to be a coffee expert . i tried this out a few times . it takes 5 mninutes or longer to boil the water . its also a pain to clean and scrub . this is a good option for people who want to learn how to make a perfect espresso . a better option is to use the aeropress coffee and espresso maker . it 's real simple to use and worked beautifully the first time and tastes as good or beter than store bought espresso . you can buy this on amazon . put in the filter , add some coffee , add some hot water , stir , then press down in just a matter of seconds . put this device over a coffee cup . its real easy to clean
1	i have used this vacuum only on carpet , as i bought it for my finished basement . suction is very powerful , it is quiet , and the dirt cup is so easy to empty . the cup is designed so that you push a lever , and it empties from the bottom - very clever and so easy and clean . it is a large dirt cup so it holds a lot . other nice features include a very long cord , and great looks ! the most important thing is suction , and this baby is powerful ! ! it 's amazing what this thing picks up . overall , extremely pleased with this vacuum !
1	i recently upgraded to this machine . i had an antique white that only sewed straight and zigzag ... imagine my pleasure at having a machine that can make 48 different stitches ! i 'm very happy with the product - you ca n't go wrong with a singer product
1	i was very pleased with how quick i received my purchase . i had looked for a long time for bunny cake pan
0	i got these knives as a gift . ironically , the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped `` stainless steel '' . let 's be realistic . these knives are cheap . they 're thin and they 're not well weighted . however , they say stainless steel , and you figure that that 's what you 're getting . i hand-washed these knives and dried them immediately , but they still corroded . now comes the bad part . i wrote to their customer service department twice and did n't hear back . i finally got their address ( from the post office ) and sent them back the knives . it took three months of me emailing and calling them ( with 15+ minute wait times for each call ) to get them to send me a replacement set . the replacement set rusted in about two weeks . that was in september . i just got off the phone with miracle blade , a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say `` i 'm going to finish my sentence '' so their rep would stop talking . they wo n't refund my money . in fact , they wo n't refund anyone 's money after 30 days . the lifetime warranty is for replacement only . they 'll send me another set of soon-to-be-rusty knives , of course -- if i pay the shipping and handling ... again . i asked the rep for his full name , for his id # , and for a manager , and he refused all requests . in summary , if you buy these knives , they will rust . you will want to get rid of them . your only option will be the garbage can
0	i got these sheets and was very pleased with them at first . after a couple of days i observed color sticking to everything around . the worst , it painted my matress in red color ! ! i tried my best to remove the color but it wont go away . now i found the best place for these sheets - in the attic
0	i bought this blender based on the reviews here , as well as its great-looking design . when i got the blender , only one of those factors came through . first thing i noticed : both blender jars leaked badly . after reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible , the leak was slightly reduced . the metal jar still poured out liquids from the base . second thing i noticed : this blender can not make a good smoothie . even after a couple minutes of blending , there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades ( regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie ) . for a blender of any price , the delonghi does a poor job making smoothies . for a blender that costs what the delonghi does , this performance is totally unjustifiable . but , hey , it does look really good
1	i purchased these to use with my steamfast mop . they are machine washable and fit fine even after being thrown in the dryer . perhaps the steamfast head is slightly smaller than the bissell ... i do n't know about that but they fit well on it . they are sturdy and well made .
0	if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment , this is n't for you . the radio is hard to use since it does n't have any indication of what frequency you are on , and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static . the pedometer function is marginal at best . but its what you would expect for $ 15 .
1	i love my spice rack , do n't get me wrong -- i mounted it under my cabinet to increase storage space in my tiny kitchen . unfortunately , sometimes when i spin it ( gently , as always ) the entire rack comes off and falls apart ! the spices go everywhere and creates a mess -- not to mention wastes spices . i had it come off twice in one week . it happens if we spin it clockwise or counter clockwise -- there is no way to 'lock ' it into place , it sits in a channel , but is not locked . so , look out when you spin , or put your other hand underneath it to steady it . also -- really fine spices like cinnamon , tend to escape and dust behind . i do n't mind it , but if you 're a clean freak , it 'll drive you insane -- it gets everywhere
0	i have the black version , but i 'm writing reviews for the white and red as well to save you from buying this toaster model . from day one , it has n't been able to toast anything evenly - be it frozen / fresh /refrigerated bread / bagel / english muffin - you name it . if you do n't believe me , see the photo i uploaded . the toast is burnt and raw at the same time
0	the coffee pot came with the down and timer buttons stucked together . sent it back and received replacement quickly . it was great when it worked , after the 3rd day it did n't come on as programed and the down button got stuck again . the weather display was neat , too bad it did n't work out . i think there is a design fault on the machine . but i have to say amazon has great customer service , we received our replacement very fast
0	i just got this ... took it out of the box ... plugged it in ... and ... it does not work
0	the lcd display do not work right line are missing from the display .
0	i ca n't believe i spent good money on this vacuum . i 've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems : why it wo n't vacuum without pushing it with all my might , why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children , why the filter wo n't stay in place , and why it smells like burned rubber every time am forced to use it . i have replaced every filter and belt . now i am going to throw it away . i 'd gladly give it to charity , but i ca n't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim
1	i love this honey pot ; the design is dainty but the pot itself is really good-sized . a beautiful accompaniment to the matching tea set
1	having used hoover products in a commercial environment for many years i have had great service from them , providing many years of dependable and powerful operation . we were excited to try out this `` new '' hoover model . one of the first things i have noticed about it over the previous windtunnel model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum . this may bother some , but i see it as a testament to it 's improved build quality over the gen.1 windtunnel . this machine is very powerful and it 's dual turbine motor has a confident sound . i 'll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is . it is a nice feature though . i 'll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is . **update** after having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences ... two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 1 ) lacks a bag full indicator . the bag filled on this machine , and then busted ( unknowlingly ) at the top around the bag collar . `` stuff '' went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter . it took another vacuum to clean the mess up . in the future i will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle , indicating how full the bag is getting . 2 ) the cord rewinder is a nice feature , but truly lacks quality . it will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance . a stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference . 3 ) dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head , not that it presents a problem , but it 's unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust . beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns .
0	my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo $ 10 air popper . i saw this one and thought `` what a great idea '' and bought it on the spot . i had n't read the reviews here when i did my heart sank . although some people `` did '' rate it high and said it was great . sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true . slow popping with small kernals . it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere . if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model . it 's simply too slow and requires a `` breather '' . it was returned yesterday .
0	i would not recommend purchasing these sheets . they are thin , not very soft , and they wrinkle easily
1	love it ! fluffy , warm , and light . perfect for snuggling up into on those cold , blustery days or for building a make-shift fort . : ) big enough to comfortably cover ( and keep warm ) many people . and it 's wonderfully light , so it does n't bog you down while you sleep . wonderful
0	do n't buy this wok . it tastes like you are eating metal when you cook cabbage with tomatoes . i ended up returning the second wo
1	a few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall . it works like new . probably not a perfect vacuum but works well . parts are available if you need them . not a top of the line but neither is the price at $ 60- $ 70 with free shipping
1	i just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum . it cuts the cleaning time in half from 8-10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop , and spraying the box down- down to only 2 minutes . it 's just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes/litter maid products i 've seen . and the price is reasonable . i wish i had this for my previous cats i 've owned
0	read the info about this product carefully . this listing is not for kitchen scissors , but rather poultry shears . chef 's choice does make the 8 '' kitchen scissors in the picture , but that is not what you will get if you order these . i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas . i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon
1	it is thicker than other bed pads , but not as thick as i expected . quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on . easy to put on the bed .
1	i love the different speeds it offers . i have found it to be really cleaning the dust from the room.so far so goo
1	i loved my hamilton beach unit and when i got use to the small about of noise that did not bother me . dusting was way down and now that my unit has stopped working i notice a big big difference in the dust and my allergies . i have no idea why it stopped working after only having it for 3 years but it did . anyone else have this problem
0	ok i have a couple of these tongs sitting in a box and trust me that is where they belong.they are hard to use because when you move the slide lock up they open completly wide and if you want to quickly lock or unlock then forget it there are beter ones on the market that can be locked and unlocked with one hand not two like these require and the metal feels cheap and they are very light a slight wind will knock them right onto the floor.spend a little more cash for the oxo locking tongs http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0000ccy1l/qid=1122017598/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_1/002-9480983-6492045 ? v=glance=kitchen=507846 trust me you will like them bette
0	omie izzy are brother/sister kitties about 6 months old . they received this as a gift : `` it 's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we do n't play in it much on our own . one of the wires broke already and we 've had it less than one month . ''
0	christmas morning and the slow , ongoing leak , which we worked around over the last year , finally gave way and voila ! hot coffee and water and grounds all over the counter and floors . and yes , we clean our coffeemaker daily , and yes , we know how to properly run the thing too . ( we gave up on the water filter soon after purchase -- it kept falling into the coffee grounds . ) why the two stars ? we wanted to love this machine ! we wanted it to work ! it is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree ( a mr . coffee ! ) . the clock is nice . the thermal carafe is lovely . until the big leak , we made do with its daily dribble and sputter . but really , after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can , we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did . that 's why i 've bothered to write this review . it is not an inexpensive machine ; the quality is n't there . sorry .
1	fiestaware rocks ! the turquoise place setting is beautiful ... it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com ... fiestaware is functional , calssic and fun- i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this . i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware . i mix up colors that you would n't normally expect to go together and they usually look great
1	excellent , when you want to bake a small cake this is absolutely a great small just the right size of a cake form
1	these cup are enormous ! ( not to mention beautiful , in that fun and elegant way that only fiestaware can be . ) i was looking for a very large , oversized mug because i drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly . i definately got my wish . i have eaten soup and cereal out of these , i even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently . very cute ! i plan on getting them in all of the six colors i have in fiestaware . let me tell you again , this cup is huge
0	bought this at target , returned it the next day . not even close to the quality of b t-r-o 's from even a few years ago . summed up in one word , 'cheesy ' is the appropriate descriptor
1	my husband and i took over a house with 2 kitchens , and i wanted to decorate the smaller one in cream an black . i fell in love with these , but never received them ... they were sent to the wrong address and after the 2nd time , amazon would n't send them again and i gave up . i went ahead and gave them 5 stars 'cause i was at a freinds house and she had these dishes . they were really heavy and the print was consistent . i 'm so jealous
1	i ordered 6 thinking i was getting 6 washcloths . little did i know that they were two to a package and i got 12 . what a special surprise . these are the thickest washcloths i have ever had including those i paid a bundle for at `` exclusive '' stores . i am so happy with them every time i use them . they have never faded or left lint . thanks for a wonderful product
0	this fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room . go for the industrial strength , expensive ones
1	my daughter used this set and now my son uses it . we threw out the fork by mistake so i 'm ordering another set -- the fork is just perfect for a toddler but my almost 6-year old still loves the fork . i 'd highly recommend this
1	i just got into wine a little while ago , and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home , rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler . but seeing as how i 'm anywhere near wine snob status , i did n't want to spend a bunch on a set . enter the riedel o glasses . they were on sale , great price for two glasses . they arrived and i 'm happy with them . they 're sophisticated enough to be wine glasses , but without the stems , they 're not snobby either . i would have given this 5 stars , but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim , almost a little bubble of glass , or crystal . other than that , they 're great
1	of all my global knives i have bought recently , this is my favorite - i just love it . it is very light and so easy to use and has so many uses and especially good for peeling vegetables . one of my best buys .
0	i found at a housewares store ( bed bath beyond or the like ) a shot glass with several different units of measurement : fluid ounces , teaspoons , tablespoons ( in half-tablespoon increments ) and ml 's . much more useful than this product , especially if you 're measuring for weight loss purposes and can have exactly two and a half tablespoons of that salad dressing
0	i placed an online order of the set at ronco and cancelled it 5 minutes later . to confirm my concellation is in time , i called ronco hours later . despite their promise on the phone , they still send the package . after i refuses to accept the shipment ( follow their instruction ) , they still charge me $ 35 for the shipping . these people do business in such disgraceful way . how can you expect a good quality product from them
0	if i had to do it over again i would try a different mat ( something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic ) pros 1. reduces tracking somewhat 2. more attractive than other litter mats 3. does n't take up too much space cons 1. my cat does n't like it -- most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet 2. it 's too smal
0	the first dishwasher that i received from etronics was dented , dirty and looked as though it had been used . i complained , they picked it up , and one month later i got the replacement . it was n't in much better shape , but i kept it anyway because i was tired of waiting . the dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes , and although it cleans well , the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made , and it leaks even with teflon tape . i would not make this purchase again
1	i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker , but when it arrived it was just like brand new , including all original packing , perfect . i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately , but again , it was quite strong in this regard , and froze the mixtures perfectly . admittedly , does n't make a huge amount , but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it . and it 's way quieter than the old fashioned freezers . also it was half the price of a new one . buy it !
1	this product is great . it helped me organize my closet space and my shoes fit perfectly in the slots
0	we bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months . i thought if i upgraded a bit , i could get a bit more milege out of it- like maybe 2 years ... but now with only 5 months of usage ... suddenly no power . totally dead . it is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center are n't too outrageous we 'll try that route , other wise , looks like another waste of money . i have to say that while it did work , we enjoyed it . it was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven , and made great bacon in the warmer- a bonus we were n't expecting . update to this review : i sent in to warranty center and they replaced it with a new one . it took a while and then they sent the wrong item ( same name different product-honest mistake ) but were very very nice when i called and sent the right one out right away- now just hoping this one lasts more than 5 months
1	i had to replace my space saver b on a sunday morning . i wanted another thermal carafe model but was n't realy ready to shell out $ 80 for the braun even witht the good reviews . i found this on clearance at target for $ 35 and i bought a cuisinart gold filter for it . i did not like the fact the mr coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter . anways , there is not much i can say bad about this machine . things i like : looks , brew seletor , self clean feature , makes good coffee , the carafe is one the best i have used . the easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well , inexpensive and work pretty well . i dont have any of the leak problems . things i would change : could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker , the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but i tend to set it to go on before the family is up . overall for what i paid for this i 'm very pleased
1	i just got this waffle maker and have already made a perfect batch of honey wheat blueberry waffles . i ca n't believe how easy it was and how fat and fluffy they came out . i used krusteez mix , because i was out of eggs , and used frozen blueberries . the mix told me to add a little oil for waffles . the booklet told me to plug it in and wait for the green light . i sprayed it with pam . i poured in 1/2 cup of the mix on each side , added blueberries to the top , closed it , flipped it , and that was it . the booklet says they are done when the steam stops . they were brown before the steam stopped , so i pulled them out . no sticking , no spills . i almost purchased an $ 80.00 model , but decided to get this one after seeing all of the reviews . what a great deal
0	i liked this when it arrived . however after a few uses the pestle broke in two . the pestle is hollow and apparently quite fragile , making it of little use
1	great product , very soft . save my expensive mattress from my son 's mishaps several time already . however , one of the stain got though , perhaps it 's not 100 % water proof..
0	i 'm really upset with this item . i registered for it and when i got it the thing did n't work . i called the 800 number trying to see if i did everything right but could n't get a live person on the phone . i went and exchange the item and the second one did n't work . horrible horrible product and business
1	i needed a saucepan to cook oatmeal in that would let go on the bits that stick to the bottom . sounds silly , but i love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards . this cleans up easily and cooks evenly . i have used it for cooking rice , gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well . now , for the lid . there is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently . i sat down , wrote an email to the company and by the next day , they have a new lid on the way . they asked only where to send it , nothing else . i like companies that stand by the product they sell . so , if you are going to buy from this line , check that black band , it should be between the glass and the metal , not on the inside of the lid . if you have a problem with the product , always notify the manufacturer , they will almost always make it right , like calphalon did for me
0	not functional , bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it . impossible to use -the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly . also , it came in a box that was damaged and taped together ( not the shipping box , the polder box that the product comes in ) ... looks like someone returned it previously ( probably for the same reasons ) and it was then sent to me . i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted . time to throw it out - waste of money
0	i ca n't figure out what is so special about this rice cooker so i am irritated by the price which is making me wonder if their whole product line is over priced
0	we got this rice cooker as a christmas gift . we 've tried cooking rice in it three times , and all three times the rice has burned . it simply gets too hot . like some of the other reviewers , we added more and more water , but it did n't help . the cooker finally does kick into `` warm '' mode , but by then it 's too late . we were thrilled when we realized it was non-stick , but what good is non-stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible
0	the slipcover barely covered my sofa , will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside . it keeps sliding off , where i have to adjust it several times during the day , if i could i would get my money back
1	my son is a star wars nut and just loves this blanket
0	i bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels . i thought it would be ergonomically advantageous , which it may be . but on the first pizza i cut ( on the mountain woods peel ) , the edge is now folded over a bit , rendering the edge much , much less sharp than out of the box . so , i would suggest you save your $ 3 and the out-sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while
0	we got this as a present and had high hopes to actually use it as a microwave . it takes over 7 minutes to warm something up and forget about making microwave popcorn it just does n't pop the kernals . overall lots of features but it 's the worst microwave i 've ever owned
0	worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out . guess you get what you pay for
1	appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and watch out for that hot plate burner ! it 's a bit tough on the fingers if you were n't expecting the carafe to be heated . basically , this is a good coffeemaker ; just not quite worth the price tag . for that amount of money , i expected something more
1	living on a ranch , i get a lot of junk tracked into the house . this handy broom vac lets you do a quick clean up and be done . it has been a life-saver and works great on my hardwood floors
0	we made two batches of iced tea in our maker . we could n't figure out why it was leaking but figured most of them do have spout problems . my husband found a crack from the spout upward so out it went . although the instructions say to adjust the spout we never touched it
1	this is the nicest pie dish i 've ever seen . i dont even make pies but i got it to use for serving or to make casseroles or even to use for baking miscellaneous things . it 's diameter is bigger than average and deeper too . the color is deep and rich . i got the cobalt . i will find a place to display this dish it 's so pretty . got one for my friend too . she loves it as much as i do . at 20.00 and free shipping you got ta try this ! maybe i 'll even try a pie
0	i bought this wok 6 months ago . i seasoned it very well and started to use it . but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce . it meant i could n't use it for steaming . when i made a fried rice , i had a hard time to clean it and re-season it . most chinese use a wok to cook everything , so i expected i could do that , too . but i was wrong . this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry . that 's all
1	this is a great product . very quick to heat and i enjoy the dettachable base feature . the cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit ( the lid does n't pop up very far ) and some of the finish does n't do great with steam . overall a good buy
1	i like this pan because of the tapered shape . it cooks sauces without boiling over because it is tall , and it sits perfectly on the small burner with no overlap for even heating . the handles stay cool , and the clean up is easy . beautiful exterior also . like all all clad products , this pan is worth the money . long lasting and well designed . the only thing i wish all clad would add is hash marks on the interior so i could see when i have reduced a sauce to half .
0	i have four 16-piece sets that i received for my wedding . they are beautiful plates , but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave , going through the dishwasher or serving hot food . within 3 months , several plates cracked down the middle , making them unusable . a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added . i did a search on www.epinions.com and found i was n't the only person having these problems . everyone is having these problems . plus , it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces . you have to buy another set . what a racket . the clincher is that they are located in indonesia , so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent . i 've gotten nothing but the international run-around
0	yes , it is pretty . no , it is not a good teapot . i have made tea for over 40 years , in all sorts of pots , and this is right up there with the worst . it drips a lot ! perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout . and no , it does not drip from the spout . rather , lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot . this happens with both fast and slow pouring , with full and near empty pots . this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot . just too much mopping up
0	i have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping ... .while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee , if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it , it will overflow ... .very frustrating as we like strong coffee . because ours has overflowed so many times , the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it wo n't hold water ... .i 'll never buy this frogware again
1	i 'm glad we went back to braun for a coffee maker . tried a few others but they were n't as good . braun makes a hot , good cup of java , faster than most . i do wish they would go back to the 12 cup pot
0	the written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old vornado models that are the best electric heaters i 've ever had . the vh2 has major flaws . it 's single fan speed is way too fast , causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater . the fan can not be slowed down . the thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals ; thereby wasting energy i believe . finally , the thermostat is set so that when at the highest ( hottest ) setting it does n't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees f. i 've had the heater 1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as i have an alternative brand in my home
0	i was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son , but when i took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper . i have washed it several times but it is still very rough . also the first time i washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed . it was very cheaply made , but my son does love it , purely because its thomas i 'm sure . i would n't buy this again
0	saw these canisters and fell in love with them . could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces . they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly . another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off . i was disppointed in the quality . i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive
1	this was my third foil cutter in one month . the other two were flimsy but cost about the same . they each broke in about two weeks . i have had this one for five months and it is n't broken yet
1	admittedly , i am a bit of a knife-buying nut . i love kitchen knives and own chef 's knives and santuko knives from wusthof , henckels , kyocera and furi . this calphalon katana 6-inch chef 's knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance-wise . i like the way the handle is shaped , it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious . i love the way it looks too ! for the price , i 'd say you ca n't go wrong . i really like it a lot ! i have only had it for a few weeks though , but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we 'll see how well it resharpens when the need arises .
1	i thought i would by this product just to try with my senseo machine and some coffee i brought from europe . it works ! i also use it with my tea pods and got a great cup of tea . i will buy more
1	i used this pan just this morning and i really like it . it has a great non-stick surface and is easy to clean . the price is great also . the only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle . it slants downward instead of upward . so , if you have a flat surface stovetop , your pan wo n't sit flat on the surface . i have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me . i did n't notice this from the picture and the descriptions do n't mention this but i think it is important to know . who knows , maybe i got a defective pan and do n't know it . other than that , it is a great pan for the money . i like it more than other non-stick pans i have had .
0	i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it 's extremely poor design . mr. coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers . first of all , the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it . this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless , it 's a filter , it 's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water . so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate . after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe . after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it . the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly . otherwise , the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter , clogging the drain and then voila , you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty , grainy water all over your counters . i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason . get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234
0	first of all add was deceiving : product description new ! non-slip cascading hangers hang up to twelve shirts or blouses , eight skirts , and eight slacks in the same amount of space it takes to fit a single hanger ! store more clothes than ever imagined in your closet and free up essential drawer space . use separately or hook together . non-slip coating keeps clothes on the hanger and off the floor . durable , chrome-plated . 12 shirt hangers 8 skirt hangers 8 pant hangers the last sentence makes you think that is what you are ordering . also , very cheaply made . 2 were broken in the box , one broke while hanging something up . i ended up super gluing them together . i did not want the hastle of sending them back . beware of this product ! ! !
1	i was surprised by the quick delivery . i opened the box to check the bowls . everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present
1	i bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday . i 'm sure she 's going to enjoy using it . i had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing . it was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied . now i just have to get one for myself . well , my birthday is coming up in february
1	i bought this for my husband three years ago , and he absolutely loves it . in fact , many people who come to our house ask about it , as the coffee is superb . we are very picky about our coffee , tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves , and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years . i would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model . the coffee is usually hot throughout the day ( depending on how much is in it , of course ) , as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee . we have never had the first problem with boilovers , leaking , implosions ( huh ? ) , etc . in fact , i 'm getting one for my daughter and her husband for christmas , as they always admire ours
0	i received this popper as a gift , and while it looks nice , it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine . i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn . nothing worked . if i had the receipt it would already have been returned . since i do n't , it is going in the garbage . also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine . stay away from this machine
0	they sent me a blue hudson jacquard diamond love seat slipcover 3 times . i gave up after the 3rd time . what really sux is that they did send the olive sofa cover ! ! ! so now they do n't match ! ! !
0	i 've been through four of these expensive units . they work great on my great pyrenees dog . at least they work for awhile . then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead , then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with , and then i send it back for repair . once i got back a unit that worked again - for awhile . then i got back a unit that never worked again.i stopped sending in my broken units after that . so - in desperation , and impending poverty , i switched to a shock collar ; it was either that or what my breeder calls a `` blue juice special '' . it also worked - and yes , i tried it on myself and decided that it was n't cruel at all . but the punchline is this : the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar . at least they were cheaper , so i did n't lose as much money
0	this is not a 2 quart sauce pan , it is 2.5 quarts , exactly the same as the one that comes with the se
1	this pan along with several others i have acquired from the calphalon tri-ply line is fantastic . great weight and balance , superb craftsmanship , the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all , the pricing is terrific . i have all-clad and yes , it is wonderful but quite frankly i find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less . and it is still made in u.s.a .
1	i recomend this item highly . can be washed without fear of water inside and can be inside the oven while cooking . works like a charm . mik
0	just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place . paid $ 6.50 for item and $ 6.34 for shipping and was very displeased/upset with quality of the item . i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion . thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft .
1	great all around microwave for singles . the only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn
1	excellent . heavy duty and well made . the satin nickel looks expensive . it stands about 13 `` high with a good , strong support base . it should last a lifetime . jdg 3/6/0
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months . at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down . sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down . not what i expect from a $ 70 toaster . well , i have finally given up ( 2 months later ) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon . they are sending me a new one , which i am not sure i am happy about . might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven ... ... ...
0	a drawback of calphalon 's anodized alumninum is that it can not be cleaned in the dishwasher . but stainless steel is dishwasher safe , and amazon 's product description claims that calphalon 's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe . but if you check out www.calphalon.com and look at the description of their stainless line , it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent . so it is `` dishwasher safe '' but you ca n't use dishwasher detergent .
0	this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor , the pur 2-stage dispenser . specifically , i found two main flaws : 1 . the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser . as a result , quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking , even after tipping over the dispenser . 2 . even more infuriatingly , the spigot 's connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place . the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week . i dutifully exchanged it for another one , which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks . it appears that the `` o-ring '' that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold . . . a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator . despite being a lifelong brita user , i exchanged this product for a pur 2-stage dispenser . i am now converted and will never go back . the dispenser is rock solid , and the water even tastes better
1	i wanted to dress up my kitchen a little , and this does the trick ( makes me not dread washing the dishes . an added plus ! ) . it 's a nice cherry red , and i 'm a bit of a `` red junkie . '' i gave this five stars because it 's perfect for my needs . if you have a large family and tons of dishes it 's going to be on the small side though . the red colander 's a great extra , as is the little sponge holder ( it has suction cups to keep it in place , but mine does n't seem to stay stuck . that 's a minor detail , though , and it could have more to do with my kitchen 's tiling than the suction cups ) . one thing to note -- if your sink 's drains are n't centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat . overall , this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set . what more could we want ?
1	i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk . it is great if you like to make lattes . or just plain expressos . it brews fast , less than two minutes . it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans . i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes .
1	in 1970 i was given a set of presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle . at that time they did n't have non-stick griddles . through the years the handles broke , but the grill fit over my stainless steel sink , so no problem . in 1999 i figured it was time to replace it with a new one . i really loved it because it never stuck and once again i could rely on it . in 2002 i started a pancake breakfast to raise money for our club . it started with my presto grill and soon i added a second one . over the next 18 months we raised $ 3,500 with those two grills , serving pancakes , french toast , bacon , etc . my 3rd grill is still going strong and puts out our sunday breakfasts at home . it is so refreshing to be able to depend upon the quality of an appliance these days . thank you presto
1	i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon.com , and i absolutely love the rich , cinnamon color of cinnabar ! the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal , soup , ice cream , and leftovers ( smaller portions ) . it 's microwaveable , too ! if you 've never used fiestaware before , this would be a great introduction to the line , especially if you have use for smaller soup/cereal bowls .
0	the pin is not properly secured to the body of the pitter . after a few uses it will pop off . i 've gone through three of these pitters from my local linens 'n things . how could the designers be so inept
1	the english take their toast seriously , and while i do n't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast , i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams-sonoma for years . about seven years ago , when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound , i bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about $ 100 less than the then-going us price . while it 's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots ( not a big bread item in the uk ) , i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them . the toasting is even , and i actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up , which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled . unlike others , i do not unplug it after each use . never had a problem . the crumb tray is terrific , and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess . i 've had the $ 100 krups and cuisinart models , which burned out within two years . this one is made for restaurant use , and i expect it to last a lifetime . worth every penny , if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools
1	this knife is great for hard cheeses , i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces . it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife . the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily , but if you only use it for cheese , it should stay sharp for a long time . this is another beautiful global knife
1	i could not resist trying this method of making espresso . you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti . the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me ... .the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have . there are a few tricks with the frother ( 1 % milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile ' ) . the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon , pump it quickly and serve . regarding the espresso maker itself ... .just do n't add any more water than to that line..and oh do n't open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top . to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done ... .very quick and yummm
0	i read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it . well that chance did not pay off . even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere . if anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it .
0	we bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from amazon last year , and absolutely love it . after that positive experience , we were looking for something for our kitchen , bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner . starting with the dry vac part , that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine , but anything cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back . which would be fine , but if you lean it back too far , there is a suction filter thing ( made for the wet vac part ) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue . anyway , the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well , but if any of you have small children ( we have 3 boys under 6 ) , do n't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes . now , onto the wet vac part , which was the main reason we got this . very disappointing . we used the included cleaner , warm tap water , etc as the directions indicated , and both my wife and i swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started . it does n't look cleaner , shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean . spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine . we bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors , and i can honestly say that this machine did not do either . as briefly noted above , if you have children , do not expect clean floors out of this , and i ca n't recommend this at all . this product may be suitable for people who have no children , no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic ; i just know this is n't our house
0	these are not riedel crystal ! after i returned them , i told amazon that that need to update the description . if you read the fine print , it does say `` manufactured to exact specifications of riedel , austria '' . they are made by some other company , not in austria , and the quality is very , very low . you get what you pay for
0	we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out . when i saw the refurbished for $ 20.00 i thought it was a great deal . it would have been if it had come with all the parts and did n't leak ! ! it did n't come with seals or with the water purifier . i tried everything including new seals ( that i bought separately ) . eventually we just went out and purchased a new one , because we still like the model .
0	i always buy products from amazon and i never have any complains about any of them . but about this product , i am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz . containers . i hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized
1	getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic . this is a big help . the wide base allows better balance than you would think , and is really very secure . i would prefer a larger balance point , but this does the job
0	because just around the 60 day mark , the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying . i just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser , but a month later ( 3 months after original purchase ) , the thing is spewing soap non-stop . wasted lots of soap this way . changing the batteries did n't help . soap just flows out until there 's none left . to maintain some customer satisfaction , sharper image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control
0	riedel 's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in france of glass ( not crystal ) . the stem 's too short for wine in my opinion , but you could always use them for water . the water glasses are more suitable , though , as they have a wider mouth
1	this is a great pan . aside from the fact that it is easily the best non-stick on the market ( and i have used anolon , calphalon and scanpan ) , what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution . there are no hot spots , not even the center . when sauteing the food colours evenly ( even when the pan is a little overcrowded ) ; when stewing , you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food , demonstrating how even the heat distribution is . this pan also makes a fine risotto . oh , and did i mention its non-stick is simply the best . clean up is a breeze . nothing sticks . even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water . the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan ! swiss diamond is the king of non-stick , as not only is their surface no . 1 , but the quality of their pans is second to none . i own two swiss diamond pieces , i plan to buy more , and i could n't recommend these pans more highly . this is the pan i reach for the most
1	it 's a towel . not too much to say , for more information , read the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams . very good quality , resiliant , color has n't faded , despite being used to dry me off after falling into a creek , being used as padding for my elbow at the firing range , and wiping up spilled cleaning chemicals . tough little bugger
1	this is essentially the all-clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles . the `` dutch oven '' sold by all-clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1/2 quart saucier . this is a versatile stovetop pan -- wide enough for frying , deep enough for liquids , good-looking enough to carry to the table . it can also slide into the oven when needed . it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet , with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans , as one poster complained , but it functions quite well as an `` everyday pan '' for up to 4 persons . the dimensions of 9 1/2 inches by 3 inches ( plus handles ) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape , with a rounded bottom for easy stirring . if you are looking for a versatile `` do-it-all '' pan , this is a good choice
1	this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes . i 've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades ( currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals ) , but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space are n't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities . this little crockpot , however , is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew . i originally bought it , however , because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings , especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop , such as steel-cut oatmeal ( try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once ( also available here at amazon ) you 're unlikely ever to return to instant or `` quick cook '' oatmeal again ) . there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy , delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you . from mid-october to late-march , virtually every night i prepare my entire family 's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot , with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave . other uses we 've discovered : it 's perfect for making serving hot mulled cider ; keeping hot dips , gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet ; as a substitute fondue pot ; for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient ( how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup ! ) . for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space , this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker , especially if used in conjunction with rival 's inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module ( also sold on amazon as of the date of this review ) , which provides the same timed-cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival 's larger , more expensive crockpots . the energy used is minimal , too -- only 80 watts -- the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher , as does the lid , for very convenient clean-up
0	i was tired of replacing wires on my old cheese slicer every couple of years . the blade `` bends '' through a block of cheese . it doesnt provide a straight cut .
0	we got this as a gift used it ... ..its loud and spits out water . we 're not happy with it
0	we bought these for our two girls ( 2 and 5 ) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great , for a while . now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time ( 5 months since we ordered ) . they have n't been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat . same issue with the bowls . ymmv , but when 3 out of 4 are dead , i think there is a problem
0	i used this item twice-the second time i had one sweatshirt and one sweater on the rack it broke into 5 pieces ! waste of money
0	i have two earlier aerobeds and they are very comfortable and conforms to support our bodies . this new premier durasuede is like lying on a sheet of tin . the material is so stiff it does not conform to our body . i find it unusable
1	my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to . but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind . this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly . it sucks great , is easy to clean , and light weight . the price is fantastic
0	i thought i was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price , but instead i got what a paid for and nothing more . cheap product at a cheap price . only used a few times , literally 2-3 times , then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere . luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined . they feel really cheap too . if you only want to use them a few times , get them , i know we will never get these again
0	ordered this item as a gift for my daughter..arrived quickly and did not appear broken or used but would not work at all..appliance would not activate.. very disappointing ... probably why it was such a deal..shipping was as much as the item ! valentine surprise failed
0	okay , i bought for the price . and it is effective enough . but it is very clumsy and unergonomic , so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer . the main problems are : balance of weight , and the switch . first , the switch : because it is a cheap push-in button , which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on , you lose optimum control quickly . the handle is badly placed for this , as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it , but you ca n't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting . in addition , keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife , but because the button sinks deep into the handle , so your thumb is inside the handle as you 're trying to hold and control the knife : quick cramp . moreover , as you 're pushing it in , if the food you 're cutting is moist ( like a turkey ) , juices may run onto the handle , your thumb -- and into the hole into which you 're pressing the button . not safe . a couple times i 've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock ; either way , it was n't good . then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good . look at the huge bulk of the motor -- and then look at where the handle is located , and how it is designed . there 's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is . add in the need to be depressing the power button as you 're holding it awkwardly , and ... 2 stars for effectiveness ; minus 3 for bad functional design
1	i bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores . i hated having to shop around and wish i would have seen a set like this . because i went from a queen bed to a king size - i had to buy new pillows , mattress pad , comforter , sheets , etc . i looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value - plus much easier to buy all at once . i highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress . i was not able to buy the king size set - but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift . cheers ! ste
1	my cats love this ! they will play with it by themselves or with each other . it is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat , but he still loves to play on it .
0	i baked six loaves in this machine . i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things do n't turn out just right . my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures . even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked . i was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe . the machine was quiet , strong , and had a lot of bells and whistles , but with only partially baked bread , i had to return it to amazon . amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back , and were quick enough with the refund
1	these are called `` fruit bowl '' but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream
0	somehow i stumbled onto this item while searching for `` quiet '' and `` fan '' . now that i review the item description i do n't see any mention of `` quiet '' . oops . the fan 's primary flaw is that it only has two speeds , both of which are insanely high . i do n't need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over-heated workspace . a gentle breeze would be great . instead i have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado . on the bright side , perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight . and then , one day , frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan , i can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window , thereby cooling the office naturally . everyone wins ! also , while the fan looks identical to the holmes fan pictured , it is branded as a `` westpointe '' . really . `` westpointe '' with two `` e '' s
1	i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles , but mostly they ignored it . when i got the battery , and the bird started moving , my two older cats were n't impressed , but my youngest ( about 1 1/2 years ) went crazy . it 's pretty funny watching her with the toy ; she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird . it 's also entertaining when she 's finished playing ; she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly , which means she is hit in the backside by the bird . naturally , this starts the fight with the bird all over again . i 'm pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well , but even if it 's just the kitten , it 's worth the money
0	i would rate this item -0- star but it is not an option . there are too many styles/models . it is very confusing . check item specifics carefully to avoid getting the wrong style/model . this vacuum has stationary brushes . save your money and pay the difference for the models w/ spin-scrub
0	this blender died after 4 months of light use . i never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous . i only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts - so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half-frozen berries . after two months the motor started to have that burned smell when i used it . after three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack . at four months , the motor started making funny noises , it smelled terrible , and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use . all in all , this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash . i will never buy a hamilton beach product again
0	i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine . after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet . so now you do n't have filtered water . my husband replaced washer and it still dripped . if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined
1	this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces , however , once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware , you 'll want to buy more . over the years , i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well-known commercial cookware brand , but all-clad is far superior . the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for . the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well-balanced , making them very easy to handle . they heat evenly and cook uniformly , even over low and medium heat . i am very pleased with all-clad 's performance on my radiant cooktop . i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance . well worth every penny
0	one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way , but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier . especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup . i 'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum , and then follow with a functional , well-designed good mop ( like the old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better as seperate units , which is why there 's no washing machine that 's also a dryer . the flip-it is a very loud machine -- so loud , that i did n't hear my phone ring in the same room . this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children , too . it 's difficult to push and feels like it 's gripping to the floor . it does n't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it 's big fat part-vacuum head . and , when you 're finished , it 's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter ( which you 're supposed to keep dry somehow ) so you can look forward to a second job once you 've finished the job of cleaning your floors . and , because of the `` flip it '' back and forth design , the thing has no equilibrium ... it fell to the floor at least 3 times , even when i was so careful to rest it against something ... once when this happened , the `` dirty water '' recovery tank hit the floor , fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . a true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my bissell steammop , and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try , but , sadly , i was disappointed . i do n't review things often , but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean . this contraption is not your answer . on a side note , i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop ( what an excellent product ) , so i 'm hoping that they will one day
1	this is just what i was looking for . i use it for the few dishes that do n't make it in to the dishwasher , but mostly for drying the baby bottles . the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose . this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes
0	sometimes it sprays when she barks , most of the time it does n't . so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low . it 's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog . i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine . ( my children found this amusing .
0	this is an ugly vase . so ugly we are returning it the day we received it . it does not measure up to mikasa standards at all . it looks and feels like a cheap vase one would buy at target . we were very disappointed . stick to the clean , lean lines of other mikasa crystal vases
1	so far , so good . i have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing . i saw one reviewer that said it tore apart , and will update as time goes by . so far i love them ... .well , she loves them . easy for her to pick up , when the ball is much larger than her mouth ( holes in ball ) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions , but highly recommend the blue one , as dogs see blue well ( color blind )
0	this is a great maker for american coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso . this will not pass for a full-time espresso drinker . the machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso
1	the quality of the china is very good . the weight and feel of the product is substantial . i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them . from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive . they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family
1	i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning . we 've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great . highly recommended
1	it 's kinda hard to imagine dimention on a non standart object . it works , and cleans , i guess a bit small , but for the money its well worth i
1	i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office . i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it . i 'd looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior . i broke a lot of rules setting this up . its not connected to the hot water supply , since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines . also , the machine is on the floor , under the sink . i bought new hoses to make the connections . luckily , the standard connectors on the back made this easy - the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line , and the drain can take a piece of garden hose . i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water , but so far its been okay . ( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home , i might not be so nonchalant . ) my unit was used , from an area where there was very hard water , and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine . i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill , the heating element and the wash arm , and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal , and away we went . since we are in an office , we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down . the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot , and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over , if you pop the door open . the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink . one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise . if you load this machine carefully , you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much , and the machine will operate more quietly . we 've found that we can run the machine , have the office radio on , and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble . my only complaints would be that on occasion , the timer has gotten stuck ( once or twice in 100 washes ) . also , some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater . capacity is very decent , probably because the machine is pretty large . measure first
0	this steamer performs very poorly . the wrinkles in my shirts just laughed when they saw it coming . now it sits in my closet collecting wasting space
0	the thing did not work right from the beginning and now the tail fell off would not recommend it to anyon
1	i recently purchased the sakura embossed palm 16 pc . dinnerware set for my mom for christmas . she absolutely loves them . they are so unique and when she has company over for dinner gets many compliments on them . nobody has ever seen dinnerware like these before . she is a big fan of palm trees and these fit her collection nicely
1	i think these little candle holders are great for any occasion . and they are n't expensive either . therefore you can buy any color for any occasion to match any room in your house . these can be used for formal occasions or just everyday use
1	i 'm impressed with the quality of these towels . i purchased them because i needed hunter green and could not find that color locally . they are large , soft absorbent towels
1	very nice peeler except it 's missing a feature that every other peeler i 've ever seen has ; a protuberance that can be used to remove the eyes from potatoes
0	i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser . when it arrived , the teapot was broken , with a large section missing from the side . i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price . after receiving my second teapot , it was cracked in the exact same spot . i returned the product and complained with no response . i was refunded the price for the teapot , but i am out $ 10 in the cost of shipping . it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot , so i would try a different product .
0	i do not think that the batteries were fresh . does n't seem to bother my dog when he barks
0	this towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low -- one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric ( like dust-bunnies ) formed on it too . perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag , but not in one 's bathroom
0	this is a lemon/lime press . the oranges in china must be real small , so if your planning on pressing oranges make sure they are small and forget about grapefruit
1	we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender . the cuisinart took care of the problem . pros : very good power for blending , good battery charge life , easy to clean , clever modular construction ( battery separates from motor , built-in plug and charger ) , does not roll off counter . cons : larger and heavier than the corder braun . this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands . very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 '' long . the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth , making clean-up easy . i do n't recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time . the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft . hand washing is easy and quick . one reviewer suggested that cuisinart 's recommendation of leaving the battery pack/charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries . this may shorten the battery life , but the charger charges them at a very slow rate ; this protects the batteries from what really damages them : heat from fast charging . as the charger draws only 1 watt of current , some may want to leave it plugged in continuously . current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power . do n't run them down completely as was the practice in the past . the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight . they do n't feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised . hot beverages stay hot even hours later . it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning . i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size . i would have preferred something a little wider , but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for ... ..unfortunately it tends to move around in mine , but it does n't spill any thing
0	i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years , and in general i have been happy with them . but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used . the product description does warn you that it 's only heat resistant to 250 degrees , but i was flipping eggs in a skillet , which i consider a basic use for a spatula . if it ca n't handle the heat of a hot skillet , than i do n't think it 's a useful spatula . not to mention that it 's neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food
1	if you want the retro look and a super toaster ... ..this is the one for you . toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever . make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering ... ..it 's a big toaster . shape is unusual ( taller in back than the front ) which gives it a little character ! excellent !
0	i have two cats both less than 5 months old . i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box . it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that 's way over priced . my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic . save your money and use it on something more useful
0	the machine looks great . it sat nicely on our counter-top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy . if that was all i wanted to do with it , then i would have been very happy with it , but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos . firstly , i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use . it rotates , but has little movement up or down . as a result , i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when i was finished . it produced good foam though . secondly , the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not . finally the espressos i made had no crema at all . i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one . after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder . the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere . in summary : if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter , buy this machine . if you want to make decent espresso-based drinks , do n't
1	i searched for a long time before i purchased this product and have not regretted my decision to buy . like all ice crushers it is a little noisy .
0	first i liked this press - good coffee , reasonable price . but in 3 weeks operation , the press itself has already broken . the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken ... may be this pres is good for ones a year usage , but not for everyday ...
0	we bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name . we have been using it for about 4 months now . it cooks good rice . however , the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said . we 've got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason . and the rice was in `` keep warm '' mode at all times . in addition , if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the `` keep warm '' mode for a day , the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy . so , you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout . i have n't tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice . if i were to decide all over again , i would stay away from this rice cooker . i thought i 've bought a top-notched product , now i regret that i spent this much on a rice cooker
1	this dish rack fits into small spaces and holds a decent capacity of plates , etc . perfect for a small apartment kitchen ! love it !
1	my 13-year-old cat was limping for a few days , off and on , and my vet said it was probably arthritis . a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him , and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis , so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try . it really made a difference ! he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake . he was so happy , and so was i . on my vet 's recommendation , i continued giving him one tuna-flavored capsule each day , sprinkled over his food , as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration , all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication . i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis ; and buying it from amazon saved me about 2/3 of the cost from the vet .
0	this waterer is a great concept , but does have some drawbacks . for starters , one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work . the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it . the other dog is just fine with it , but then again he 's deaf , so the gurgle does n't bother him . lol . the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls , it gets dirty . so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl , but it 's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off , clean the bowl and but the jug back on . so , if your dog is n't afraid of the noise it makes and you do n't mind the extra hassle cleaning it , it 's great . otherwise , just get a large bowl ; that 's what i ended up having to do
1	my dog absoluely loves this toy . we have had one since she was a puppy , over 6 years ago , and its still going . this is the only toy that she will play with for hours on end and gets excited when she see it . definitely worth buying , it gives great excercise . we sometimes use it as a distraction when our dog gets anxious
1	i received this knife for christmas after reading the review in cook 's illustrated magazine and then requesting it on my gift list ! my son ordered it through amazon and it arrived before christmas . it is now my favorite knife and is used daily . after cutting veggies , fish , meats , and fruit , this knife continues to be extremely sharp , well balanced , and easy to use . what a great gift
1	the riedel syrah/shiraz wine glasses are a nice combination of fine glassware , yet also have a sturdy feel
1	i have tried all kinds of feather pillows and foam pillows but just could not get comfortable sleeping on my side . while shopping for a new mattress , i came across the simmons beautyrest pillow . what a difference ! it provides great support but is still soft and comfortable . now i do n't toss and turn all night , and i actually get up earlier in the morning and feel rested for the first time in a long time . i definitely recommend this pillow for people who sleep on their side and are looking for good support
0	the towel is quite soft , however after using it , your body will be covered with small fibers all over . - not recommended
0	i bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful . it fell apart the first time we used it . it even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood . i do not recommend this product at all .
0	the other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have . it pales in comparison to my old hamilton beach , however , in several respects . well , really , one big one . it 's a plastic object . and it gets very hot . too hot . hot enough that it smells like it 's melting itself . i got this as a gift , rinsed it thorougly , boiled a pot just to clean it - and it stunk like melted plastic . ran it again to try and get the smell out . same thing . rinsed it with cold water and tried again - still melted odor . the outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off ( a problem i did n't have with my previous kettle , which i lost in a move ) , and when i touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger . you can bet i put this right in the mail back to amazon . i normally would hesitate to return a gift , but i 'd rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust
1	i 've had my juicer now for about 3 years , and i have n't had any problems with it . in fact , after having had several juicers , this one is my favorite in the price range . i also do n't understand the customer service problems . one of the rubber feet on the bottom split , and i called customer service . a week later i had four new ones in the mail ! pros - much quieter than most juicers of its type . as well , i did a side by side comparison with my buddie 's juiceman juicer , and my yield was approximately 30 % greater . cons - as with any other similar juicer , cleaning it gets old . that 's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times/day
0	i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top . i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer
0	the pans look very nice and very durable-but they are not ! ! ! save your money do not buy this ! ! ! i had to put them through the dishasher a second time to remove some more of the sticky residue on the bottom of the pan from the label . when they came out of the dishwasher there were rust spots all over them . i am going to try and return mine as soon as i get a chance . i never even got to use the pans before they rusted . it should be noted that a ) the pans were never left soaking in water or in the sink b ) there was not anything even the tiniest bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have `` rubbed off '' rust onto them or anything like that . horrible , horrible pans-they should be ashamed to make or sell these ! !
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas . i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use . some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans . maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them . the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly . i feel we made a good choice
0	i am extremely happy with this product . it works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick . it 's a superb design and i am very pleased . i would highly recommend it
0	i returned them beacause they are nothing like the good old revereware made in the u.s.a.they are very thin and cheap.i do not recommend anyone buying them , you willonly want to return them
0	while the water tasted better , this model did n't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place
0	i have sold a number of this style timer made by kitchenaid in pink , black and white . almost every buyer complained . all complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room , have a fan on or are listening to the tv or radio . replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either . if you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the red , black , blue , white or tangerine ones that are entitled digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of kitchenaid timers .
1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party . it was the talk of the whole school . the kids loved it . i used sephra chocolate ( a coupon was included ) , so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil . the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression . the cascading , flowing , chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box , but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil , but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine . i also saved $ 25.00 by buying the chp ( champaigne color ) version
1	these mikasa spoons go perfectly with your demitasse or espresso cups . very delicate with nice finish . we enjoy them every time we use them
0	i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter . it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away
1	i really like these glasses . they are attractive and pleasant to hold . i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine - which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line
1	i love that it has a mini bowl . so much less storage . also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach . i am so impressed . love kitchen aid anything
1	this sharpener is exactly what i hoped for . i have used it enough to overcome the learning curve and am very well pleased
0	i 'm a student in college , and when my first hamper ripped , i decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper . my roommate rarely does his laundry , so he has huge loads , but his hamper manages to carry it all . i saw the whitney design hamper online , which looked nearly identical to my roommate 's hamper , so i bought it . when the hamper arrived , i put my clothes in it , and prepared to do laundry . the shoulder strap ripped right off . i did n't even fill up the hamper all the way , as is shown in the picture . amazon sent me a replacement , but now i am afraid of using the shoulder strap again , and i have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires . this hamper may be able to function , but not well . and for a college student , this is definitely not sturdy enough
0	had this grinder for 8 months . two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit , now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds . i 'm tossing it and getting a different brand . all form , no function
0	read the fine ( or missing ) print carefully . this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase . you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets ( another $ 100 ) . if you want to return this item , they charge a restocking fee of 10 % and also deduct for the shipment ( even if you got `` free '' shipping ) and you pay to ship the thing back . we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores - which is where the miele came from .
0	this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says , even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing . if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing , it is luke-cold ! i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave ! it is hard to clean and very loud
1	very good rice cooker . the steam function is very useful for such a lazy student like me . i can cook the rice and steam my food at the same time . i used it for almost a month but still working functionally . highly recommended if you dun wan na pay too much for a useful rice cooker
1	i internet shopped for a week , reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made . i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did . i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast , easy job . ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly . it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power . i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal , the pitcher is thick , solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless . i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 , yes just 2 speeds . i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used , they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons . the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous .
1	i 'm very happy with this mixer . it arrived in pristine condition , even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn . the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints . i bought it mainly for bread making , and after a certain amount of practice , i 'm turning out great products . i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients , so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard . my only gripe is not with the machine , but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured . i got the hd . i have researched as much as i can , and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting , but i just do n't understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying . seems kind of elementary to me
0	the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top . i was sent new doors but they did n't fit . frustrated , i accepted the promised $ 175.00 off to keep the doors , knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later . i have yet to receive this refund . the delivery was also a major problem . there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go . there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone , so i tipped him to bring it in for me . i will never buy anything from this company again ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews , but it is n't so hot . the light is n't very bright and quite diffused , and the light sensor is n't sensitive enough - it stays on in all but the brightest light . i ordered two , but have only opened one , and the other is likely to stay in its packaging
1	it does everything i need it to and more ! i 'm a raw foodist so i do n't need something that will `` cook '' foods like some of the other high-powered blenders will . however , if that 's what you need one for , this will do that , too . the l'equip is the only blender i have ever used without the lid ( not advised for households with children ) . i can start it out at a crawl and go up to blindingly fast with a turn of the knob . i liked my original one so much that i bought one to have at the office so my green smoothies could be made fresh for lunch . alton brown was showing off his appliances on `` good eats '' and he has a l'equip , too . made me feel famous
1	these are gorgeous bowls . they are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking . i am very satisfied with them - no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily . and they look fantastic on my pot rack
1	this is the cutest comforter , not the softest , buy my son loves it ! i had n't been able to get him to sleep in his own bed all night but as soon as we got this it was no problem . he loves to sleep in his 'thomas ' bed !
1	i love the large size of these tumblers , as i can get a whole can of pop with ice in them . the thermal feature works good , the ice lasts longer , and they do n't sweat , so i do n't need coasters under them . they are colorful , so each guest can have their own color , no mix ups . they fit on the top rack of my dishwasher , and they do n't seem to be marked or scratched yet . after seeing mine , my daughter-in-law got some , as did two sets of my friends . i am so glad to have found them !
1	have had the granos for about 1 month . great espresso , great latte and great design . i hope all the leak issues i read below have been solved , but only time will tell .
1	perfect for anybody who appreciates no-frills , straight lined , attractive furniture . it 's modern and sturdy and a great match for my kitchen dinette set . i love it ! and the price is right , too
0	sure , it looks nice enough without anything on it . but if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it , pick something else . it 's tippy and it does n't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off . it 's cheap , but you 're getting less than what you pay for . it could n't last a winter when being used by only two people
0	while the wine pourer works as advertised i am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper i was originally seeking . i was after the pourer that came with a `` flapper '' at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings . while the above item fits the bill as a spout i personally find it useless
0	i bought this item - `` drinkwell fresh water fountain and reservoir for cats or small dogs - fountain ( 6 cup capacity ) '' from petsmart at amazon . though the title clearly advertises that a reservoir is included , one did not arrive . i contacted customer service who told me that the reservoir is not included and would only assist me in ordering one . otherwise , the unit is nice , though simple . i will be returning it used to purchase elsewhere
1	i used this skillet for the first time and it was great . i love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use . it cleaned quickly and required no seasoning . also , its a really pretty skillet . the sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates , shipping info and the skillet came quickly through fed ex . very good customer service
0	after just a few months of occasional use the lever to lower the bread would not stay down . i see now that others have had this problem . typical `` made in china '' junk . no more t-fal for us
0	when we first bought it , it worked nicely and smoothly . thought we do not need to buy another opener again . boy were we wrong ! after the third use , it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning . reminds me of a car turning it 's wheels will all smoke and noise but no results . glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand . this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name
1	i think i 'm a little crazy for buying this . i just had to find out if the copper-core was really better than an aluminum one . it is , but not by that much . you can buy a pan from cuisinart 's multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price . that being said , this thing is very well designed . the rolled-lip is useful for pouring . the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there ( a problem with most pans ) . the handle stays cool and is well designed . overall , this is the best 2-quart saute pan money can buy . is it worth it ? that 's up to you
0	its a throw . like a blanket . i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it . it would be better than what i wasted my money on . also dont wash this with anything else . the die leaks
1	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays . as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation . as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb . chickens . it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck . the pan looks good from oven to table . yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron , but i 'm really glad to add this to my pantry .
1	there was no dimensions on the description so i took a chance . it was a bit smaller than i thought ( about 2.5 '' cubic ) , but that happens to work out perfectly for my purposes . it is lovely , and the color really adds to the kitchen . my guests all loved it
0	you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food . it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat . only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they 're doing . do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok
0	i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address . it worked for two days and then it stopped . on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour , but it only worked intermittently . she did n't keep the receipt so i 'm writing it off as a waste of money . when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense . you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries . i do n't buy the argument that the hands-free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands
1	for $ 19.99 , you 'll not find many knife sets . i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife ! this set includes a long slicer/utility knife , one large paring knife , and a 5 or 6 '' serrated knife . the knives consist of good steel , comfortable grips , and are well balanced . they are very sharp and sturdy . i could n't find a better set for the price . i was looking for a decent utility/carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set . i use mine as the `` disposable '' knives . for this price , you wo n't have to worry about beating up on them . and they sharpen up quickly , too . the red color is very festive . the grips feel like silicon , so they work when wet and greasy . and pleasantly squish when you grip hard . if you are in the market for a fine , high level kitchen knife , these may not fit the bill . but if you are looking for good quality , inexpensive knives , you wo n't find better in this price range . i paid $ 19.99 dec-200
0	the seals are not air or water tight . there is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window , but i can not store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them . the canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove
1	this is wonderful . i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid , but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me . i actually enjoy working with this . the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer , but using really good litter , and not too much of it stops that . i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this
0	after reading the reviews on this product i thought it would be a great space heater for my apt . i could n't have been more wrong . it barely gets hot - even on the highest setting - and gives off almost no heat ! ! perhaps mine is defective or got broken during shipping , but it was a huge waste of money . i have had to go out an buy another space heater already . it is so frustrating . one word - do n't !
1	i just received this griddle today and am so disappointed to find on the small print on the box ( and not in amazon 's description ! ) that this griddle can not be used on ceramic top stoves . it 's a beautiful piece of cookware , heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges . exactly what i wanted , but very unfortunate that amazon does n't tell you that it wo n't work with some stoves . the warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top . probably would have given it 5 stars if i could have used it
1	it is hard to find spoons for tall drinks . these are excellent quality- nice heft and good looking as well . highly recommend
1	using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing , and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for . after the water is brought to a boil , it 's important to wait for it to cool just slightly ( about 30 seconds ) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter , wait for them to drain , and then fill the pot with water . want more than a single cup of coffee ? you wait for your first pour to brew , and then fill the filter again . some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing : 1 . taste : i do n't know how it does it , but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter . 2 . cleanability : users can keep all necessary components clean ( anyone who 's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that was n't there when you bought it understands this plight ) . oftentimes , the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it 's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir . some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse , which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot , but if you 're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass , then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean . the best thing i 've found : a baby bottle cleaner . it 's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls , too . brilliant ! 3 . electricity free : as long as you can boil water , you can have coffee . 4 . mud/sludge : french press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee . do n't get me wrong : i think that 's good ( i use a french press when i 'm in the mood ) , but the cone on a chemex does n't allow that at all . 5 . style/size : the chemex coffee pot is a relic ( designed in the 40s ) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it 's a wonderful , minimalist sight on any kitchen counter ( and unlike electric coffee makers , easy to move if you need the space ) . some drawbacks any purchaser should consider : 1 . time : it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee . 2 . cones : you ca n't run over to wal-mart when you use the last filter ; you need to find a specialty store or go online , which means you need to plan ahead . 3 . cold coffee : no electric hot plate ( thank god ) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly . you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop . i think that 's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor . just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee . 4 . learning curve : it does take some time to get the grind right , the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue . 5 . cleanability : i know this is in the advantages column , as well , but it 's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things . to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff ( which is a small pain ) else it will get nasty over time
1	i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife . she loves it . our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or , for that matter , on the box it arrived in . the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives . the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add . apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it . we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for $ 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 . i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me . the knives are well crafted , have a great feel , extremely sharp and we love them . there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other . we also love the selection of knives , especially the paring knife and small serrated knife . some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we 've not noticed either of these conditions
1	the price was excellent . ordering was quick and easy . delivery was prompt . the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen . they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle .
0	i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo . they appeared to be very sharp . however i did not like these knives for the following reasons 1 ) i dont care much for the cheap plastic-like orange handles 2 ) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap . furi implies that these knives are made in germany . however they are cheaply `` made in china '' . now generally i dont care that much .. everything is now made in china anyways.. but when i am paying so much money for a product , i was hoping it was made in germany or usa . 3 ) the case is even more cheaply made . personally , i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews , mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand ( which mine does not suffer ) , but i decided to order it anyway , figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand ( you can also wall mount it ) . well it has paid off , as the magnets work as promised , the tines stay sealed tight , and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices . i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own . as for labels , there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices . i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack , and it has worked beautifully
0	i loved this vacuum initially . you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however , the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately , to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint . you ahve to empty the filter every 5-10 minutes . i do not have a terribly messy household , just one with no stairs going to the front backyard
1	this bread tray is perfect plum ! ! the color is amazing , and the tray is so useful for so many things ! ! get several of these !
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working
1	i overheard a flight attendant raving about the neckbones and also saw it reviewed highly in shape magazine . i still have not tried it in the car or on a flight , but am excited to . it does feel comfortable , though is bigger than expected , so pay attention to the dimensions before you buy
1	wow , this salter kitchen scales is highly accurate . i always get a perfect bake everytime . i definitely recommend this product . you 'll never be disapointed with its quality .
1	this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great ! i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart , which at best made mediocre toast , and had that icky plastic worn out look . this toaster is metal , sturdy and has a great retro look in today 's colors . mine is red . i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer - a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen . amazon service has been great and with the $ 25 off i got some great buys
0	i had researched this product for juicing ability and power . i ended up buying this one and after using it *twice* the motor just shut off . i returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement . i decided to try juicing carrots and celery , and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again . i might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it . if you are juicing small things , like berries , with larger vegetables/fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade . i know i read these bad reviews and said , oh that wo n't happen to me ... but it did . i hope you choose a different juicer
0	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell , i have 3 dogs , i put it on and they went beserk , they started going after each other , i did n't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure the dogs did , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , the tone must have made them lash out like that . i can not use it anymore .
1	this is a mid-size whisk , not a full-size one . if you understand that you 'll be happy with it . it is a simple item , does what it is supposed to , and looks great doing it
0	i wanted a humidifier that was silent , but when i plugged this in , not only could i hear it from the other room , but it 's a high-pitched whine . i do n't know what to do about it . i think i 'll probably just return it for something different
0	the problem with this is that ( as it appears to me ) villaware has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it 's panini grill ( which for the record is an excellent product - which i have given rave reviews ) . check out the panini grill - unless you had these products in front of you were able to open them up , you 'd never be able to tell the difference between them . i would say , do n't write off villaware products just because of one poor one , as i said i also own the panini grill love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! however , do n't waste your money on this one - i hope villaware does right by their respected name pulls this off the market completely . one thing i will say , the `` audible warning sound '' that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click - the same as the panini grill , but listen carefully or you 'll miss it
1	the best product ever ! i have 5 cats ... and let me tell you ... if it were n't for this product i would have gone insane a long time ago ( or i 'd just have a very stinky household ! ) have used it for a long time , and will continue to do
0	i was very hesitant to spend close to $ 160 on a single fry pan , but i had heard so many good things about all-clad and thought it would be a wise investment . for the first 6 months , the pan was great . i loved the large size and used it often . i was just about ready to invest in an entire set of all-clad cookware when my pan warped . i was using it on an electric stove as usual , and the pan just simply warped . i was thoroughly disappointed that a $ 160 pan would warp during normal use . i wo n't be spending this kind of money again . ****follow-up . i contacted all-clad regarding the warped pan-they had me send it in for evaluation , and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door . i 'm impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product .
1	i have never used any other dehydrator 's and found this very simple to use , clean , store , and the price was great . plus it makes my house smell great when i 'm using it . so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however , the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i 'm finding it enjoyable to use .
0	i placed a substantial order , mattresses , sofa set , table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was `` too much '' nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site . this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio
1	i wish i would have bought the regular one instead of the paperback version . i love this light . i can see everything and do n't get the shadows hindering my reading . i prefer to read in bed and this allows me to do so without waking up dh
1	the refill accessory ( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes ) definitely cuts the refill-maintenance in half . since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often . you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended . a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher-safe , and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual . throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly-shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected
1	we 've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it . it toasts consistently . it accommodates all widths . and the digital selector is great
1	this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines- cute as a button ! it works the same as the large madeleine pans , and is made from the same heavy weight metal , but the result is darling . would be great for tiny `` garnish '' on a larger dessert , for a tea , or just because some people prefer small doses of good things !
1	love this product , excellent cheese cutter , three choices of thickness . highly recommended
0	my order was cancel because company will not ship to a fpo fp address , really unclear as to the reason , but i am sure it is a fine product , my turtles will continue to bask on their rock
1	love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh . this one holds a larger amount than others i have had . it is a bit more awkward to hold , however . it has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up . love the emile henry colors
0	this product is the worst there is . i purchased it in a target store going by the oster name . it takes forever for it to heat up and then another long wait for the waffle to be almost done . needless to say i am taking it back .
1	i got this for our 3-year-old daughter 's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater . it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room , which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night . i would n't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room . the top and back do get hot , although you 'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned ; bumping into it should not cause any burns . i have n't noticed any odors or noises from it
1	we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand , that after 2+ years was no longer bouncing back into shape . this serta topper is just fine , as comfortable as our last one . my big complaint is that someone at serta ( though serta is n't the actual manufacturer ) needs to measure a queen sized bed , because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides . if you place the topper in the included protective cover , it 's several inches short on all 4 sides . i know 1 inch sounds minor , but if you 're a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed , the topper does n't protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress . as far as toppers in general , we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed . you do n't feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper ( though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more ) . definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford , and the thickest you can afford
0	i bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews , but it was a complete mistake ! it really was dingy like described by other reviewer . i returned it , but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item . i highly recommend against this product or seller
1	i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two . it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and does n't take a lot of counter space while you are using it . its the perfect size to make pancakes , eggs and bacon ! we used it to make grilled cheese , and they came out perfect ! this would be great for singles , college students , and anyone who likes great things in small packages
1	the product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch ... there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area , which came out with laundering . other than that , the sheets are great . the lace needs starch and ironing . the fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses , these two beds are put together to make a king bed . this product was a christmas gift and it was well received
1	this maker pours well and has a soft handle . we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online . nice little coffee make
0	i returned this -- absolutely unusable . could not keep bottle engaged while pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms
0	i 've own my x3 for about 2 years now and overall , it has been used to make one double espresso daily . so when it stopped working a month ago , i was heartbroken . called ff , after some back and forth i sent the machine in for repair . the cost of repairing it is about $ 200 , incl . the shipping . add that to the $ 499 i paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine . after several days of back and forth with customer service , i still do n't know what exactly is not working in my machine . apparently , there are 3 items that have failed , one being the thermostat , a washer and something else , that cs was unable to explain . i really liked the machine when it was working , so i gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair , but at the end decided against it - i rather purchase a new rancilio silvia . when i called the cs with me decision and asked them to send the machine back , i was told that on top of the $ 12 shipping there will be a $ 13 handling charge for packaging the machine . i refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty . long story short , i finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge , but that was one very unpleasant experience . it is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight i had with them . i really liked the x3 when it was working , and i would love to have it back , but it is just not cost effective at all . what is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance i provided , it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine , it should have worked a lot longer without any problems .
0	as of today , 3/24 i have not received this product . very disappointed with delivery
1	i 've have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths . they are also a nice large size . so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they can not be wrung out properly . the colors of the towels are also beautiful . i 'm buying more for our guest bathroom . thank goodness i searched on amazon . i do n't believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else
1	great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice ! ! ! you have to spray the pan really , really well with cooking spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the cornbread to come out in one piece . i run a little spatula around the edges before i dump the pan . gave one as a gift at christmas and it was a hit ! ! !
1	when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b/c the materials are light-weight . but , i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic . it was just so easy and looked so good ! i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer . unlike other reviewers , i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all . maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts
0	i bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and did n't lit on ; i did n't matter because they look beautiful underwater ... one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too ; i replaced the beams but they stop working days later . it 's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium . ( unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks )
1	this is a well built pizza peel . i gave 4 starts instead of 5 because it showed that it was in stock and would ship with 2 day delivery . they actually were out of stock and it came a week after i really needed it .
0	i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation , motor power and style . i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange/return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds , even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs ! it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet
0	my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker , deliberately choosing one without a timer - the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong . . .right ? how can this company not even get the on-off button right ? ? ? it 's so cheap , when you push it , the `` lighted button '' just pushes right in , and does n't turn the coffeemaker off or on . why did n't we keep the box and receipt , so we could return it ? ? $ 20 down the drain do n't buy this
0	these sheets feel like sandpaper ... .they didnt fit my pillowtop either , thankfully , so i had to return the
