My son is now over 12lbs at 6 weeks and these shorts still look like capris on him. They do run on the big side but are cute 
made PERIOD!!. The leather on this shoe is glove soft and the sole is like a featherbed. I always enjoyed adidas tennis sneakers over the years but this is the only sneaker that allows me to serve and volley with comfort and agility as if I was floating across the court. THey just look cool to. I look forward to buying 2 more pairs as back ups and tryingthe stan smith II as well. JUst try these you will love em' 
Adidas traditional running shoe, suede, nice touch feeling. Great quality. It is quite green with less white (3 stripes). 
Thank you for these new line of offerings. Some us that prefer the convenience of online shopping due to busy schedules can now keep up with our fashion tastes without the inconvenience of finding time to go to the malls 
Okay, this cap is really stylish. But I think the sewing isn't quite finished. There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them. Not to mention the parts that weren't even sewed... no threads at all 
Great product. I got exactly what I wanted. I would give it 5 stars, but they didn't have the dark brown you see in the picture. Instead I got a Khaki color. I was very happy with their service and prompt reply. Just make sure they have the color you want. 
Product is great, perfect fit and cool style. The package arrived well on time 
Sweet cap if you like the style. It fits well and is well made. I love it 
Great style, quality products, and the prices are unbelievable! Finally, some who has a great variety of clothes and XL hat sizes... Andrew Christian is definitely at the top of my list 
Very stylish, this fashion is spreading at the moment. Don't forget to check the sizing chart first before you buy it. It's important. Cool cap 
This hat fits good. It's cool and fashionable. You can wear it anywhere and I got a lot of compliments 
The Vintage Fatigue Cap, is a great looking, great fitting (true to size) item. I was very happy when my cap arrived and saw that it looked better than I had imagined (even though the advertisement picture provided was an excellent reproduction). The cap came within the specified time and was packeged to arrive in excellent condition. Once again, I am very happy with a product that I ordered through Amazon and its vendor 
With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years 
i had purchased these kicks three years ago for work purpose. three years later i still wear them everyday. my job is fairly labor intensive, so they have really taken a beating. while they are still in decent shape and by far my most confortable shoe, i am ordering another pair or two from amazon. cant wait to get my new pair to start breaking them in 
The shoes are comfortable, the fit well and they seem to be standing up to wear and tear exceptionally well. Also, Amazon.com is really easy and convinient to shop from 
This suit was as expected. The lycra should hold up well in the pool 
I ordered this swim suit recently, it arrived very quick,(with regualr shipping) and fit me very well, it's a better quality product compare to the speedo I bought from Sam's, the only thing is they don't have size 34, I wear size 4 or size 6 cloth, so according to the chart, I suppose to order size 32, which is the largest available size, but I still feel it a little tie on me, maybe that 's the way professional swim wear suppose to be. Overall, it's a good product 
I like the suit and Lane4 shipped it to me in a timely manner. 
The collar stays work well and the shipping was on par. I will consider ordering from this company again 
The collar stays are great! They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts. The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly

My first pair of 10 eyelet DM boots lasted 8 years before the heel came apart from the sole. I'm on my 2nd pair now. I don't think they will last as long but you never know 
Some people scoff, they say $100 + for boots, no way, too expensive! I have been wearing DR's for 10 years, and nothing else. Why? Because nothing holds up like DR. Martins. Oddly my first pair ever fell apart after a couple of weeks, the stiching just fell out, but I exchanged them and have never had that problem since. The average pair last me 2 - 3 years of everyday, non-stop wear. I where them all year around, on the sales floor, wharehouse or office, and everywhere I go. They will not come apart! I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched, and when the soles start to wear smooth (14 - 18 months of 8 - 14hr / day wear, seven days a week!) and then I keep the old pair for another 14 - 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don't want to damage my good pair. I got married in DR. Martins, pollished with a new double-breasted suite! They look great with everything! Jeans, cargos, Dress clothes, shorts! I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago, they still look like brand new! These boots are forever 
These are some really good glasses. Plenty dark, full mirrored so you won't be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by. Shoot, for $18 you can't go wrong. I highly recommend them. And since I'm a pilot, it was obvious that I got a pair of these 
i have purchased 2 pairs from 80s purple, and i love them both they are very cool and durable for such thin framed glasses. the shipping is always ahead of schedule and they are very well packaged. i don't plan on buying sun glasses anywhere else 
thanks so much I bought these glasses and they had a minor defect. They responded to my email very quickly and I was send another pair within days. Would definetly do business with again, THANKS!! 
...Not to mention a great pair of sunglasses at a great price! Initially there was a problem with my order but Lu at 80s Purple was very helpful and once contact was made things were settled in a timely and orderly fashion. I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made. The glasses are great. Though thought of as some as "80's" "Retro" or what have you, Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt. Its Americana, Classic, and Cool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time. I love my new shades. They also come in a great hard-case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged. Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of "name brand" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier, more durable metal frames? Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money. I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support. Thanks 80s purple 
I bought a pair similar to these from a vender at a rest stop, and when those broke, I ordered these. They come in a nice bag, and they're metal, not plastic frames. You wouldn't know from looking at them, since they're so thin and light. The lenses are full mirrored, and scratch pretty easily (I hugged someone while they were hanging from my shirt collar, and there are nicks). But they are wicked cool looking, block plenty of sun and unless you look really closely, you can't see my eyes, which is the point. Goes great with "The Sisters of Mercy: Floodlands" CD : 
I am absolutely THRILLED with my aviator sunglasses! They look absolutely amazing and pricey! I cannot believe how sophisicated and polished it looks. And for just $14 dollars?! It's a total steal! And the shipping was super fast 
Best sunglasses ever!! I've received sooo many compliments and that i look like a movie star! and they are a reasonable price, and they look EXSPENSIVE!!! Best sunglasses ever! They are sooo comfortable, you'll forget your wearing them, and they look totally vintage. Trust me, buy them 
Best aviator sunnies I've ever owned. This is my second pair because my first pair got lost. I really like that these are 5.2 inches wide, as opposed to the standard 5 inches, so they can fit on my fat head and not squeeze my brain 
I like these cute pants, alot. They actually fit my "larger-than-average" baby well, even though most pants are far too long for his legs. The material isn't cheap and is nice and soft, washes well too. A good buy- I will buy more of these, especially considering BabyVision sent me coupons and gives a repeat-customer discount 
My 8 month old has his dad's build, tall and slim, so finding pants that are long enough and still stay up has been a challenge. These pants fit the bill. The material is ultra-comfy, and the colors go great with onesies from lots of different companies. They've also been through the wash numerous times (washed with Dreft), without fading or loosing their durability. A great product for the price. 
These are wonderful pants and for a good price too. My baby is wearing the 6-9 size and she is about 16 lbs and 26 inches at six months. The length is very good. I think she'll be in these at least another month or so. The material isn't cheap or light and they don't stretch out easily. The color of these match the colors in most baby clothing out there presently - which is very nice! I've bought a bunch of things from Baby Because through Amazon and some are really poor quality and others, like these, are wonderful, so don't judge them on their prices, some of their things are really nice. These pants are at least as good as the more expensive ones. I recommmend them 
I purchased the 0-3 months for my newborn. They fit him perfectly. He weighed 8 lbs. 6 oz. The pants are soft and match the onesies I bought for him too. It's hard to find this color of green 
I'm swimming every day therefore I needed something very durable, very chlorine resistant. This was my 4th swimsuit purchase in six months. Well, this swimsuit IS really chorine resistant, so far (3 months) it kept it's color, and shape. It is comfortable too, although it is hard to take it off when it is wet. 
I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4-6 months. They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water. This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool. Also, I'm usually a size 16, on the chunky side, but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14. Really glad I found it 
Great suit. Always loved speedos. This one has skiny straps for more comfort. Fits well and looks great. Also sizes don't say but a 38 is equivalent to a size 12 womens 
I bought this because it says the material would last longer than the nylon swim suits. Its less stretchy but okay for lap swim 
This suit was better than I expected. It flatters the figure and is one of the most comfortable suits I've ever worn. I feel great in it, and I don't feel like I have to tug at it every time I move. Great quality, great buy 
This suit hugs the contours of the body and doesn't get in the way of whatever water-oriented sport your involved in. It's flattering to the figure as well. The material feels durable and appears to stand-up to the pressures of being used daily in a chlorine environment. You can hardly go wrong with a Speedo 
I purchased these as a gift and was really impressed by how incredibly soft they are. (I wish they made women's shirts out of the same soft cotton.) Everyone I showed they too really liked the cute pink and yellow outfits. I am very pleased with this purchase 
These are good quality baby bodysuits, and very reasonably priced. Make sure you buy the size according to your baby's weight and height and not by the age posted. My 3 month old girl is wearing the 6-9 month size. They are a little big, but thats great because they will last longer. Warning: the medium green body suit is not color fast, and will end up looking like "camo" wear after you wash it. The other body suits in the green pack are color fast and will not fade quickly. It seems it is just the one green bodysuit that doesn't hold up well. I did not have any fading in the pink bodysuits. All in all I'd recommend these 
The quality of the bodysuits are very good. They are well made and good material. However they get three stars because of the sizing issue. My son is 10 months old and so I got him what I thought would be ones he could grow into...the 9-12 month, 27-34 lbs. This was not the case as soon as I washed them they shrunk to about the size of a 6-9 months onesie. The are good but if you order them order at least one to two sizes bigger than you think you will need 
I am thrilled to finally find socks that fit my toddler well and actually stay on her feet! These socks are great because they fit well, stay on, and have great non-skid bottoms that allow her to wear them without shoes and not slip all over the floor. And unlike most other non-skid socks these are still thin enough to wear with shoes. I love these socks and will be ordering more of them 
I bought the 18-24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90% of height and 40% of weight. The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly. But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing. And our daughter does not have fat ankles! I wish the ankle wasn't constructed so tightly, but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn.. 
Love these socks -- they're the first ones my boy didn't kick off with ease. I also like getting a color assortment. The fabric is sturdy and thick, the elastic is firm but not binding, and the quality is much higher than other kids' socks I've tried. And the price is right. However, be careful with the sizes. I got size 0-9 mo. for my 6-month-old, and they were too small. He's a big boy, but not that big. So I would order one size up from what you think you need. As long as you get the size that fits, you can't go wrong with these 
I love these sock...they don't shrink and cover my son's feet perfectly. Don't know why a newborn needs non-skidding socks but oh well 
We've tried several brands on our very active 8 month-old. These are the first ones that stay on. In addition, the colors (both blue sets) match most baby clothes, and they feel very comfy. The no-skid bottoms have been great on hard wood floors and plastic toys. 
At 6 1/2 months old my baby isn't walking yet, but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes. She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on. These stay on better than any we've tried. She can't pull them off easily. They are holding up very well in the wash and the colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The "non-slip" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says "Loveable Friends". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months. Overall these are very nice socks for a good price. I highly recommended them. 
My baby pulls off any shoes and socks that may be put on his feet. These stay on better than most. We got the 3 pairs in blue, yellow, and green. The "non-slip" part has cute printing on the bottom of the feet. Overall these socks are nice, nice, and nice, and the price is reasonable. 
I purchased these socks for my newborn baby girl because I used the same style for my son last year, and they are awesome! They fit right and feel comfortable (my son is picky about socks). 
This suit is a good quality suit. I've used Speedo brand swim suits for eleven years now, and I have found them to last well through recreactional swimming. Also, these suits are able to handle about two seasons of indoor competitive swimming, or more, depending on the chlorine levels and how well one takes care of the suit. So far, my new Quantum Splice has held up very well in the highly chlorinated pools in which I swim. I recommend this suit-- the price is so much less here than any I could find at a brick mortar store 
It was sent to me on time. And the product corresponds to my expectations. Thank you 
I read some reviews before I placed my order. Some complained about the smaller size. I found it's OK. The quality is good, at least worth the money 
I love it. It is exactly what I wanted and fits great. Arrived promptly too 
i have been a fan of this style since i was little and swam competitively. if you do not have a traditional petite body, this swimsuit is great! it has coverage in all the awkward areas that some of the other designs don't. i am 5'9 and well, not "skinny" and i was happy with the way it fit. if you are unsure of your size however, unless you are racing, it is best to order one size up. i went with a size up from what i wear in men's jeans and it seemed to work 
This is my 4th suit of the same style and make. It works well for me as I swim laps. It has good coverage and holds up pretty well. I swim about 4 times a week and I get about 4 to 5 months out of a suit due to the cholorine 
Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it and I would not buy another bathing suit from Amazon as it cost me money to send it back. 
Good quality lining in the front. I wish there is lining in the back too. Delivery is fast 
everything was perfect it was exactly what i expected. came in a timely fashion. would order from here again 
The warmest, most lasting, and most comfortable men's sock on the market! Excellant Price $$ 
I was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so I just ordered one from the grab bag. I figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit. Also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected 
The TYR grab bag suit I received was one I would have chosen, a great price for a great suit 
These are good quality Speedo suits - for competetive swimmers, Speedo suits last longer than Tyr suits. I generally order 2 at a time, get sent 2 different styles/colors (no solids so far). The only issue may be that you can't choose wide straps vs spaghetti straps 
If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through 
Champion Cotton rocks! Not only that they have variety in sizes and colours, but also good quality. This can make an excellent gift 
Great Quality Shirt and no itchy tag...very quick shipping from seller. I love the nice selection of colors and the shirt is not too tight and not too lose. Has a cool Champion logo 
hello' this item it's on of the best watch from guess it's nice and i advice you to buy i 
It's look like real gold watch and it's shine like a sun, I love this watc 
I like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white. gold one is look like really gold 
It's golden color is very remarkable ..It looks like real gold..wonderful piece to have 
My daughter needed black gym shorts for PE but all of the shorts I could find were shorter than my modest 13 year wanted to be seen in. These were a nice mid thigh length without looking like boys shorts. We were both happy with the quality and fabric. They did take a little long to ship 
Fast delivery and superior quality shirts.They do not shrink, are roomy sized and heavy weight..Not a cheapo imitation! Love them 
I ordered 2 extra large Charcoal Champion T Shirts for my husband. Only 2 because he is very picky about his T shirts and I wanted to make sure he liked them before I ordered a whole "thundering herd" of them. I told him I loved the champion items I have and he should try them. They washed and dried well - didn't shrink or fade. He absolutely loves them! So much in fact, he asked me to order more (Denim, Maroon Forest). I'll let you know if he likes those too. 
The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well. 
An I'm still wearing them. I went through 4 laces and it's still going strong... It is soo comfortable and a great work/casual shoe. Highly recommended!! 
I was just looking on-line for a new pair of docs. I love love this shoe. I'm probably getting on average - every 4 years get a new pair of docs. I basically just wear one shoe - and this one is it. After the first week - this shoe is worn to fit 'you' which is great and comfy. Another perk of docs. So I've gotten this particular shoe - 3 times! I gotta still give it raves... but my hubby wants me to get a different style. I won't get anything now but docs. Why a different style? Well - I just had a baby recently - and most of the leggings and stuff I wear - well - is black - and my docs have ALWAYS been brown. You know - to go with a great pair of khaki's! I wonder if he'll notice if I get the same shoe - but in black! ;- 
A difficult item to find in department stores. Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store. The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality. I purchased two and am very satisfied 
I ordered two of these one for me and my husband, we wore these in Disney World and you would be suprised at all the stuff we were able to put in them, I would suggest these to anyone who is looking for a great bag and what a bargain price! I know we will get many more uses out of these, they are really durable 
I just got mine. I am very happy with it. I ordered another one right now too!I cannot believe the price.I am very happy with my purchase 
I was supposed to get it by no later than March 2, It is now March 19 and still no bag! I had read another review that said they waited a long time for this item, but I figured since I ordered it Febuary 15, to be sure it would be by now! What have they got working in their shipping department a couple of monkeys that only work two days a week 
This is the kind of shirt which you get what you pay for. The material isn't that bad; well-made. The style is okay, looking smart but not geeky. It's good value though 
Two co-workers and I ordered these shirts. We are all extremely satisfied with them. These shirts are an excellent value. We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues 
I was wary about buying since the price was so low, but the shirt is quite good. I own many brands of dress shirts, some are expensive, some not. This is a nice shirt. It isn't see-thru like some of the other reviews said. It is just right for wearing under a suit in the warmer weather. You can go wrong at this price! 
As always, Amazon.com delivers right on time and great quality. I bought this shirt for my son-in-law who will be changing job positions and will require dress shirts and suits. He lives in another state, so it is great to use the bill to this address and ship to this address feature that Amazon.com offers. My son-in-law was very pleased with the shirt and service 
I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free 
I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me. Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin. Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back. But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised?? 
As the wife of the wearer, I find these shirt to be great and long-lasting. (and, though not their claim by any means, pretty darn stain-resistant, too!) The color does hold true throughout many washings. While the 'Wrinkle Free" portion isn't 100% true, they do come out of the dryer looking better than most, and after a light starch and ironing, stay quite crisp during a day's wearing. The manufacturing quality, in my experience, is also great -- I've never had a problem with a loose seam or button. I also love that Van Heusen offers a shirt in a size 18 neck with a 32/33 sleeve. My husband is an average-size guy with a greater-than-average neck, so finding this 18-32/33 combo is dang near impossible in other brands. Thanks, Van Heusen 
I bought the breast petals so that I wouldn't have to worry on my wedding day. I did not want to wear a bra because of the style of dress I had. This product was great. It was easy to apply and did the job. They came off easily at the end of the night. I wore them for about 8 hours and had no problems at all. I would highly recommend them to anyone 
I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open nearly to the waist, and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little, nobody would be able to see anything. The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin, so they were perfect. They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold. The best part was, they didn't feel weird at all 
I started wearing these shoes when I was 19. Five years later, I've gone through two pairs (about to buy my third), but they've been my one and only pair of shoes. I just haven't had the desire to wear anything else. I've worn them for nearly 12 hours a day, every single day, year-round, working at a job during the day that requires constant movement, and then walking around the city at night. You can't really tell by looking at them that they've been literally everywhere with me. They could use a bit of a polish, but other than that, nothing's worn down. I suppose if I wore more shoes, I would only need one pair of these, and they'd last longer. But thats not stopping me. 
I had blisters and painful feet for 3 weeks until these shoes broke in. If you buy these, make sure you get band aids too 
I bought my first pair of Doc's when I was 16. After joining the military, traveling to nearly 50 different countries, in sleet, snow, and boiling deserts in the Middle East, this same pair of shoes still look great today, 20 years later, albeit scuffed up. Indeed, last week I had a casual business meeting; with a little spit, elbow grease, and an old towel I used to dry off my dog, they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki's. They're exceptionally comfortable, timeless, and well worth the price. How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own? That's like what, $5/yr? The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair -- in black. They're that good, like an old friend, reliable, stylish, and right there with you to conquer life's many challenges. I highly recommend them. -josef 
These shoes really do wear like iron, and are superbly comfortable--once they are broken in. The sizing takes some getting used to. I recommend buying (or at least trying on) Dr. Martens in a store the first time, to find out one's size in the British system. My USA size is 10D. Yet, the Dr. Martens that works for me is UK 10/USA 11. Go figure. When the first pair of these I got began to look shabby, I simply polished it with brown shoe polish. That pair of shoes is still fine, after being worn more days than any shoes I have ever had 
I like these cute pants, alot. They actually fit my "larger-than-average" baby well, even though most pants are far too long for his legs. The material isn't cheap and is nice and soft, washes well too. A good buy- I will buy more of these, especially considering BabyVision sent me coupons and gives a repeat-customer discount 
My 8 month old has his dad's build, tall and slim, so finding pants that are long enough and still stay up has been a challenge. These pants fit the bill. The material is ultra-comfy, and the colors go great with onesies from lots of different companies. They've also been through the wash numerous times (washed with Dreft), without fading or loosing their durability. A great product for the price. 
These are wonderful pants and for a good price too. My baby is wearing the 6-9 size and she is about 16 lbs and 26 inches at six months. The length is very good. I think she'll be in these at least another month or so. The material isn't cheap or light and they don't stretch out easily. The color of these match the colors in most baby clothing out there presently - which is very nice! I've bought a bunch of things from Baby Because through Amazon and some are really poor quality and others, like these, are wonderful, so don't judge them on their prices, some of their things are really nice. These pants are at least as good as the more expensive ones. I recommmend them 
I purchased the 0-3 months for my newborn. They fit him perfectly. He weighed 8 lbs. 6 oz. The pants are soft and match the onesies I bought for him too. It's hard to find this color of green 
I'm swimming every day therefore I needed something very durable, very chlorine resistant. This was my 4th swimsuit purchase in six months. Well, this swimsuit IS really chorine resistant, so far (3 months) it kept it's color, and shape. It is comfortable too, although it is hard to take it off when it is wet. 
I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4-6 months. They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water. This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool. Also, I'm usually a size 16, on the chunky side, but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14. Really glad I found it 
Great suit. Always loved speedos. This one has skiny straps for more comfort. Fits well and looks great. Also sizes don't say but a 38 is equivalent to a size 12 womens 
I bought this because it says the material would last longer than the nylon swim suits. Its less stretchy but okay for lap swim 
This suit was better than I expected. It flatters the figure and is one of the most comfortable suits I've ever worn. I feel great in it, and I don't feel like I have to tug at it every time I move. Great quality, great buy

The material feels durable and appears to stand-up to the pressures of being used daily in a chlorine environment. You can hardly go wrong with a Speedo 
I purchased these as a gift and was really impressed by how incredibly soft they are. (I wish they made women's shirts out of the same soft cotton.) Everyone I showed they too really liked the cute pink and yellow outfits. I am very pleased with this purchase 
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones. Fits my boy just right 
These are good quality baby bodysuits, and very reasonably priced. Make sure you buy the size according to your baby's weight and height and not by the age posted. My 3 month old girl is wearing the 6-9 month size. They are a little big, but thats great because they will last longer. Warning: the medium green body suit is not color fast, and will end up looking like "camo" wear after you wash it. The other body suits in the green pack are color fast and will not fade quickly. It seems it is just the one green bodysuit that doesn't hold up well. I did not have any fading in the pink bodysuits. All in all I'd recommend these 
Very nice basic clothing. I think the size is fine. I really like being able to find these shades of green, though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color. This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens 
The quality of the bodysuits are very good. They are well made and good material. However they get three stars because of the sizing issue. My son is 10 months old and so I got him what I thought would be ones he could grow into...the 9-12 month, 27-34 lbs. This was not the case as soon as I washed them they shrunk to about the size of a 6-9 months onesie. The are good but if you order them order at least one to two sizes bigger than you think you will need 
I am thrilled to finally find socks that fit my toddler well and actually stay on her feet! These socks are great because they fit well, stay on, and have great non-skid bottoms that allow her to wear them without shoes and not slip all over the floor. And unlike most other non-skid socks these are still thin enough to wear with shoes. I love these socks and will be ordering more of them 
I bought the 18-24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90% of height and 40% of weight. The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly. But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing. And our daughter does not have fat ankles! I wish the ankle wasn't constructed so tightly, but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn.. 
Love these socks -- they're the first ones my boy didn't kick off with ease. I also like getting a color assortment. The fabric is sturdy and thick, the elastic is firm but not binding, and the quality is much higher than other kids' socks I've tried. And the price is right. However, be careful with the sizes. I got size 0-9 mo. for my 6-month-old, and they were too small. He's a big boy, but not that big. So I would order one size up from what you think you need. As long as you get the size that fits, you can't go wrong with these 
I love these sock...they don't shrink and cover my son's feet perfectly. Don't know why a newborn needs non-skidding socks but oh well 
We've tried several brands on our very active 8 month-old. These are the first ones that stay on. In addition, the colors (both blue sets) match most baby clothes, and they feel very comfy. The no-skid bottoms have been great on hard wood floors and plastic toys. 
At 6 1/2 months old my baby isn't walking yet, but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes. She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on. These stay on better than any we've tried. She can't pull them off easily. They are holding up very well in the wash and the colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The "non-slip" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says "Loveable Friends". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months. Overall these are very nice socks for a good price. I highly recommended them. 
My baby pulls off any shoes and socks that may be put on his feet. These stay on better than most. We got the 3 pairs in blue, yellow, and green. The "non-slip" part has cute printing on the bottom of the feet. Overall these socks are nice, nice, and nice, and the price is reasonable. 
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. : 
I purchased these socks for my newborn baby girl because I used the same style for my son last year, and they are awesome! They fit right and feel comfortable (my son is picky about socks). 
This suit is a good quality suit. I've used Speedo brand swim suits for eleven years now, and I have found them to last well through recreactional swimming. Also, these suits are able to handle about two seasons of indoor competitive swimming, or more, depending on the chlorine levels and how well one takes care of the suit. So far, my new Quantum Splice has held up very well in the highly chlorinated pools in which I swim. I recommend this suit-- the price is so much less here than any I could find at a brick mortar store 
It was sent to me on time. And the product corresponds to my expectations. Thank you 
I read some reviews before I placed my order. Some complained about the smaller size. I found it's OK. The quality is good, at least worth the money 
I love it. It is exactly what I wanted and fits great. Arrived promptly too 
i have been a fan of this style since i was little and swam competitively. if you do not have a traditional petite body, this swimsuit is great! it has coverage in all the awkward areas that some of the other designs don't. i am 5'9 and well, not "skinny" and i was happy with the way it fit. if you are unsure of your size however, unless you are racing, it is best to order one size up. i went with a size up from what i wear in men's jeans and it seemed to work 
This is my 4th suit of the same style and make. It works well for me as I swim laps. It has good coverage and holds up pretty well. I swim about 4 times a week and I get about 4 to 5 months out of a suit due to the cholorine 
Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it and I would not buy another bathing suit from Amazon as it cost me money to send it back. 
Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit. I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied. This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get. Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores. Thanks!! 
Good quality lining in the front. I wish there is lining in the back too. Delivery is fast 
everything was perfect it was exactly what i expected. came in a timely fashion. would order from here again 
The warmest, most lasting, and most comfortable men's sock on the market! Excellant Price $$ 
Your company was a pleasure to work with- thanks! I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered 
The TYR grab bag suit I received was one I would have chosen, a great price for a great suit 
My son is now over 12lbs at 6 weeks and these shorts still look like capris on him. They do run on the big side but are cute 
These are good quality Speedo suits - for competetive swimmers, Speedo suits last longer than Tyr suits. I generally order 2 at a time, get sent 2 different styles/colors (no solids so far). The only issue may be that you can't choose wide straps vs spaghetti straps 
Champion Cotton rocks! Not only that they have variety in sizes and colours, but also good quality. This can make an excellent gift 
Great Quality Shirt and no itchy tag...very quick shipping from seller. I love the nice selection of colors and the shirt is not too tight and not too lose. Has a cool Champion logo 
hello' this item it's on of the best watch from guess it's nice and i advice you to buy i 
It's look like real gold watch and it's shine like a sun, I love this watc 
I like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white. gold one is look like really gold 
My daughter needed black gym shorts for PE but all of the shorts I could find were shorter than my modest 13 year wanted to be seen in. These were a nice mid thigh length without looking like boys shorts. We were both happy with the quality and fabric. They did take a little long to ship 
i had purchased these kicks three years ago for work purpose. three years later i still wear them everyday. my job is fairly labor intensive, so they have really taken a beating. while they are still in decent shape and by far my most confortable shoe, i am ordering another pair or two from amazon. cant wait to get my new pair to start breaking them in 
GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS 
The shoes are comfortable, the fit well and they seem to be standing up to wear and tear exceptionally well. Also, Amazon.com is really easy and convinient to shop from 
This suit was as expected. The lycra should hold up well in the pool 
I ordered this swim suit recently, it arrived very quick,(with regualr shipping) and fit me very well, it's a better quality product compare to the speedo I bought from Sam's, the only thing is they don't have size 34, I wear size 4 or size 6 cloth, so according to the chart, I suppose to order size 32, which is the largest available size, but I still feel it a little tie on me, maybe that 's the way professional swim wear suppose to be. Overall, it's a good product 
I like the suit and Lane4 shipped it to me in a timely manner. 
I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small "note book" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product 
very portable. great picture. easy to operate. all the accessories you need. great sound. playes dvd's from sony camcorder. very happy with the system. am looking forward to using this camping and on vacation. 
Fast delivery and superior quality shirts.They do not shrink, are roomy sized and heavy weight..Not a cheapo imitation! Love them 
I ordered 2 extra large Charcoal Champion T Shirts for my husband. Only 2 because he is very picky about his T shirts and I wanted to make sure he liked them before I ordered a whole "thundering herd" of them. I told him I loved the champion items I have and he should try them. They washed and dried well - didn't shrink or fade. He absolutely loves them! So much in fact, he asked me to order more (Denim, Maroon Forest). I'll let you know if he likes those too. 
The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well. 
An I'm still wearing them. I went through 4 laces and it's still going strong... It is soo comfortable and a great work/casual shoe. Highly recommended!! 
I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that. I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure! These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat). Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen. 
I was just looking on-line for a new pair of docs. I love love this shoe. I'm probably getting on average - every 4 years get a new pair of docs. I basically just wear one shoe - and this one is it. After the first week - this shoe is worn to fit 'you' which is great and comfy. Another perk of docs. So I've gotten this particular shoe - 3 times! I gotta still give it raves... but my hubby wants me to get a different style. I won't get anything now but docs. Why a different style? Well - I just had a baby recently - and most of the leggings and stuff I wear - well - is black - and my docs have ALWAYS been brown. You know - to go with a great pair of khaki's! I wonder if he'll notice if I get the same shoe - but in black! ;- 
made PERIOD!!. The leather on this shoe is glove soft and the sole is like a featherbed. I always enjoyed adidas tennis sneakers over the years but this is the only sneaker that allows me to serve and volley with comfort and agility as if I was floating across the court. THey just look cool to. I look forward to buying 2 more pairs as back ups and tryingthe stan smith II as well. JUst try these you will love em' 
Thank you for these new line of offerings. Some us that prefer the convenience of online shopping due to busy schedules can now keep up with our fashion tastes without the inconvenience of finding time to go to the malls 
I ordered two of these one for me and my husband, we wore these in Disney World and you would be suprised at all the stuff we were able to put in them, I would suggest these to anyone who is looking for a great bag and what a bargain price! I know we will get many more uses out of these, they are really durable 
I just got mine. I am very happy with it. I ordered another one right now too!I cannot believe the price.I am very happy with my purchase 
I was supposed to get it by no later than March 2, It is now March 19 and still no bag! I had read another review that said they waited a long time for this item, but I figured since I ordered it Febuary 15, to be sure it would be by now! What have they got working in their shipping department a couple of monkeys that only work two days a week 
I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days. The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired. While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand 
The collar stays work well and the shipping was on par. I will consider ordering from this company again 
The collar stays are great! They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts. The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly

This is the kind of shirt which you get what you pay for. The material isn't that bad; well-made. The style is okay, looking smart but not geeky. It's good value though 
Two co-workers and I ordered these shirts. We are all extremely satisfied with them. These shirts are an excellent value. We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues 
I was wary about buying since the price was so low, but the shirt is quite good. I own many brands of dress shirts, some are expensive, some not. This is a nice shirt. It isn't see-thru like some of the other reviews said. It is just right for wearing under a suit in the warmer weather. You can go wrong at this price! 
As always, Amazon.com delivers right on time and great quality. I bought this shirt for my son-in-law who will be changing job positions and will require dress shirts and suits. He lives in another state, so it is great to use the bill to this address and ship to this address feature that Amazon.com offers. My son-in-law was very pleased with the shirt and service 
Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say 
The shirts are what I had asked for. They are sturdy and well made. I would buy more if I needed more. Well worth the money spen 
These are a great pair of shoes, feel good, look good and very lightweight. That is why I am buying a second pai 
Adidas traditional running shoe, suede, nice touch feeling. Great quality. It is quite green with less white (3 stripes). 
As the wife of the wearer, I find these shirt to be great and long-lasting. (and, though not their claim by any means, pretty darn stain-resistant, too!) The color does hold true throughout many washings. While the 'Wrinkle Free" portion isn't 100% true, they do come out of the dryer looking better than most, and after a light starch and ironing, stay quite crisp during a day's wearing. The manufacturing quality, in my experience, is also great -- I've never had a problem with a loose seam or button. I also love that Van Heusen offers a shirt in a size 18 neck with a 32/33 sleeve. My husband is an average-size guy with a greater-than-average neck, so finding this 18-32/33 combo is dang near impossible in other brands. Thanks, Van Heusen 
Great product. I got exactly what I wanted. I would give it 5 stars, but they didn't have the dark brown you see in the picture. Instead I got a Khaki color. I was very happy with their service and prompt reply. Just make sure they have the color you want. 
Product is great, perfect fit and cool style. The package arrived well on time 
Sweet cap if you like the style. It fits well and is well made. I love it 
Great style, quality products, and the prices are unbelievable! Finally, some who has a great variety of clothes and XL hat sizes... Andrew Christian is definitely at the top of my list 
Very stylish, this fashion is spreading at the moment. Don't forget to check the sizing chart first before you buy it. It's important. Cool cap 
This hat fits good. It's cool and fashionable. You can wear it anywhere and I got a lot of compliments 
The Vintage Fatigue Cap, is a great looking, great fitting (true to size) item. I was very happy when my cap arrived and saw that it looked better than I had imagined (even though the advertisement picture provided was an excellent reproduction). The cap came within the specified time and was packeged to arrive in excellent condition. Once again, I am very happy with a product that I ordered through Amazon and its vendor 
I bought the breast petals so that I wouldn't have to worry on my wedding day. I did not want to wear a bra because of the style of dress I had. This product was great. It was easy to apply and did the job. They came off easily at the end of the night. I wore them for about 8 hours and had no problems at all. I would highly recommend them to anyone 
I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock 
My first pair of 10 eyelet DM boots lasted 8 years before the heel came apart from the sole. I'm on my 2nd pair now. I don't think they will last as long but you never know 
Some people scoff, they say $100 + for boots, no way, too expensive! I have been wearing DR's for 10 years, and nothing else. Why? Because nothing holds up like DR. Martins. Oddly my first pair ever fell apart after a couple of weeks, the stiching just fell out, but I exchanged them and have never had that problem since. The average pair last me 2 - 3 years of everyday, non-stop wear. I where them all year around, on the sales floor, wharehouse or office, and everywhere I go. They will not come apart! I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched, and when the soles start to wear smooth (14 - 18 months of 8 - 14hr / day wear, seven days a week!) and then I keep the old pair for another 14 - 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don't want to damage my good pair. I got married in DR. Martins, pollished with a new double-breasted suite! They look great with everything! Jeans, cargos, Dress clothes, shorts! I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago, they still look like brand new! These boots are forever 
i have purchased 2 pairs from 80s purple, and i love them both they are very cool and durable for such thin framed glasses. the shipping is always ahead of schedule and they are very well packaged. i don't plan on buying sun glasses anywhere else 
thanks so much I bought these glasses and they had a minor defect. They responded to my email very quickly and I was send another pair within days. Would definetly do business with again, THANKS!! 
...Not to mention a great pair of sunglasses at a great price! Initially there was a problem with my order but Lu at 80s Purple was very helpful and once contact was made things were settled in a timely and orderly fashion. I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made. The glasses are great. Though thought of as some as "80's" "Retro" or what have you, Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt. Its Americana, Classic, and Cool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time. I love my new shades. They also come in a great hard-case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged. Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of "name brand" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier, more durable metal frames? Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money. I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support. Thanks 80s purple 
I bought a pair similar to these from a vender at a rest stop, and when those broke, I ordered these. They come in a nice bag, and they're metal, not plastic frames. You wouldn't know from looking at them, since they're so thin and light. The lenses are full mirrored, and scratch pretty easily (I hugged someone while they were hanging from my shirt collar, and there are nicks). But they are wicked cool looking, block plenty of sun and unless you look really closely, you can't see my eyes, which is the point. Goes great with "The Sisters of Mercy: Floodlands" CD : 
I am absolutely THRILLED with my aviator sunglasses! They look absolutely amazing and pricey! I cannot believe how sophisicated and polished it looks. And for just $14 dollars?! It's a total steal! And the shipping was super fast 
These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool.. 
Best sunglasses ever!! I've received sooo many compliments and that i look like a movie star! and they are a reasonable price, and they look EXSPENSIVE!!! Best sunglasses ever! They are sooo comfortable, you'll forget your wearing them, and they look totally vintage. Trust me, buy them 
Best aviator sunnies I've ever owned. This is my second pair because my first pair got lost. I really like that these are 5.2 inches wide, as opposed to the standard 5 inches, so they can fit on my fat head and not squeeze my brain 
I started wearing these shoes when I was 19. Five years later, I've gone through two pairs (about to buy my third), but they've been my one and only pair of shoes. I just haven't had the desire to wear anything else. I've worn them for nearly 12 hours a day, every single day, year-round, working at a job during the day that requires constant movement, and then walking around the city at night. You can't really tell by looking at them that they've been literally everywhere with me. They could use a bit of a polish, but other than that, nothing's worn down. I suppose if I wore more shoes, I would only need one pair of these, and they'd last longer. But thats not stopping me. 
I had blisters and painful feet for 3 weeks until these shoes broke in. If you buy these, make sure you get band aids too 
I bought my first pair of Doc's when I was 16. After joining the military, traveling to nearly 50 different countries, in sleet, snow, and boiling deserts in the Middle East, this same pair of shoes still look great today, 20 years later, albeit scuffed up. Indeed, last week I had a casual business meeting; with a little spit, elbow grease, and an old towel I used to dry off my dog, they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki's. They're exceptionally comfortable, timeless, and well worth the price. How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own? That's like what, $5/yr? The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair -- in black. They're that good, like an old friend, reliable, stylish, and right there with you to conquer life's many challenges. I highly recommend them. -josef 
These shoes really do wear like iron, and are superbly comfortable--once they are broken in. The sizing takes some getting used to. I recommend buying (or at least trying on) Dr. Martens in a store the first time, to find out one's size in the British system. My USA size is 10D. Yet, the Dr. Martens that works for me is UK 10/USA 11. Go figure. When the first pair of these I got began to look shabby, I simply polished it with brown shoe polish. That pair of shoes is still fine, after being worn more days than any shoes I have ever had 
These are so adorable, my daughter loves them and wears them all the time 
I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY LITTLE GIRL, SHE LOVES THEM. SHE GET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM. QUALITY IS GREAT AND THEY TEND TO RUN BIG.. 
My daughter loved her new boots from Santa! I was concerned when I was sent a size 13.5 instead of a 3.5 BUT all worked out - the exchange was speedy and I had the correct size boots within 2 days! That was awesome. We recently had a "chilly" couple days here in South Florida and my daughter was able to wear her Snuggy Boots to school 
These shoes are very comfortable for walking or running on both pavement and trails. They have much better traction than the last pair of trail runners I had, even on wet, slightly muddy pavement. The aggressive lugs in the sole do tend to hold mud, however, so I have to check them before I come into the house. The shoes seem to run a bit wider than the other NB shoes that I have worn, so I need to wear thick socks with them even with my wide feet. Overall, I am happy with the shoes. 
I ordered this blouse for my daughter, because she has to wear oxford blouses at work. She said she was very pleased with the blouse--just didn't like ironing. However, oxford blouses are expensive, and this is a great bargain. Today, I ordered 3 more for her 
These shoes are great. If you have any problems with your feet, New Balance is the way to go. But what was most impressive about this order was how quickly I received them. I got them within a day or two. I was very impressed 
My transaction was as smooth as it could have been. The product is of fine quality. The company was prompt and informing 
Excellent shoe, excellent company. You can do no better than this and prices are exceptional. Highly recommend 
Oh my goodness... I don't know what I would do without my Spanx! I will never wear a pair of work slacks without them. A nice pair of trousers will have some polyester involved in it... well this stuff clings to bulges and panty lines. Spanx gets rid of VPL and smoothes out those little areas we don't like to mention. So fabrics that have a little more flow to them, will actually flow and not cling! You will look more neat and tidy in your clothes and you might even look a few pounds lighter. They are so comfortable and because it is thin nylon material, you can wear them during the warm summer months. Don't be fooled by imitations! Spanx brand is the only one you want when it comes to quality and doing what it promises! I recommend the medium control even if you have a little bit of tummy to hide (it still works well on me). The super tends to be a little tighter so size up if you are going to get them 
We received our item well within the time specified. It was exactly what we ordered. We are very happy with this service and will use it again 
I have 4 pair and will buy more. I love the fit and they are so comfortable to wear. 
I found myself carrying several bags to transport all my items even though I had a really nice large leather bag. This bag takes care of the problem of everything being thrown in together. The compartments are roomy with space enough for everything, including lunch! I am contemplating getting this bag in red, also! Everyone who sees it, wants it 
this bag is awesome. it's not big enough to use as a suitcase, but for women, carrying a laptop bag and a purse can be a hassle. this eliminates that problem because it fits your laptop and anything else you could feasibly need to carry with you! i just put my purse right in there. the only problem is that i have a 15" laptop, which fits in the bag, but the velcro strap that holds the laptop in place barely fits over it. it does though, but it would be good if that were a little longer to hold it more securely. also, for those with a laptop bigger than 15" this bag is not for you. i also love the outer pocket... perfect for your boarding pass and other travel documents you may have to access several times and quickly 
It was hard to find a tote for my wife's 18" laptop. I sent 3 back that said they worked- but didn't 
The color is great, its roomy enough to carry everything. But that can also be a problem -- its like a overnight case. So, for everyday things, like back and forth to the office with the laptop it might be a little too big 
I have been looking for a new wallet to replace the dinosaur I currently have. My biggest issue is that I have several cards (hard and soft) that I have stuffed everywhere which made my old wallet big and unwieldy. You could say it would be useful as a weapon it was so big. It would take me forever to find things. The Kenneth Cole wallet was just what I needed. It has several pockets and since I hardly ever carry cash I can use the extra space for receipts and the soft cards. Much slimmer and lighter to carry. The change purse part is small but isn't a problem for me since I don't carry that much change anyway. Since change is bulky by nature, I would prefer a separate change purse anyway. The leather is very smooth and I love the avocado color--makes it stand out in the black hole that is my purse 
This is a good undecorated leotard. I am fussy about such things as snugness, fabric surface, and stitching with new clothing, especially exercise and dance attire. Everything is fine. Time will tell how well it holds up to wearing and the laundry 
The Charles David strike high heel sling is stylish and sophisticated. It's an update of a classic that will never go in the back of the closet. The fit is true to size and is surprisingly comfortable. I intend to wear this for work and for going out. I couldn't be happier with this purchase 
This is essentially the Standard #10 Bike Jock in Grey. You've worn this jock for years, and this one is no different except for the color. I wore it today to the gym, it fit great in the pouch holding everything in place, the wide 3 inch waistband and thick 1 inch straps (I prefer wider leg straps as they don't roll under your cheeks) felt great and I'll be using it again in the future. The grey color is a nice, masculine change if you get tired of white or black jocks. If you want a good, sturdy, traditional jock this is it 
This is the real thing. Not only is it light and easy to wash, it holds your package in place like a jock is supposed to. This is a real man's jock strap 
NineWest certainly know how to make great shoes for not that high price. Thank You NineWes 
Nine West shoes are always a hit with me. They are true to size, fit perfectly. The tread on the bottom of the boot is great for winter weather walking. These boots look great with jeans 
Cheap and entertaining, this bag is a hit at work. We were surfing the internet one night and decided he would be a great greeter for our guests. Everyone loves him, I higly recommend 
great jacket, lightweight with a nice waxy coating to protect against rai 
I was leery of trying a mule-type sneaker, wondering if it would would slap my heel with a "thwak!" every time I took a step. Still, I'm the kind of person who'll go shoeless rather than tie laces. The Travel Time Mule is very comfortable, and I tested my pair walking miles upon miles at a local attraction. My feet sit securely in them and they're just so easy to take on and off. My only complaint is that there is no ventilation to the shoe. The top, which could easily provide a little air if differently constructed, is solid so that by day's end your feet will definitely be on the warm side. However, the comfort and ease these shows provide make that only a moderate inconvenience 
Got these as a gift for my mom for Christmas. She wanted a shoe to put by the front door so she could go out and get the paper in the morning, get the mail, etc. These shoes are perfect, easy to slip on and off and very comfortable. They are a little narrow so that is why i am givng them 4 stars, but other than that they are wonderful 
Not really, but they should be. Very comfortable 
Nice construction and style. Very comfortable. Perfect for working out or lounging if you're lazy 
I love my Vaneli Shoes. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Besides being very stylish, they are "way" comfortable! 
I was surprise by the narrowness of the pants but please with the light thickness of the material. It does keep you warm 
Excellent! Fast Ship, best price, new ite 
I love the variety of neon colors Amazon offers for the passport holder. Its easy to find in my bag when I'm at the customs counter or on the airplane 
I like the service and product. The company is considerate enough to put on a size chart for people who are confused about which size of gloves to pick from online stores. This becomes very handy. The glove itself is soft and warm. It will be an ideal gift for my dad's birthday in June, although he won't be wearing it until this winter. :) 
I bought these for my Dad and they are lovely and warm and he really seemed to apreciate them a lot 
I purchased a bathing suit using the sizing chart that the seller provided and it proved to be very inaccurate. I purchased a size small based on the chart and it doesn't come close to fitting. The suit is not exchangeable (since it is sold by a California merchant). Now I am out of pocket and the suit does not fit. I do not recommend this merchant to others 
I had the same problem about it not really being true to size. I'm small, 5'0 and about 100lbs, but when I put the small on, it was tight. I don't have much weight to lose, so I guess I'll be spending more time in the gym toneing up. I've gotten lots of compliments on it though 
The shorts I purchased were very light weight was was an excellent quality considering the heat. These shorts come in even sizes up to 42'. These shorts have elastic on each side which lets the shorts expand during the day, particularly when you are working and your pockets get full or your work belt gets added weight. These shorts were the most excellent buy of this type that I have ever made 
I have been very pleased with this item. It is well made and is comfortable 
Easy and convenient! Quick delivery and walah!!!!!Thanks Amazon for offering so many products. 
My son needed this in a hurry because his team was in the regions games and the weather changed quickly. He was warm and did not freeze with this cold gear. It was also the perfect color to match his uniform 
Not mentioned in the description of this product is how it only fits children 
I have really enjoyed the Biker style shoe. They are light but yet supportive enough. Especially enjoy the velcro closers..........don't worry about tripping over untied laces 
I took this dark blue sleep tee on a 10 day vacation, crumpled it in my luggage, spilled coffee on it, all the usual errors. It always looked and, more importantly, FELT great. It didn't ride up, was a nice dark color so it didn't show any dirt from falling on the bathroom floors of hotels, and was always comfortable. Not cheap but it really took a beating from travel and still felt great. I'll enjoy it now at home 
I bought two in different colors and love them. They are soft but sturdy and practical. They are easy to wash, with plenty of fabric to cozy up around your legs and a slit side to make movement easy. The vee neck is flattering. You can't go wrong with the excellent price, either 
It reminds me of a cheap imitation patch that my grandmother would sow onto a hat. I have several MLB hats and this isn't anywhere near the same quality 
These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. I was worried after reading previous customer reviews that these shoes run small/narrow because I have a wide foot. However, they fit perfectly. The straps are feminine and the gold sole provides just enough glitz. And with a retail price of $105, how can you beat this great deal? 
These shoes are more of a 5 than a 6. They are labeled as 6M but I even had an aunt who is 5½ try them on and they were tight on her 
This short is minimalistic. Just what you need if you are doing Yoga. Grips the leg, does not show what you do not what to show. I use black underpants under them, as they are a bit too minimalistic without. I think they are a bit overpriced, but I have not found as good a short for less (low demand?) 
The Mantra short by Prana is my favorite short for yoga. I practice Ashtanga, which is a very active form of yoga, so my body is twisting and turning a lot. The Mantra short is a great length - not too short, but not too long. It fits my leg well, too - it hugs it without being too ungodly tight. I recommend it 
The EasyGo Travel Pillow with Pouch (Black) is functional, comfortable, and had timely shipping. It also makes a nice travel gift. 
Though maybe just a bit less comfortable as the new pre-filled travel pillow, this is much more practical, especially if you're taking multiple ones for different family members. We traveled to Europe (3 planes) with a 6 1/2 year old and he used it too, just with a little less inflation. It is comforatble, durable, inexpensive and transports easy in a purse or little side pocket of a carry-on 
This coat is worth the money. I love it. It is actually very warm as well 
I will buy one at this time. Please put the shoes in a small box because when they put on in a big packing that is very expensive for my. You complete measures of security for the articles but sometimes oneself articulates it is wrapped up different (in small or very big packings)  I thank if it is possible to put it in a single very small box so that I pay less for the shipment (I transfer to my country) because there are very big differences of money.  thank you  MORAIMA MENDOZA   
I love the shoes, but I suffer with an arch problem and sometimes they hurt my feet, but I suffer through it. I do love the style 
This is the second pair of these i bought for my wife. She loves them. Fit is great and they look good. 
These are stretchy and soft. (It's a little hard getting used to how boyshorts are so high up in the back, but once used to it, it's fine). They're really well priced and they do run small like the merchant says. We will be buying more 
I had to return them because of wrong size. I would like to know if you have them at a size 40? Please let me know or tell me who I can contact to re-order the item. Thank 
I just received these today, and absolutely love them. They're small,very lightweight,and extremely comfortable. They fit perfectly due to the spandex, but doesn't fit so tight as to cause any discomfort. They also aren't too revealing, which is what I was afraid of before I tried them on. I have them in black, so I can't speak for the white pair, but I'd definitely consider these for your next pair. 
I purchased this thinking it would be a bona fide swim trunk. After all, the word "trunk" is in its description. It ends up being an athletic support brief in a box cut; hardly something a serious swimmer would think of wearing. 
These square cut Puma trunks will get you hot looks at the beach if you have a good physique. Very comfortable and way better tan lines than board shorts. Puma logo is big enough to be noticed and will definitely garner comments especially on a beach full O label ho's LOL. Have fun, be happy and don't be a hater. 
These products are worth every penny, well made, deliciously comfortable, easily laundered. They iron well and keep their shape. They last for years and there is just something so comfortingly old fashoined about this brand and it's reliabilty 
These bras are PERFECT! I hand wash mine, and they last a long time. This bra does keep the ladies in the right position without any arm-going-numb discomfort.I've tried many bras in my lifetime to try to get that semi-sleazy cleavage in the right position and not have my shoulders be cut-off from the weight on the straps. There you go, Bali Seductive Curves Bras are practically bullet-proof, and are comfy to boot! If I was rich I'd buy stock 
This bra fits me properly, and I am fastidious about how I wash and store my lingere. Still, the cups gave up their sleekness and I can't wear it with a t-shirt or other close-fitting tops 
These shoes look fantastic on! They are very high heels, so my suggestion is to only wear them for dinner and you'll be comfortable. Worth the price. 
This comfortable, under price, beautiful shoes are the best buy I had in months. And believe me, I buy a lot of shoes! From Prada to Christian Louboutin. The design it's original, innovative and "fashionista". Why are they so cheap? I have no idea. 
I loved these slippers except that the black dye came on on me feet and am having a hard time getting the dye off. I suggest getting the natural ones. They're a great slipper otherwise. Thanks 
Loved these! Comfortable and the fit is great if you go down a size you normally wea 
I purchased these for my 12 year old daughter. They are beutiful and she loves them. She wears them as shoes outside. At first I was so worried about them getting ruined and dirty, but they are very hardy and wipe clean very easily. We are both very happy with the purchase 
Fantastic! I wear a 7.5 shoe (maybe 8 sometimes), yet I fit perfectly into a size 7 Coquette 
Super comfortable. Super Warm. I only own 3 pairs, but it's still early in the season 
This was my very first pair of Tsubo shoes. I have since purchased many more. I fell in love with these first site and first try on. They simply feel fabulous on my feet, and get many compliments from others. These shoes are the bomb 
I [heart] tsubo shoes. they are always comfortable, and last. And I know they always fit. My first pair, at least 3 years old, finally developed a crack in the sole, but are otherwise fine. Tsubos and Blundstones. I need nor want any other shoes. OK, I need Shimanos for the clipless bike pedals too. Hey Tsubo--how about making some bicycling shoes 
Many fashionable shoes keep that as their main focus. This is my second pair of Tsubos and I am continually impressed by the incredible comfort and durability they provide while maintaining its stylishness. 
This was a gift for my mom (I've never actually seen it)and she loves it. It arrived on time for her birthday and she's planning to buy them for all of her other world traveling friends 
It is very warm, but it is somewhat awkward to get it 
I saw the Cabin Cuddler featured in the Travel section of our Sunday paper and thought of my daughter-in-law who is always wrapping up in blankets to keep warm. I ordered one for her birthday and she loves it. It is lightweight and easy to use whether she is at home or traveling to visit us. She loves the handy "foot pocket" to keep her feet warm. 
I've traveled with it and just used it to cuddle up. I'm very pleased with my purchase and its handy bag. thanks 
I bought this for travel, but have ended up using it virtually everyday while at home. Its great for curling up on the couch and keeping your feet snuggly warm. The design is so creative with a foot pocket and separate shoulder wrap--I haven't seen anything like it. I've been giving it as gifts to family members and it gets rave reviews from everyone--travellers and couch potatoes alike! 
An absolutely wonderful product! I was given one as a gift and can't do without it on my regular business holiday flights. It stores very neatly and attaches conveniently to your flight case. Congratulations on a truly brilliant product - EVERYONE WHO TRAVELS SHOULD HAVE ONE! No more itchy, small airline blankets for me! Buy one for your husband, wife, sister, brother, mother, father, friend - anyone who travels frequently. A STAR PRODUCT **** 
The Cabin Cuddler was great on the plane but I use it at home too on those chilly nights when you don't want to rack up the heating bill. It is perfect for watching television or reading and having hands free to turn pages or work the remote. It is pet friendly too and so easy to wash and dry. I am very pleased with it 
great product. shoes didn't fit and return was easy. no problems at al 
Trying to find a great present for my grandson is quite challenging. These were a smashing hit! I wouldn't be surprised if he slept with them on! 
My son LOVES his Heelys!!!! I can't say enough about how much he uses them and how wonderfully they are made. I like the fact that you can change out the wheel (to use as regular sneakers during school time) and have the wheels in for after school play. I've also already had to wash them and they came out great! Definitely best gift for my 7 year-old!....It only took about two days to get the hang of how to ride on them! 
Well, i tried these on in a store and they seemed to fit great but wen i receieved them, they were a bit tight but i'm assuming it was due to them being new. they squished my toes a bit but once u kind of move ur toes around you can find a good position for them. other than that, im not used to such a high heel, but im gonna give it a try today. these shoes are beautiful and for $20, im not complaining! they make anybody's legs look great and once i get used to them, i plan on buying more! if you love 3 3/4 -4 inch heels, you'll love thes 
The shoes looked wide in front but upon trying out, my toes are squashed and it can be quite uncomfortable. Nontheless, the heels are nice and presentable. Can only be worn for a short time 
These shoes are an excellent buy if you are looking for a high fashion look. Unfortunately, they were too "spiky" for me. But, the quality of the shoes is great. Very upscale, rich look 
I love these scarves. I have one in nearly every color. I even talked my sister into making me several of them. They wash up well and are very warm. I have six of these kind and several of the kind that Target has. Try it you'll like it 
I agree with everyone else on this one I do love these beautiful scarves! they are the softest and warmest scarves I have ever bought I own 3 of them myself. Where I live they are very popular and nearly everyone I know has at least one of them. However I bought mine at the local mall for $5.99 so I would not buy them on here for twice as much but if it's convenient for you guys out there go for it 
They sell magic scarves at the Hallmark near my house, and my friend and I went in a bought two of them because they were so pretty and soft, and we didn't even notice that they were big tubes until we got in the car and started playing with them. I wear it every day and it hasn't gotten messed up at all, and it's amazingly warm and perfect! There's so many different ways to wear it, and I love it. Even my boyfriend wants one now 
The pink one concludes my pink clothing look. Magic scarfs are fun to put on your head and say "GIVE ME YOUR MONEY". I did this when I was on vaction and my cousin did it with me, her mom just laughed. This scarf is the best 
I received a maroon one as a gift and have gotten endless complements on it. When I walked into a knitting shop, the owner thought I had made it until she looked closely at it's edge. I wish I could knit one like it! I tried to knit one and couldn't get it to have the resiliency. It becomes a long tube scarf, or a becoming hat-capelet. It's fluffy yet warm though light, even though it isn't wool. It washes easily. HIghly recommended 
I saw one of these scarves at the J and M bookstore in Auburn University during a big game weekend, and it was sold in the University's colors of Orange and blue. This scarf is soft and stretchy, but no matter what you do to it, it stays fluffy and fuzzy with a silky powder puff texture to it. I think I might wait to go back and get the orange and blue version though, I like those colors better than the those shown above 
I go to high school and my class color is purple. Finally I found something that is cool to wear on color wars days. They look very good and do not look cheap at all. They were also very bright and shiny. I am very pleased 
They look great feel great. I wear them to B-ball practice and my mom broght me another pair cause I like them so much I reck a men you buying a pair or 
I bought this shirt for my husband to wear during the Super Bowl, since he planned to view the game with a die-hard Bears fan. Let's just say that die-hard fan wanted to know where we got it, because he loved the design! The price sure is right, too. And even though my husband is a Vikings fan, this is one shirt he wears anyway. 
Great shirt. Colors are great. Sizing is generous, so don't order big 
These are the most comfortable panties I have ever owned in my life. They fit right, don't ride up and look like new washing after washing. I hope to never have to do without the Vanity Fair Microfiber panties again. I would pay $10 a pair for these if I had to, they truly are awesome!! 
Did business in the past with them and will do so in the future 
I always have a hard time with my 17 year old son, finding long pants that are durable and yet comfortable enough to compete with his soccer shorts. Length is always an issue for us, since he's 6'6" with 36" inseam. These cargo pants were perfect! They are well made, durable, long enough and have drawstrings both at waist and ankle for size adjustment. Plenty of cargo space for cell phone, keys, wallet and more. I ordered 3 pair and am glad I did 
These are great pants, very comfortable. The zipper is a bit rough but other than that I love these pants. Now I know why my son always wears his combat fatigues even when he is out of uniform 
I have a big butt and big legs- these fit really comfortably. the zipper sometimes sticks on them but I love the pants. 
My Son's happy with items from this Seller..Good communication from Seller regarding delay...arrived within reasonable time and prior to X-mas...Will Return... 
I bought these pants for my son, and he loves them. I got a pair in every color, and this is all he wears. they do not shrink, but we did find they run small in the waist. he is 13, and wears a 29" waist, and we had to get the mens medium. i thought the small would have fit, but it was a very fast exchange with the company. no problems at all. and they tie on the bottom, so the lenghth does not matter. will buy again!! very well made product!!! A+++++++++ THANKS!! 
As an emergency response volunteer, I need comfortable, sturdy pants with a lot of pockets. These fit the bill nicely. The pockets are a good size and easy to secure. The pants are lightweight and comfortable while being able to take some abuse, thanks to the reinforced knees and tough material. My only question is what the "drawstrings" on the legs are for. They don't actually gather the leg when you pull them. In fact, they don't seem to have any purpose at all. I am happy with the purchase and I am sure I will purchase the same thing again 
The size was perfect and so was the color. It looked just like it did on the web page:) 
Shoe is fairly comfortable, gives excellent support when running and still allows your feet to breathe 
Very very comfortable... great price... would purchase again... Better than my Nike Shocks... 
The shoes lived up to my expectations - you just need to wear them couple of days (or run couple of hours) before they fully adjust to your feet 
The Adidas a3 Gigaride is definitely one of the best athletic shoes I've ever owned. I usually go with Nike/Jordan brand, but I decided to give these pair a try and I'm very happy with them. The cushioning system is very similiar to the Nike Shox, but feels much more isolated from the shocks of running on pavement. At the same time, the cushioning does not feel mushy or too soft. It is very controlled and firm at the same time. I'd recommend a pair ito anyone who likes to run 
I am not sure why, but I get just a little water in through one of the gloves. I drive a concrete mixer and use them anytime I am dealing with water. They are durable and do an execellent job of keeping my hands warm and dry (with exception of the one leak) 
This one actually WORKS! The others I have tried rolled down and made your situation worse looking! And these are easy to wash....I just throw mine in a mesh pantihose bag and in the washer....comes out perfect! Love them! 
I recently purchased a pair of these slippers as a gift for a family member. Shipping was extremly prompt and I received them in three days. Although a very nice product, one of the slippers was obviously used/worn so I emailed the company with this information. I received a response from TV Guys the very next day, asking for a phone number where I could be reached so that the problem could be resolved. I emailed them my number and received a call the following day. The gentleman I spoke with was very apologetic, explained that he had no idea how this could have happened, and asked what he could do to fix the situation. I asked for a full refund and he was more than willing to refund my entire purchase as well as the shipping charges I had incurred. Because of the promptness and professionalism with which this incident was handled, I will order from them again in the future 
We received the sweatshirt in a timely manner. In fact, sooner than expected. The sweatshirt was exactly what we expected and of good quality. I am very happy with the service 
This is a great sweatshirt. Exactly how it was listed. I gave it as a gift and he loved it 
Great Jack at a reasonable cost. Material is excellent and comfortable to wear out of the package, choice of color. Shipped in a timely manner. Would continue to buy On Line from Amazon 
I absolutely love these stockings! They are beautiful, durable and comfortable. The micro mesh pattern is a classier more subtle version of the fishnet which means you can wear these to work without giving your boss a heart attack 
These are great jeans. My 4 year old son has now begun crawling around while playing with his cars, these jeans hold out for a very long time. I will get these and Old Navy jeans any day! 
We were very pleased with our recently ordered bowling shoes! They were a little tight initially but now fit quite well and look femanine! They were received in record time as well. Thanks 
I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE BOWLING SHOES. THEY ARE ACTUALLY NICER THAN THE PIC SHOWED. SERVICE WAS FAST AND EASY 
I'm a recreational bowler, so I only bowl once in a while. I'm not a great bowler, but these shoes are a great value for the money. So far no complaints 
I love my new bowling shoes! The size was right on target, unlike clothes where sometimes a size 5 pant fits but yet another pair of the same size in another brand name is way too big or small. Order a size shoe you normally wear. They are light-weight and durable. Expedient delivery and great courteous service too! 
Great pair of shoes for the price. They are very comfortable and stylish 
Much better than renting. I like the shoes, and there really pretty. Hopefully, I will improve my game. Good shoe, great price 
Now, I'm no expert on bowling shoes. The only ones I had ever worn were the rentals at the alley, but I bought these and they are super comfortable and lightweight. Believe it or not, they actually helped me improve my bowling game because I have better control now. They seem to run true to size because I bought my usual 7 1/2 and they fit like there custom made. 
I especially like the look of this shoe. I like bowling but not the bowling shoes. Dexter Bowling Dottie is a nice looking shoe 
The colors are MUCH brighter than they appear. I still like it though. Just not quite as versitile as I had hoped 
This jacket is beautiful, fits great and looks very expensive and professional. I ordered this jacket big enough that I can pair it with a nice long sleeve button down shirt. The sizing is great 
My husband was very happy with the leather blazer. The leather is very soft and a beautiful color. The fit was also very good. We were happy with this purchase 
..it's everything i expected. fits like true size, and the real thing looks sooo much better than the photos. plus it's soo comfortable. I can walk all day in these babies and i dont even feel a pinch in my feet. it's absolutely awesome : 
Pedro Slip-on is easy get in and out, it is perfect for folks on the run. Department store would cost twice the price plus tax 
Best 50 bucks I've ever spent. I have a valet job and work outside all winter, I wear these things every day under a pair of thin Dockers and they are fantastic. I'm a bigger guy, and the compression gear tops don't work well with my big gut, these are just right for my lower body type. If you're a size 38-40 waist like me, go with the XXL, it's just the right size. Combined with the Under Armour Driver Mock (actually a golf item) my base layer is perfect, I never get cold. I recently wore the same combination skiing, and the leggings were perfect under my snow pants. Just pull them up to the top of the sock with a little overlap and no moisture accumulates against your body whatsoever, a very important element of staying warm and safe when it's cold out. All of Under Armour's products I have tried do a great job of this moisture transportation away from your skin and I'll never wear cotton or other long underwear again. Do yourself a favor and try these out, they are the new gold standard in my book 
I hate the cold. I mean I really HATE it, after getting frost bite on my nose and ears. However, I try not to let it slow me down. I run except in the coldest weather (like now its almost 0F with the wind chill). Whenever the temperature drops to 40F or less, I wear these and my running shorts. I can wear them to about 60F, then I overheat and have to shed them. They are great except the fit; they were too small in the quads, so I chose a XXL. When the weather gets very cold (25F to 10F), I layer additional clothing on top, wind pants, jeans, whatever. See my Smartwool reviews about other cold weather gear that I wear 
These are probably one of my favorite articles of clothing. I am a frequent (normally 5+ times a week) endurance runner, and I have found these to be a great addition to my gym bag. Whenever it's too chilly to wear shorts, I'll pull on my Underarmour coldgear leggings and throw my shorts on top of them. Thay keep my legs nice and warm without overheating them. I also tend to use these as a base layer under everything from jeans to my dress pants whenever it's cold out. Again, they keep my legs warm , but not too warm. I also like the fit of these leggings. They are tight around the legs, providing good muscle support and compression (good for reducing injuries and soreness), without being too uncomfortable in the crotch and rear (provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes, they are supposed to be worn as underwear). They also have what feels like a synthetic microsuede interior, which just ads to the overall comfort level. I have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold, especially when they don't wear anything on top. I like to be slightly cooler when running, so these work for me. If you can't stand being a bit on the cool side, you probably shouldn't leave any part of the tights uncovered (wear something over that completely covers them), but if you don't, yo won't be shivering either 
It is very confortable and looks great. I recently weent to New York and used it all around.IT was very confortable and fashonable :) 
This item appears to be a short mini skirt in the picture, but it runs kinda long. I wouldnt reccomend going down a size though, it runs small around the waist. I do like the skirt though, its a really cute plaid and nicely styled 
We received the jersey when they said we would and it was just what we wa nted 
It was just what I wanted and came quicker than I thought. Price was righ 
My son loves his jersey. He tries to wear it every day! The quality is very good. I would purchase agai 
This is a gift for my 13 yr old son, who does not have it just yet. I am positive that he will be very excited and enjoy wearing it 
READ REVIEWS FROM OTHER'S WHO PURCHASED SIMILAR ITEMS. I AM A LARGE WOMAN WHO LIKES TO FISH WITH MY HUSBAND. IT JUST TURNED WINDY AND COOLER HERE IN BUFFALO SO HE SUGGESTED I GET A RAIN PANCHO AND GALOSHES FOR WARMTH AND TO WALK ACROSS SHALLOW WATERS. I ENDED UP PURCHASING THIS JACKET AM GLAD I DID. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE QUALITY FOR THE MONEY! A NICE MEDIUM WEIGHT,WITH MUCH ATTENTION TO DETAIL. I LOVE THE SNAPS DOWN THE FRONT, AS WELL AS ON THE CUFFS [I PURCHASED A MEN'S 2XL,NORMALLY WEAR SIZE 22/24] AND WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SLEEVES BEING TOO LONG. WITH THE SNAP ON THE CUFFS, NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE LENGTH! LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE, SINCE I WILL HAVE A SWEATSHIRT OR LIGHTWEIGHT JACKET UNDERNEATH. THIS WILL REALLY SERVE THE PURPOSE AND I'M SURE I'LL USE THIS FOR OTHER THAT FISHING TRIPS TOO! THIS WOULD BE A GREAT JACKET FOR AN EVEN HIGHER PRICE-----YOU WON'T BE SORRY 
I bought these to wear on vacation in Hawaii. They are very comfortable and breathe in hot weather. They looked very nice for both semi-dress wear and for casual wear. When I got home, I ordered another pair in brown. They are generously cut, so if you are on the border of two sizes you may want to go with the smaller one 
Excellent shoe. It's very comfortable, very stylish, (if you like something a bit retro) and versatile. If I have to complain about a feature of the shoe is the shoe laces because they're waxy and they tend to come undone... but don't let that deter you. I highly recommend this shoe 
I received the shoes in a timely fashion and love wearing them 
Clark shoes are like no other shoes that I've worn. You can put a new pair on and walk several miles and your feet will not hurt. There is no waiting for your feet to get accustomed to the shoe. You put them on and go 
These shoes are another well-spent purchase of Clarks. They are really comfortable and attractive. And with all my other pairs of Clarks, I had to wear them in for a few days so that they would not chaffe my achilles tendon. Warning, wear socks or vband aids for a few days or you won't get too far without blisters. When the shoes wear in, then there are no more blisters and the ride is very luxurious. 
These shoes are very pretty, and so comfortable and graceful feeling- without looking orthopedic at all. They are classy, and make you look good because you are standing straight up and looking comfy 
i am a 32DD and most bras made for women with larger busts start at 34, if you're lucky. this is a godsend! and when i put it on, it was like a miracle. i am running and jumping and all with only one sports bra on. i feel like a normal person again. it is pricey but what can i do? apparently it is a crime to have a bust 
I highly reccomend this bra! I am a 34E. I started training for a half marathon. Before I bought this bra I used other thicker "sports bras" I had cuts underneath my breast after running. They were really bad. I bought the Shock Absorber and now I can run 13+ miles without any cuts or chaffing. Don't let the lightweight feel of the bra fool you! It is an excellent bra. I am on my third one. While I was washing it I tried the other bra again last week and again I got cuts underneath my breast. This is an excellent bra for ladies with big breast like me 
I can recommend these Impact Level 4 Berlei Sports Bras 100%. I have 6 of them and have been wearing them for a little over a year. They completely minimise bounce and are the most comfortable supportive Sports Bra on the market! I wish they would make a skin coloured one 
where are larger sizes for big chested ladies, we exercise also!! 
I purchased these sandles for my 17 year old son. He loves them. They are good quality sandal and is a good value for the money 
You know, after looking at several sites I discovered that it is a little trying to find a simple black flip-flop with no pretentious heirs about it. I finally found it in this shoe. It's your basic run-of-the-mill flip-flop but also has a solid black coloring which looks pretty sharp as well. The sole seems to be pretty durable and the thick nylon strap seems to keep your foot in place. The standard shipment didn't take an exceptionally long amount of time, which I liked, but once the shoes did arrive I discovered that they came in a simple clear plastic bag. No shoe-box given. Normally I wouldn't have mind as they are only flip-flops but as they were ment to be a Christmas gift it would have been nice to have a matching box to wrap them in 
This is the best fitting and most comfortable bra I have ever owned. It gives a lovely shape. The only problem is the fabric used to make it. As another person has said, every one of these bras that I've bought has split. The floral outer fabric is so fragile, I've even put my finger through a nearly new one! Very disappointing. I wish they would make this same bra out of some sturdier fabric. Then it would be the perfect bra 
These are the most comfortable bras I have ever bought. Most bras do not have a wide enough band on the side so the body tends to hang over the material. This bra has a nice wide side band. I now have several of these in all 3 colors. 
This is a great casual shirt. Very cute! It does run true to size. Checking the provided sizing chart is a good idea if you are not sure of the size. I wear a 10-12 so I got the extra large because I do not like my clothes snug it fits me fine 
I LOVE these shoes. My husband and I own three pairs each 
For years I tried many different shoes until I found Saucony's I will not wear anything but Saucony. I purchased this style and they are very comfortable, I speed walk, hike cross country and weight train in them. Very comfy, sturdy and stylish. www.bodysculptingbyjanina.com 
OMG !!! i absolutely loved my sandals, they are comfortable, match everything and are perfect for summer. will buy again!!! plus fast shipping! 
bought as a gift for my son. i was thought it had a very nice scent. my son seems to be pleased with it also 
i bought 2 sets of these (blue and black) because of the price and to really stock up. they look nice and just as pictured but the fit on these is less than desirable. if you (or your man) like to just wear their boxers when lounging around the house they may find these have an awkward feel and constraint. because of this constraint as far as movement i DO NOT recommend anyone wearing these if they plan on being even remotely active during their day. played a couple hours of basketball and these boxers were not comfortable at all. for everyday lounging while wearing shorts/pants then they feel fine. for someone who likes to run, jog, or play sports, i highly recommend finding a different set 
This is the perfect gown for the hospital and after you get home, it makes nusring so much easier, Thanks for the great product 
Love my nursing gown I almost haven't taken it off I have the PJ's too and they are grea 
Thanks so much for the great product! It was so cozy and easy to nurse my baby. The fabric is also really soft. Loved the sizing help before I ordered, it saved me from an exchange since I was going to order the wrong size. You don't come across alot of companies that give personal service. I will definitelly recommend you, Samantha 
In fact, I'm ordering a second for myself and one for a mom to be. This was the best nursing gown I've owned with either pregnancy. I love the fact that you really don't have to wear a sleep bra with it and the "leak pads" stay in place. I received it as a gift in the mail and was dying to know who sent it so I could give a big thank you to. I love the fact that it has the pull down access intead of the slits. It allows you to stay covered if you want to wear it around the house. Also, it's sexier than most nursing gowns so an added bonus for the husband. 
I ordered these shirts to wear as a uniform dress shirt. The price and the product fit my need very well. They were also delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I was very pleased with my transation 
I really like this product. Even after a full day, I am still comfortable. Wearing such a large size is hard to come by sometimes. Especially when I enjoy the front closure. There are very few to choose from. I was lucky to find this. It really is comfortable supporting at the the same time. This is really hard sometimes, trying to find both. I feel I found that in this product. I hope they don't discontinue the item. Thanks again Vanity Fair 
It's so nice to not have to drive all over town looking for something, to find exactly what you want, and at a bargain price! Super service and what a deal 
I was pleased with the service of the retailer, and the quality of the web belt I bought. It cost less than other retailers, and functions fine. Why pay more? I received e-mails letting me know one belt I ordered was out of stock,and would be sent later. That doesn't bother me. I got my belt in the U.S. mail. The whole process was a lot easier than driving across town to shop in a store which probably would have charged me a great deal more money. 
This company, Andrew Christian did an excellent job. This was a small order. Nevertheless, the price was reasonable, the quality good, and the items arrived the same day as my Amazon book purchase. Excellent job all around 
Well I was meaning to write you guys about that I ask for 2X-large but you guy send me a LG/XL shirt I did not want to send it back, because i was looking for that kind of shrit for over two years. next just make sure that you send a right order that ask for it if don't have just say so. 
Fine t-shirt, but didn't know it was Purple. Brings to mind the great line from Babylon 5: Londo "but in Purple I am stunning" 
I'm so happy I took a chance and bought this item, it's exactly what I needed. I bought the small/medium in black and it has a circumference of 23 3/4 Inches (60cm). The Headband is curved, at the widest point it is 3 inches and narrows to 2 1/4 inches. The width of 3 inches, is sufficient to completely cover my ears. It is only 3% Elastine, so there is a minimal stretch and it doesn't feel tight against my head, nor is it too loose to require constant adjusting. It sits comfortably, the polar fleece is what I would call a micro polar fleece - it has a small short pile and doesn't feel cheap. I have worn this headband in temperatures as low as 15 Degrees Fahrenheit and it keeps my ears warm. Unlike earmuffs I can wear the headband indoors, it's one less Winter accessory that I have to remove whenever I step inside a building 
This shoe is absoultly wonder a very comfortable and a great looking shoe... 
I am pleased with the quality of the pants, but was disappointed that they did not have cuffs. The Web site indicated that pants through waist size 44 had cuffs. I ordered size 44, but the pants did not have cuffs 
Excellent choice for someone who wants to be casual, yet not too casual. Comfortable aswell 
I got the sheos promptly. They fit. the colors are magnificent, I'd buy again, with all the variety I think I have to. I'm also glad that they come in such an array of sizes. I have large feet and I finally have some shoes in my size that aren't granny shoes 
These are great lightweight slippers with rubber soles. They are warm and handy. They provide absolutely no support so if you have bad feet, they are not good for wearing for long periods. 
I do not go without something on my feet. These moon boots are a great slipper. They are terry cloth and have a flexable rubber sole. It feels like I am not wearing anything, yet I can walk outside in them. I wore out the two pairs I had purchased years ago and searched several cataloges as well as the web for them. I am so glad I found them on Amazon.com 
This is exactly what I was looking for. Last year I had a back surgery and I needed a bra that would fit me but would be very lose on my back because my current bra was too tight for my very sensitive back. I bought a bra that was two or three sizes bigger than my actual size but it did not work. It was still too tight. I finnally bought these bra extenders and they are perfect!! I can continue using my same bras and they are now lose enough so that they do not cause me any pain.It comes in pairs of two, but I only need to use one of the extenders, wich ties to the other extreme of my bra. 
I'm so glad I got these. It solved my issues with now too-tight bands and I can wear my pre-pregnancy bras without complaining that I can't breathe. I do have a couple of 3-hook bras that don't conform to the sizes available but since they give you the measurement of the band, I was able to get extenders for the bras that fall within the range that they offer. I'm very happy with those. I even ordered a couple more in different colors. The items arrived within the shipping estimate they gave, despite the holidays. And if they offer free shipping for other products in the future, I will certainly buy more things from this vendor 
These were for my mom and they got here in a timely fashion and were what she wanted. Pleased with service 
Handy for those of use that do not want to spend money on another whole bra. This is much cheaper and very easy to use when we need more length to around our bust 
Being pregnant and quickly growing, these are big money savers. Be sure to measure your bras to get the right size. I purchased a couple of the 3 hook narrow ones. They matched perfectly with the hooks on my bras and they're comfortable. Don't waste your time with the extenders with elastic bands on them. I bought some at Walmart and the elastic started to stretch out/warp after only 2 days of wear. 
I bought these shoes for my 12 hour days nursing. they're great. the shoes are "vented" on the sides and therefore my foot breathes and doesn't sweat 
tennis shoe I have ever worn. Cute too! True to size. I would definitey buy these again 
They look more professional in the office than denims, but are ready to go into the field any time. Another advantage over "five pocket jeans" is the accessory pockets - great for the cell phone, calculator, Leatherman tool, and/or whatever, without the "cargo pants" look. Also - "Assembled in Mexico with USA components". Closer to home than China. 
Fits great, super soft and slouches a lot more than you would think. Very good boot and comfortable. 
I know the item arrived on time a it's OK but I don't have it yet; I'm expecting to have it at the end of January when relatives of mine come back to Argentina but as I know everything is OK. Thanks a lot. Bert 
The quality of these shirts are nice. The only slight complaint is that the the neck area is a bit tight. You might want to consider getting one size larger than you normally wear. 
very fine quality shirt, comfortable, shipped expediately. Very satisfied with this produc 
This well-made, relatively heavyweight, 100% cotton T-shirt fits just right on my middle-aged frame, feels nice and silky, and didn't shrink much in a cold-water wash. Plus, everybody seems to like the shade of red, including me. Recommended 
We bought both this brand Artiga and the Soffe to compare. We like Artiga more as far as a somewhat silkier look and feel, but run a tad smaller. You may want to order a size larger than you usually wear. Soffe was also excellent quality, but more in the vein of a true cotton t-shirt and runs true to size 
Bought 2 and buying 6 more now. My son wears Tees everyday and these are equal or better to the ones I usually buy at Banana or Abercrombie for 20.00 Soft and wash really well. He actaully told me how comfortable they feel and gave me a big kiss. Also think I will try the Long Sleeve ones for only a buck more 
I was having pain in my feet because of other flip flops not supporting the arch. Foot pain has gone away. ..so has the pain of finding a bottle opener. Very comfortable. 
These life stride shoes fit like a glove! They don't pinch and they were made with quality. I really like these 
Few words to describe this shoe, very good arch support and cushion insole. True to size, good leather and soles. A great shoe for comfort, and walking..I've purchased other Life-Stride Dean styles and recommend all of them ! Mar 
As a matter of fact, I have them on right now! Comfortable is the word. Stylish, a great value for the buy. 
To be able to get something this stylish and practical while supporting such a heart-warming cause is just incredible. Its a consumer's dream. We need more products like this. I've never felt so good about a purchase. It was the perfect gift for my mom and sister who both love the bag and the story 
Stunning look, excellent craftmanship and enough storage space. That's a really good gift for a smart lady 
The stitching on the front of shirt is defective so the shirt folds and stretched out... 
This wallet is beautiful and has lots of room! The two inner pockets are perfect for storing bills and the other for reciepts or coupons. And neither gets mixed up! The inner zipper pocket between the 2 inner pockets is perfect for my change! The best part of this wallet is that its roomy. There's a space for everything with out losing anything 
Excellent compnay and I am very pleased with the wallet. It was everything I wanted 
My daughter absolutely loved the wallet. I personally did not realize it was a very popular item with the girls 
After visiting with 2 other mommies that had Tuffos, I decided to purchase one for our burgeoning family---Supercool! Lightweight, waterproof, many choices with pattern, love the carry strap thing. Kind of wish the straps were part of the blanket itself, but I understand that it would compromise the waterproof backing. Be careful when pulling off the mfc tag, can tear the stiches! Great product overall, we think! MauiMommie23 
This is a great blanket! The back is a water-resistant material so you don't get wet when sitting on damp grass. The top is a soft cotton type material. The blanket is lightly padded to keep you comfortable from hard ground and small pebbles. It's machine washable. It folds up easily to fit back in the matching tote bag that it comes packed in. It's large enough to hold two adults, a baby and all of the baby's play things. I'm so glad I purchased this and I look forward to many years of use 
This would be a 5 star if it wasn't so bulky to carry - but I don't see how it could. Otherwise, we love it 
I got these shoes just in time for Spring and they are comfortable but, are high enough so that they don't feel dowdy. Nice pair of shoes 
I sent two sets to my twin grandsons, and they fit perfectly and are comfortable for growing boys. The vendor was fast in getting the items out and I would and have shopped with them again. 
I got this case because I needed something to protect my new iPod Shuffle. I also got it so it would match my black headphones (I got the black color case.. obviously..) I find that the case works well. It fits the shuffle very nicely. The face buttons are easy to navigate as the volume up/down and forward/back buttons are clearly formed within the silicone case. There is a slight misfit on the back of the case where the clip meets the back of the shuffle, but it's very minute, and doesn't interfere with the overall look and fit of the case; i never really notice it. That why it gets 4 stars and not the full. Overall, I'm happy with the case. It's also a great price 
Really, these are very comfortable. I work on my feet all day. With other shoes my feet feel like they swell up, and I get a pain from toes to heel. These feel like moccasins with support. They're highly recomended. 
Excellent fit for us overly endowed folks. Wanted another one so just went on line to Bali and they sent me to Biels in Florida. On time delivery and product was as asked for 
This bra will hold you in and minimize but the material is is junky satina which does not breath so be prepared to sweat. You'll soak in the summer 
My mom wears this bra and told me to try it. I'm really glad I did. "The girls" have been getting bigger and bigger over the years, and this bra really makes them look smaller. I highly recommend it. But make sure you get the right size - the material is not flexible (of course, or else it couldn't hold you in) so if it is even a bit too small it's quite uncomfortable 
I show horses, and this bra controls the "bounce and jiggle" better than any other I've tried 
This bag is so cute! Really roomy inside, and I've had it only one day and I already had like hundreds of complements on it! It came very quickly, and the service and packaging was outstanding! I'll definitley recommend this to everyone! 
The bow did come loose on me, but is easily re-tied. It's just the right size bag and even with a lot of stuff is pretty lightweight. I've had some roomy bags that were very heavy, not the case with this. I am usually skeptical and picky about handbags and buying such an item online, but I was pleasantly surprised. I would buy from this seller again -- they are prompt and quick. I had it in 2-3 days from when I ordered 
Perfect Size for me. I love the length of the strap. Very well made. The only reason I rated it a 4 is because I was looking for a red bag and this design doesn't have it. I am experimenting this new brown and I am growing to like it more and more 
I ordered two different colors, the pink and camel....I must say I fell in love with them!! The bags are beautiful!! I was VERY impressed with the fast delivery and exceptional packaging!! Each bag was also placed in a special protective cloth type bag of their own to protect each one for shipping... 
I love all these t shirts.....I got them for the cruise and I have always been pleased with my purchases on Amazon ... 
I'm a runner and go through a lot of white socks. I wanted to stock up on a new set, so I bought about 5 different kinds to see which I liked best, and then would stock up on those. This one was the winner! They are extremely durable, and VERY comfortable. They have so much padding and cushion, I like just wearing them around the house, and they feel like you have slippers on. The Thorlo XJ-11 Running Crew Socks were also very nice, well padded, etc., but were A LOT more expensive, and I actually prefer these Russell socks better. The Thorlo's don't breath nearly as well. I highly recommend these socks. A good value, very durable, extremely comfortable, great cushion for runners, and breath great. Kevi 
These shirts are well-made and hold up well in the wash. I ordered a whole bunch of them because of the good price. They are part of my summer "uniform" - khaki shorts and a khaki t-shirt. The only way they could be improved is if they were "tagless" 
I love this bag! I use it all the time now. It is perfect for all the random things that I need to take with me 
Wow, this is as good a quality as I've seen in the catalogs that are known for good boat totes, but at about 1/3 the cost. Definitely recommend this 
IT IS MY MAIN BAG NOW, EVERYTHING FITS INTO THAT I NEED TO TAKE ON TRIPS TO THE BEACH. THE STRAPS ARE STRONG, AND EASY TO CARRY 
I bought this tote a couple of weeks ago, and has been using it day in and day out. It is a very convenient tote that you can depends on. Anyone who likes tote bags from Funtote [...] or Marimekko should also loves this bag 
This product was great...I bought two for a gift for Christmas, this one and another one from a brand name that cost 5 times as much and I returned the more expensive one...this one had a lot better quality so I was happy! I'm thinking of buying one for myself now! 
I bought this item as a gift for my daughter. It is well made and the color is beautiful. The length of the handles are perfect 
this bag is awesome. i use it to take a ton of books and sometimes my computer to and from the library and work. It can weigh up to 25 lbs, and the straps still hold the weight with out any signs of breaking down. the best part though is that the bottom of the bag is square so it stands upright, making it easy to access everything inside of it. I also like the orange color 
I love this bag! The quality of the canvas and stitching is wonderful. I would have expected to pay a lot more for this bag. The orange is a great color 
I didn't expect such high quality at this price, but the material and construction of this tote bag is just as good as those sold by more expensive stores. I ordered a few of these to give as gifts to my bridesmaids (its a beach wedding and I am going to fill the bags with fun gifts!) My only regret is not ordering one for myself! 
I bought one for myself and one for my sister. We both love it 
hey, they look good, and have a nice feel to em. my feet are a little wide so there is a little rubbing along my little toe area, but that was only during a very long day on my feet. Problems: Well I would just call this an interesting trait, they have these stud like things on the bottom, the make you feel really bouncy until you get used to them. they also have a bad habit of squeeking on marble and certain tile floors. people will turn their heads every now and then.. that could be a good or a bad thing, just depends who's looki 
I have not found anything negative to say about this luggage. It is sturdy, well made and has lots of storage compartments. The wheels roll so smoothly that it makes pulling a loaded suitcase almost effortless and that is a good thing, because I have a heavy travel schedule this year. So far, I have to say this is the best luggage I have ever owned 
I received these socks as a Christmas gift and they are the best socks I've ever owned!! They are very comfortable and don't get all bunched up in my shoes!! They kept their shape and size after being washed many times!! These socks are the best and I love them!! I just wish that they made them in more colors and fun patterns!! 
what a wonderful set of socks, the receiver of the gift was extremely happ 
THESE SOCKS WERE ORDERED FOR CHRISTMAS ON DEC 9. THEY WERE INSTOCK AND WERE PROMISED BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THEY ARRIVED ON JAN 10, AND WERE NOT THE COLOR I ORDERED (MINE WERE RED AND PINK STRIPED LIKE THE PICTURE, THE ONES THEY SENT WERE SOLID RED). I FIANALLY HAD TO SHOP ON CHRISTMAS EVE, (MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY) WHAT A STRESSED OUT MESS THE HOLIDAYS WERE FOR ME JUST BECAUSE I COUNTED ON THIS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER VENDORS FROM AMAZON. NEVER AGAI 
This is an excellent product. They are by far the best socks I've ever worn. They don't fall down, hold their shape after repeated washings and are soft and comfortable. I love the two tone effect when the rolled top shows the contrasting interior color. These are truly wonderful socks 
I like them! They're perfect for summer, or any time you don't need really warm socks 
Very cute purse, exactly what I was looking for. I even had an ink pen bleed a huge mess in the bottom within the first week, and much to my surprise, I was able to get nearly all of the black out of the liner material 
I got my order in a short amount of time, I will definetly buy from this company again 
I purchase these boots because of the color. I have several pairs of brown leather boots (mostly dark brown) but the color of this pair is unique. I get so many compliments on the boots mostly comments on the color. The leather is so soft oustside and inside. I purchase the boots in a size smaller because they have a gap at the top of the boots which I didn't like. However, when I purchase the same boots in black I got them a size smaller to see if the gap was less noticeable and it was so I did the same with these 
I feel like I got a Great deal, the quality of the leather is superb, what a beautiful boot, they are comfortable as well. Thanks 
I love these boots. The leather is soft, they are very, very comfortable although it is a high heel, and they keep your legs warm (due to their 15 inch in length). These elegant boots are true to fit, classy, you and will get many compliments. They do have a gap at the top, but even with a mini skirt you look natural, so do not worry. I got them on sale from Amazon with free shipping, so that was a big plus for me. Way to go Amazon! 
Nice looking boots but to large in the calf area going up to the knee. The boots leave a noticable gap if your wearing a skirt, if your planning on wearing pants tucked into the boots they are perfect. 
This is a gorgeous boot -- simple but elegant style, with a high, graceful heel. These boots go with everything from casual to dressy, and, although the toes are quite pointed, they are extremely comfortable. I can wear them all day and walk considerable distances, and they still feel great. I had never ordered shoes by mail before, so I was somewhat apprehensive; however, I couldn't be more pleased. Without question, these are the best boots I've ever owned 
These are the greatest boots I have ever owned. I have received so many compliments, and they go with everything. If only I had more $, I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat 
No rabbits were killed for these gloves, can't these guys read. And I also happen to think fur is ideal for warmth. Yes, native americans and all the people the ultra left worship wore fur. communists wore fur. TO KEEP WARM. These gloves are soft and luxurious and I love the 
These gloves are stylish and extremely warm. I'd buy them again anytime. 
These pants are great for anyone tall and thin. I'm 5'4" and weigh 105 pounds. Size small fits me great with plenty of length. 32" inch inseam is hard to find in my size. Super comfortable too. And talk about fast delivery... it took like one day to get here and that was with standard UPS shipping. Thank you UPS.. 
They ar great. Glad I didn't get the bigger size. They fit perfectly. Anyone who buys these boots will totally love them 
these are such comfortable boots! if you want sheepskin boots without paying a bunch for UGGS, then these are the ones. i highly recommend water proofing them first thing, because they're a bit hard to clean 
I am very happy that I purchased these boots. They were the right price and a great knock-off of uggs. 
Do you have a hard time finding quality black socks? Don't buy the Fluffy version since it will just make your foot sweat. This sock can be worn hundreds of times before the heal will become low. Cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Never itches or scratches. Stays up and not too tight. The perfect sock 
This shirt is comfortable and fits well as long as you wash it a lot. I have a tendency to wear a shirt non-stop for days and it gets stretched. Other than that I love the color selection too 
i LOVE these bras and DON'T wear any other but these ... in the passed, i brought so many other types of bras and they NEVER seems to fit right or comfortable. when i saw these onsale at kohl's, i purchased one and tried it ... and LOVED it, it feels so comfy on and stays in place, so i purchased more ... and when i saw it for $6.50 at amazon, what a BARGAIN, i purchased a few more ... i paid double the amount for them at stores .. 
This is a lovely shawl, extremely well-crocheted. I am surprised at receiving this level of quality for the price. It is smaller than one would think from viewing the photograph 
I love these! They are very comfortable. The lace is stretchy so it is comfortable. I ordered 3 different pairs. I love the bright colors. I'll probably order more. I love them 
These are the BEST panties I've ever had! They don't ride up, they feel like they are not even there and they don't cut into your skin! They are so smooth that my jeans don't pull them up either! If you're tired of digging your panties out, even the victoria secret's barely there panties, buy these! They are much cheaper here on Amazon than at Beall's department store. I paid $11.99 for 3 pair at the store. 
This is one of the nicest blouses I have ever bought.Fits great and looks great 
I got a pair of dickys coveralls and this jackit is all I need to keep warm on any cold day at work outside 
My son was delited to see the package arive so quickly. He was happy with the grafics and quality of the shir 
Loved the shoe and especially loved the price! Very comfortable and goes with anything 
I bought these because I needed some basic black flats that I could wear often. The great thing is they didn't need to be broken in, and they were comfortable as soon as I started wearing them, since the leather is really soft. But, this also means it is more prone to scratches and scuff marks, so be careful when wearing them (mine have small rough patches at the toes just after wearing them 2-3 times, but I walk a lot). They're really comfortable to wear throughout the day, but not too breathable, so wear some shoe liners with them. Overall, I really like Steve Madden shoes and these were a great buy. 
I ordered 1/2 a size larger than what I normally wear, they are very comfortable, but I could have ordered them in my normal size. Very nice looking 
The clutch was very well made and attractive. It served the purpose well 
Bought this bag for my daughter who was a bridesmaid this summer. It matched the silver shoes she wore and was large enough to fit some makeup, her cell phone and her keys. She will definitely use this bag again. Very reasonable price 
These are a beautiful pair of pumps. I love the tailored look I can wear with them: trousers and a vest. You get not just the ribbon ties as seen in the picture but also regular cord ties, though I think the ribbon is much more attractive. The only complaint I have about these pumps is that there isn't a lot of padding inside, so as the day went on my foot would rub back and forth in the front and cause some friction. Other than that they are wonderful 
These shoes have a nice look, but run almost half a size larger. I'm a 9.5M and the 9 fits better 
The shoes look as good as they did in the photo. They are very comfortable and can go with any outfit 
These shoes are quite comfortable now, but they took about two weeks to break in properly. In the beginning, I actually was considering returning them because of how uncomfortable my feet were by the end of the day. I'm glad I kept them, though - they look good, they're comfortable (now), and they're definitely made well. Other reviews have mentioned that these shoes don't look exactly like the picture, which is true - they are a little bit darker and have a fair amount of scuffing and marking done by the manufacturer out of the box, but I purchased these expecting them to be like that. I'm satisfied with them, to be sure, even with the initial rough period 
I found the shoes to be pretty much what I'd hoped for, a pair for everyday use that had a certain style and comfortable feel. The shoes have a scruffy look, which works for me. I like them 
Shoe was as described. And for a stylish pair, it was well worth the price. Free S/H and No Tax charged was a great added feature 
These shoes arrived quicker than I imagined (next day, when I only have prime 2-day shipping), and fit great. They are comfortable, and they are still great today, 2 months later. The only problem is that the shoes aren't the same color as the ones in the picture. The picture depicts it as a whiter shade, while in reality they are much browner. But don't let the color difference mislead you - these shoes are well worth the money 
this shirt looks like i,ve made it myself.very simple printing and the quality of the shirt is not so nice either 
Been wearing them for about 10 years now - never liked the feel of briefs. Hanes boxers fit feel great. They are nice and baggy with plenty of leg seat room. They also last a long time hold up well in the washer. My only advice is to size-UP when you order. I got a 34 waist only wear size LARGE. Med is too snug . Hanes boxers are classic comfort for the guy that has to feel some slack in the sack 
Total classic, white boxers. Fit great, not too trim, not too baggy. Maybe a little pricier than the Windham Pointe stuff, but a lot better manufactured. No waist-band hip-fatigue lines at the end of the day, wife loves them -- can't go wrong 
I love wearing boxers. They are the best stop wearing those things and wear boxers. Boxers are the best and the chicks love them 
I have been wearing Boxers for 2 years and i never stop wearing them. They are sexy looking. I use them for wearing underneath my pants, walking around the house in, and sleeping in. I sleep in boxers and a t-shirt. Those wimpy boys who don't wear boxers you better start wearing them. The way to look cool wearing them are going to a sleep over and sleep in them ok 
I have been using Hanes brand boxers for years and I swear by them. The material is light and does not cling to the thighs. The basic design has the seams running up the cheeks of the bottom not up the centre. This prevents the boxer from clinging to the centre of the behind. The boxers are durable and remain wearable for many years. Note that the front flap can stay open after continuous use and should be pressed to retain that `closed' look. Color selection is somewhat minimal. A 3-pack usually has 2 of one color when there should be 3 different colors/patterns. Why Buy: As your `main' line of boxers - practical for everyday use. You want to see your man looking sexy even after many washes 
My new boxers arrived 5 days ago and I've been wearing them non-stop! They look good, give your boys total freedom and don't restrict in any way. I can't express how much I love boxers, the best style by far, and these are a comfortable, quality pair. Next time I see my boyfriend, I'll definitely be wearing these to show them off. I just know he'll want a pair for himself 
This camo t-shirt was exactly as represented. The only reason for the lack of a 5th star is because I thought that they should have listed in the description that the shirt runs small so order big, or to let us know it was sized for Juniors. Thank goodness I ordered XLARGE! 
I am extremely happy with my jeans and they fit great! Price was fantastic and the seller was one of the best 
I received this item after having placed it on my wish list....not knowing that it does NOT work with my cell phone. Your phone must have a place to put a handle strap on it---which is how this charm attaches. There is no alternative to attaching it so I put it on a purse instead 
These slacks feel so good. You can't go wrong. I love them 
this hat really wasn't quite what i'd expected...i thought i was purchasing a winter-y sort of knit hat, and it turns out that the front fabric of the hat is actually quite thin, and the back of the hat is that trucker cap type of mesh material. i didn't even notice it in the picture at all, they seemed to angle the hat in the photo so you don't see the mesh back. anyway, it's still a cute hat, i'm just not sure it's worth the money i'd paid for it after discovering what it's really like 
This is a great buy. The tie is good quality, and just as advertised. It arrived promptly and in good shape. I'd definitely buy more of the same type. 
In response to Amazon asking for a review on these shorts, here it is. They're shorts. Not much more I can say about them. They are a little comfortable but nothing to write home about 
Used all summer long almost everytime i was outdoors. Has held up well so far and has a really cute design. it was shipped very fast. Thanks 
There are very few options for small figures (32A), and what is available generally doesn't fit me well. This minimally constructed design works and is very comfortable. When I find something that works and is difficult to find I buy multiples because from my experience, the manufacturers will eventually discontinue it (much to my disappointment and outrage) 
I am an adolescent boy named William. As part of my puberty, I have gynecomastia, which means my breasts are large like girls. My mother bought me this bra to wear to school and at home. My breasts were supported, felt comfortable, and nobody was able to see my bra. I really like wearing this 
I ordered this item one month ago and still haven't recived JACK!!!! 
Look great and fit well. Comfortable and certainly make a statement. I would recommend them. 
These trunks offer the support of a brief and the comfort of a boxer-brief with minimal coverage - Great undertwear 
I have enjoyed my new reef sandals. I heard about them from my sister-in-law. I found some cheaper on Amazon, and decided to buy them. I will be buying a black pair in the future 
Love these! Fit is very true to size. They are super comfortable- nice arch 
These are great shoes, very comforatble, and break in quickly. I'm not sure why some folks are getting shoes that were made in India; mine are clearly marked on the sole, and inside the shoe, "Made in Italy". I deducted one star, as the soles started "chunking" the first couple of days I owned them. While some may say this is normal, I've been wearing leather soles for decades, and this is the first time I've seen actual divets in the leather from 2 days worth of wear. Overall, I do recommend them though. 
Beautiful black leather and deerskin shoes that are of the quality you'd expect from Bostonia. An amazing price as well 
Prompt delivery. Excellent service. Shoes were exactly like they were described. Love the shoes! 
I have worn these shoes for over a year. They wear well and have never been uncomfortable. An excellent value overall 
This is a nice looking comfortable shoe. I have used this shoe on business interviews and a wedding so far and have found the shoes to be very comfortable. If I had to buy this shoe over again, I would do so in a heartbeat 
Good service and a great deal. Will do business again! Beautiful shoe 
i purchased several pairs of jersey leggings in different colors...they are everything i expected...great colors...wash up beautifully...fit as wanted...the delivery was fast...i do not have any complaints as all and i will definitely order again from this company.. 
This shoe is perhaps the best pump I've purchased in a long time. The quality is fantastic. Unisa makes a great product and Amazon provided a fantastic price... what more can I say 
The only reason that they are not 5 stars is that the zipper is cheap. A heavier duty zipper the easily slides would make these pants perfect. Everything else about these pants are well made and comfortable, a good buy 
These are terrific pants -- they are soft with a good feel to your hands and very comfortable. They also look great and the pockets are just where you need them, very convenient for carrying anything you need with you. I don't know if brown is really the new black, but these are a great color -- they are not your grandfather's brown! I also own the khaki and will probably order the black or olive from Captain Dave next. 
a great bag, nice leather, beautiful shade of brown. I love the size and design, as it was what I was looking for. Arrived fast. There's a few scratches on it already from using it. I'm not the most gentle on things, but not rough. the buckles on it are not solid metal, they're like hollowed out. That would be my only complaint or disappointment. Great for the price, perfect size to supplement your purse to work 
Ths is a great shoe. I bought it for wearing while walking on or near beaches, but it looks so good, I often wear it in completely dry places. 
A picture did not show all the beauty design and the confort, I will buy more of this kind 
it's a comfortable formfitting t-shirt dress. whenever i wear it, i get compliments 
The socks come in two sizes, regular and king. I now get the king, but I used to get the regular ones. I have a wide foot with a high arch that is usually a 13 but can range from 12-14 depending on the shoe. The regulars fit, but the kings fit better. I hate socks that gouge my calf (I run). These stay up without digging into my skin 
I didn't actually buy these socks because there was no way to select the size. The only "size" shown was simply "over the calf", which to me isn't a size at all -- it's a length. Since feet and calves grow to all different lengths and thicknesses, one would have to be pretty foolish to order a sock with no indication of size. Hence only one star and no sale! Better luck next time, Jos A Banks 
Shearling is cushier and the laces are thin patently pseudo rawhide. Nonetheless these slippers are comfortable, light weight and good looking. If they only last a couple of years and need a spenco insert for better padding, they are still a bargain. Would (will) buy again anytime 
excellent house shoe that is able to be worn outside if needed. Would buy agai 
I ordered these as a gift for my son. The quality was great and the price was right. We were both pleased with the purchase. I chose amazon to purchase through because I have had so much success finding what I want at prices I like on their site 
I have purchased many pairs of slippers and these are by far the nicest. I have paid much more for a lot less quality. The shipping was prompt all in all it was a very easy transaction 
I purchased these slippers for my son as a Christmas present. The stitching ripped through the suede after ond day of wear. I am very disappointed 
I can't believe the bargain I got with these slippers. I ordered one pair and as soon as I put them on I came back and ordered the last two pairs they had in my size. It is so difficult to find quality slippers with a wide width but these are PERFECTION. Well made, comfortable, nice looking, I would even wear them to run to the store (gosh does that sound like some grandfatherly thing or what). They are sharp looking and comfortable. What more can you ask 
I ordered these last week for myself,and they were so wonderful to read with and so light on your nose, that my Husband took them for his drawings to take-off job bids. So I am back today buying me another pair. We recommend them for anyone wanting to read. And who doesn't want to read? LH/Texa 
very well pleased with this purchase. Recommend it to all those interested in purchasing this product 
Superb product. Excellent service and fast shipping. Reasonably priced. Highly recommend this vendor. Thank you 
What a GORGEOUS color. This tie looks fabulous on my husband with a blue and white striped dress shirt. LOVE it 
Thank you so much for the speedy delivery they came in time for the rehearsal dinner. I loved the red silk neck ties and they really made all the ushers stand out. They made very nice thank you gifts. We were all pleased. marjorie300 
Fit and feel are unsurpassed. Great material and workmanship . I'm usually clean shaven and the silky material of these panties against my skin is very sensuous and makes me feel very sexy. If you like retro lingerie, you'll love these 
love the way these panties fit! they last wash after wash and look so pretty. feel great under jeans or dress. highly recommend 
lovely fit well, very smooth under clothing 
I really love this bag. It was perfect size for traveling around theme parks, however the company sent me 3 duplicate bags by mistake and made a huge inconvenience to myself to send them back. They also took 4 days longer than expected to get it to me.Other than that it was great 
At least the one I recieved for Christmas just simply does not work! OK so now I have to figure out how to return it... this was a gift that came from out of my household, but none the less I was given the receipt. However if you call the 1-800 number all you get is a recording that says if you leave a name and number they will get back to you by tomorrow or... go to their website and see instructions for return. This was ordered from Amazon so I don't have "Their" web address!!!! Hmmm FYI 
I really like this travel clock ~ lightweight, sturdy, compact even tells the temperature! I really like that it displays the alarm clock time also - and shows whether or not the alarm function is on...even shows when it is on snooze ~ snooze is about 4-5 minutes, there is an indiglo light bar - which is the same as the snooze bar located across the top of the clock - very convenient and easy to find! The clock and alarm are very easy to set and you can go up or down so you don't have to scroll through the whole sequence to get back to your time...setting hour and minutes separately. All of the buttons beep when pressed - even the light/snooze button - but that is minimal compared to all of the great features and conveniences~ it is a quick beep and much less loud than others i have tried (for less beeping you can hold down the button for automatic scrolling when setting the time). I highly recommend this travel clock! Enjoy your travels 
For the price of this suit I was expecting something of okay quality and was plesently suprised when I recieved it. The fabric feels good and seems to be a good quality. This suit would be perfect for ANY occasion my son may need a black suit. If you need a specific color tie though you may want to order it seprately. It came with a black tie even though the picture I ordered from showed a red tie and the product descripiton doesn't specify color. If your wondering how fast they ship out-I ordered it priority on Sunday and recieved it thursday 
What i was most impressed with, was the fact that the sizing provided was accurate. The suit fit my son perfectly 
I bought these in black and really like them. They're a great alternative to sandals with all the little holes really airing out the feet. I have gotten so many compliments on them. I love that I can wear them with just about anything and they go. I even wear them with my workout clothes when I go to Pilates since they're easy to slip on and off. The only issue I have with them is that I sometimes feel a little lopsided walking in them. They're the only shoes I've ever had that make me feel like that...almost as if the bottom of the right shoe is crooked or something. I still wear them all the time though and would buy them again 
Wash up with no problem. I wear a 7 and a large fits just right 
This is the gift to give the women in your life who can appreciate comfort and classic style. Cushioned inner soles, sturdy bottom soles, soft and beautiful upper material, no pressure points, perfect fit, warm, classic style that goes with pajamas and jeans, stands up to machine washings--what more can you ask from a house shoe? Give yourself the gift of these slippers, too, in every color. 
Plush, soft terrycloth fabric with padded inner sole cushion make these very comfortable. Elastic around the ankle and a rubber sole make these versatile enough to wear out-doors (i.e. taking out the trash) 
Item is well made and holds up great. Was shipped quickly 
Items were just as ordered. They are well made and hold up very well. Shipment was received quickly 
I have always worn Olga bras. Being "small" in size, I have had a fit problem. I hate Underwire, but like a padded bra. Olga has always made a bra that combines both of my needs. I'm sorry this style has been discontinued, but I'm looking forward to trying the replacement 
Well, I live in Texas...i can't ski very often...however, I slipped on this pair of socks and got a running start at a freshly waxed wood floor and relived the '69 winter olymipcs! It was great...oh, and they're really soft and fuzzy and feel really good on my feet, too 
Finally a great quality hooded sweatshirt in 6x for under $60. Love the fleece lining and fit. Perfect. Back ordering more 
Just like other Russell products. My husband is over 400 lbs., and tall. Not all tall clothing is as long in their tops as Russell is. Of course this is not a zip-up. A pull-over is not supposed to zip up. It is not a heavyweight, but both my husband and I like them. In fact I came back to this site to buy some more. In tops for my big and tall husband, we only want Russell. 
These are the greatest pair of flip flops. Great little price on them too!. Super fast on the shipping. You will enjoy these!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This outfit was absolutely adorable. I bought a nine month for my 6 month old grandson and it was a little tight. I would buy the next size up because it runs a little small. 
This item is out of this world my grnadchildren wore them for a birthday party and everyone has to turn to make some great comments about the outfits both looked awsome.. Congratulation 
This is the best sunglasses I ever had ,especially for this price! I got so many compliments,especially on WMC week in Miami which was really surprising cause everybody is so stylish over there ,so it's really worth it 
I bought the glasses as a gift and the individual is enjoying them. 
you really can't find a better value for sunglasses this sweet, besides it gets me the ladies just fine. i liked 'em so much i bought a pair for all my friends 
i love this sunglasses!they're just the ultimate rock n roll sungalsses you're lookin' for 
These sunglasses are a great value for a great look. I've bought several pairs of them for others and they love them too 
I don't spend a lot on sunglasses because I destroy them regularly. I bought these as they were in the right price range for a "disposable" item. These are as good as you can expect for this price. They are relatively well made out of decent grade materials. They were a little tight on me, so I bent them out a touch, and now they are comfortable. These are a good value 
I am very pleased with these sunglasses. They fit very comfortably and I have been wearing them constantly. The glasses do not fall off if I should bend down to pick up something. They provide a comfortable shield from Mr. Sun when he is at his peak during the day. And the best part is that price I paid for these glasses was very reasonable 
i've gone through my fair share of aviators, but these are by far the nicest ones i've owned for under $20. thanks 80's purple! 
Well, I cannot speak for the previous commentor, but I have worn these for about 5-8 years. Yes, I have kept a pair that long! They haven't worn out at all. Of course, my underwear are much older, so the tag is in the back and says "Life". Life is by Jockey, but now that brand is exclusive to men's underwear. I plan on looking for these again at a store and trying them again. Well, so now I don't know how valid my review is because it's been so long, but the ones I do have are amazingly comfortable and I hope these live up to that 
I love these shoes! I just ordered the brown ones and I am going to order the black ones. They are so comfortable I would recommend them to anyone. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing them I got a compliment 
It took 2 weeks after I ordered the hat for the company to even ship it. I recieved it after the arrival date. When I did finally recieve it turns out that their idea of a large is everyone else's small. 
This shirt feels very confident and sexy. Its business/ style. Very good look. 
These pants come cut to Spec., easy to fit. They are very well made and have held up well through many wearings and Dry Cleanings. Highly Recommended 
I'm all about buying pretty things, but this pretty thing pretty much don't work the way you'd want. While the iPod Nano is in the case, neither outlets on the bottom are accessible-- more importantly, the headset jack. 
They are soft and comfortable. Tehy feel like I put in inserts inside my shoe. These are great and cost less 
I will wear nothing but this bra - it is comfortable and it looks great, no matter what I wear it under. I bought it a few years ago in several colors and practically lived in it and, get this: I grew an entire cup size, bought the same bra in my new size, and I STILL love it 
I have one of these in every color and wear nothing else. The perfect bra if you want to make the cup-size you have look great, not bigger. So comforatable too 
I'm sure every figure is different but this bra is one of the few I've found that I would buy again. In fact, I would go out of my way to buy this bra. The fit is excellent and the look under t-shirts or clingy fabric is smooth and flattering. Furthermore, it is comfortable 
I was very pleased with this jacket. The style is wonderful! I found it to be true to size, but the arms were a little snug. It was a fabulous price! It is a definite keeper 
I am thrilled with this lined, suede jacket with oversized, decorative grommets! The fit was perfect - I got a "small" and I usually wear size 6-8 Petite. Looks great with jeans or dress pants 
Love the product - great workmanship, fun to wear, nice find on Amazon. Thanks for the great jacket, Brandon 
I love the look of this jacket. It is a little smaller than marked 
It's really original, I got a lot of complements and it's nicely made jacket. It goes excellent with the Brandon Thomas Women's Yolkster Skirt. 
Incredible deal on this soft, nicely made jacket that goes with just about everything in my closet. I took the suede ties off and it "hangs" just right without them. Equally nice with jeans or skirts. This one works, ladies! The large fits me fine, I'm 5' 9" and weigh about 130 
A fun, lightweight suede jacket. It is 100% leather and requires professional cleaning. I bought the peridou which is not as vibrant as pictured but is still a versatile, multi-seasonal color. I usually wear an 8 and ordered a Medium which fit perfectly in length and width, even through the arms. At just under twenty dollars, this jacket adds color and flair to a variety of outfits 
You cannot go wrong at this price! I agree with the other reviewers who wrote that the sleeves/arm holes/shoulders were a bit snug. I own a few other Brandon Thomas suede tops in size Small, so that's what I had ordered but I ended up returning it for a Medium. In this particular jacket I preferred the fit and ease of the Medium. FYI the suede ties are just looped through the grommets so you can adjust or remove as you wish 
What a waste of money. I bought this for my wife and there is nothing good to say about it. It's so big that she has to hold it up to keep the string touching her body. The "bubbles" get stuck between the cheeks, and she says it does absolutely nothing for her where it's supposed to. She said that it was actually irritating to wear. Don't waste your money on this 
I'd rather give this a -.5 stars than a full one star off because the only fault I could find was that the pearls are more like cheap plastic beads one might find on a Marti Gra necklace. Not very realistic. Other than that, the material was super stretchy and soft and the beads fit me in all of the right places ; 
I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005. We have other sex toys, some we like (Pyrex) but most are a disappointment. As they can be expensive and are lacking in quality. So I thought for the $12 or $15 how bad could these be? Well let me tell you. Not only do they look super HOT on my wife. But they feel GREAT! She loves wearing them when we make love! When I give her oral I run my tongue over the beads and she loves it! And I really like the way they feel during intercourse too. The best bang for the buck. Pun intended. :) Enjoy! Not using my real name so my wife does not get mad 
This is the best thing i've ever seen. I love the string of bubbles so much i tried them on while my wife was at work. 5 stars easy! HOT! However, perhaps a better view of the product could help amazon customers choose the item. I know i'd love to see it and that it would probably have made us make the decision much quicker. In the words of our teenage son this product is "dope" 
I love how the great the pearls feel on me and am glad I bought these. A sexxy thing for sur 
Not too tight, not too loose. Nice material. It's so freakin' hard to find decent men's yoga shorts. Only problem is the waistling rides a little high. Much better than Prana shorts which are unnecessarily baggy 
I found that the most useful way to wear this product was under my maternity pants to help keep them from sliding down my increasingly round belly. I didn't like wearing it over my pants at all. I found that after sitting down or even walking awhile, my pants would slide down my belly and the bella band would roll up my belly. There were alot more clothing adjustments in public when I was wearing it over my pants 
I wasnt to sure about spending the $$ on this item at first, but when i got it in the mail and put it on, it was a life saver, no more maternity jeans!! I am still abel to fit in my regualr jeans, but i just cannot zip or button them up, and that is where the Bella Band comes in, it work wonders, no body can believe that i am still in my regualr jeans!!!! Thanks Bella Band!! Wendy L 
Bealls really delivers with these navy pants-it's so hard finding elasticized cotton knit pants that look good-and these fit the bill 
The skin is soo soft. The gloves are very comfortable and I will come back again to rate them after I try them in snow. The only thing I wish to be different is not to have made the mistake with the color. I bought the dark brown ones by mistake, while I wanted to by black ones 
I like this shoe very much. Soft and supple. Seems wide, but still fits my size 
These are very cute and comfortable shoes, and look great with jeans or dressed up. I have wide feet and they were very accommodating- I wouldn't recommend them for narrow feet though. 
love these shoes! very comfortable and stylish. i have a bunion on my left foot and finding flat shoes that fit is very difficult. i wore them all day, taking my children out and the shoes didn't pinch at all. highly recommend them, especially at the sale price! 
Very comfortable. Doesn't fall off your feet like other similar clog-like slippers. I bought these to replace an old pair of Dearfoam slippers I bought more than 6 years ago that finally wore out. Definately a long life for such a good price. Found that they run a bit small. Ordered a Large which I found out was for sizes 8-9. Returned for an X-Large (9.5-10.5) which was a better fit. I typically wear either a 9 or 9.5. Also are a bit narrow, which works good for me, but not ideal to wear with thick socks. 
I liked them so much I just had to get more (for now and the future 
As far as socks go these were pretty good. The vacuum packaging was good for a laugh 
My husband loves these socks. They are a little pricey however they are super soft and comfortable. My husband hates those skinny thin dress socks for work so these do a much better job, and since he seems to be in work clothes a lot his feet are always comfy 
My husband loves these socks. They are very cushy - can't find them locally anymore. Please continue to carry them. Thanks 
My husband can't stand cotton sox and we finaly found Acrlic extra custioned toe and heal here at Amazon.com. They are great and we will be purchasing 4 pair every month. Please don't discontinue this brand they were just to hard to find anywhere. Thank you, Kerri 
I bought two of these shirts for work, and they seem to be holding up great after over a month of frequent washing and drying. The size was accurate and the shirts fit well. 
Beatifull, Nice, Fancy!! This is a very good quality item. The only thing I would say about it, is that it has little details is the leather strap. I had to apply some glue on it, but its perfectly now 
Great PJ. Really glad i got it. It's pretty well built. I was afraid it would be a bit fragile, but so far so good. As a reference, I'm 6'0" with roughly 200lb... I got the Large, and it's a bit tight for my taste... I'll be trading it for the X 
These silk pajamas, in my opinion, have much higher quality stitching, tailoring details, as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas. Sizing Help: To help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L. I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently. I am 6'0" and weigh 175. My suit measurements are a 42" chest, 34" sleeves, and 32" pants inseam. The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short. The Large was the best fit overall, although roomier around the chest than I would prefer. But if you are my size the Large is your best option. 
These are great . Well made, did ok in the wash. They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x . They are still cool enough for summer, but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT !!!!!! By a pair for your wife,yourself They are heaven 
I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well. My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them. I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect. I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite. (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect! :) My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever. The size is perfect, color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past. I can't find anything I don't like about these. I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least. Ja 
This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount. Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though 
What a great pair of pajamas these are. So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging. I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays. Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored. I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine 
The cotton is soft and lightweight. The elastic waistband isn't too tight, though tight enough the drawstrings serve no purpose other than for looks. My only complaint is the pants are a bit too short, but I often have this problem because I'm 5'7 
These are the most comfortable things I have ever worn on my feet; I bought them for Halloween and I'm so happy that I did; They are my new house shoes. But just in case you didn't know: the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper; So you have to sew them into the front- I'm assuming for proper fit; This is a bit annoying- coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front(no good if your terrible at sewing like me); And they soil easily;This should be expected of course(especially if they are white). Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially if your house is carpeted; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose 
Although I am not a professional ballet dancer (it has been some 15 years since I've had my last ballet class), recently I have decided that I needed some exercise, so I started to take ballet classes again. Consequently, I purchased the S1C Canvas slippers and I must say I do not regret it. The slippers are soft, delicate, and fit like a glove: a ballerina's "dream partner" 
Sansha S1C still stands as the best all-around canvas ballet slipper. Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use. Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles- especially through mail order- Sansha styles, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care. The only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time. If you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt, you may want to scuff the soles once a week. Washing does not seem to clean the leather as well as the canvas, and eventual buildup will impede turns 
Dear sir, I think that you can not understand me. Still I am waiting my goods. I will check it after receiving my goods. I wait nearly one month and pay double price. I saw that prices are discounted. I am living in Turkey and when I purchase some goods from Cabelas, ll Bean or Sierra Trading Post, I receive max after 4 days. But in your systemI am still waiting becouse goods will go to NJ and my friend repack and transport to me. Today I contacted with him and thereis no news from my goods. He is working in fedex. I have no any bad things about Amazon or Bargain Outfitter, or Guide Gear companies. But I can not understand your system. I must purchase something from a/m companies and receive it max after 5 days. Another sample last year (12.12.2006) I had purchased some shoes from JC Penney company and goods will came same way (to NJ and To TR) and I am still waiting. I wisited USA several times since 1960 and I can not beleive it. This is last sample. I want to purchase some decoys from company "Mack's Prairie Wings" but they can not ship directly to Turkiye. But this not end of every thing. I will purchase some goods from Amazon for timeless (i.e. necessary for next year) goods but When I need urgent I will prefere speed companies. Thanks alot kind interest. Best regards. Bahadir Yamalioglu 
These are excellent for wearing as around-the-house leggings, or under clothes during cold Midwestern winters. I'll probably get another pack too 
I know it says that they are not meant to be PJ's but I use them for that on my daughter as well as to put on her with a large t-shirt. These are great even to use under their regular clothes in winter. They are priced great too. When I ordered them I was not going to use them but for fall wear but now I may buy some more for the winter as well. This store is great on shipping also I ordered them regular shipping and got them in just a few days. This may depend on where you are in the USA as to how fast you get them. As far as I am concerned you cannot beat this price and versatile ways to use these cute little pants 
Of the Love Fifi items my husband recently bestowed upon me, this was the third item I had tried on. My other-half had selected the Black Red version for me (the one pictured) -- which made it easily one of the most romantic of the bunch! After a nice dinner out and once we got home -- I told my husband that I wanted to change into something more "comfortable." When he came into the bedroom, I had slipped on these Jezebel crotchless panties along with my sexiest black negligee. I was also sprawled across the bed - with the most alluring come-hither look I could muster. (Hey, don't laugh! It still works!) I wasn't sure if lightning would strike again. Buy hey! With these Love Fifi's centerless panties -- I'm definitely three-for-three! For some reason, I had assumed that these (and other) crotchless knickers would have little appeal between women. But when a close girlfriend came to visit one weekend - I soon learned otherwise! I hopped under the sheets - with these Jezebels on, unbeknownst to her - to help warm her bed. After getting reacquainted -- she playfully tried to slip her hand underneath - but I kept shooing it away! This went on for about ten minutes, until it finally dawned on her - that there was another way in! This was, incidentally, about ten minutes LONGER than my husband - or any guy, for that matter - would've taken to figure it out! Surprisingly, I never would've guessed - that these Love Fifi crotchless undies would be so versatile! Everyone loves `em! 
I have to say that after wearing these for a day that they did not disappoint. I love the boy short look of these crotchless panties that are made in the USA. They are made out of nylon so thin and wispy that it feels like you don't have anything on at all. And boy do they look good. I just can't get enough of looking at myself in the mirror. This weekend I'm hosting a lingerie party and I'll definitely be singing praises about these panties that let you show just enough throw to really titalate. These panties are so comfortable, you don't even know you have them on. Do you get the picture that I really like them 
I love crotchless panties! They're airy and sexy. Hmmmm, next to being pantyless...Why a 4? Because I prefer absorbent material, you know. Anyway, these are nice for those special occasions. 
I looked for a long time for some cordovan colored penny loafers. Finally found these. They fit great and the price was right 
I received 50% refund on returning the product in original condition since I did not like what I received. Why such a high deduction? You should require merchant to post the refund amount when ordering. I also paid for shipping the product back thus resulting in only 25% refund of what I paid originally. 
I saw these shoes at Macy's yesterday for $36. They only had the red. IMO, the red is a bright, clown red. It's not a bad red, it's just a true red with no subtlety. I almost considered getting them, but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent, pointy toe skimmer. I am *so* glad Macy's did not have the black because I got them thru Amazon for $22. I believe the shoe fits true to size. I am a 7.5M, period. In pointy shoes, I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid pointys altogether. I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8, but I tried on the 8 at Macy's and it was too big. I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model, but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big. I ordered recvd a 7.5M. When I recvd the shoes today and put them on they were snug. Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way. They just fit exactly to my foot. This is a leather upper and not man made. So the patent looks black and shiny! It's not cheap looking at all. The point comes to a nice triangle and isn't exagerrated. Given that they are leather, I expect them to stretch a little to my feet. The shoes measures 10.5" from the point to the middle of the heel. The point to the top of the shoe is 3" and there is 1" between my big toe and the point. There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather, it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them. I have experienced that already just walking around the house. The shoe looks low cut on the sides, but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking. I'll be watching to see if I end up with a line/bend across the front of the shoe. By the time that happens -- if it ever does -- I will certainly have gotten my $22 out of them. And finally, I am 5'2" and I tend to avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skis. These shoes are great because they elongate my leg and don't create a costume-y look. They look great peeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w/the new capri leggings I got the other day. Highly recommended! 
i absolutely love these shoes they are super cute and look good with basically everything the only sad part for me is that ive got fairly long toes (as my boyfriend tells me) so the tips arent at a perfect point because the shoe has formed on the side to my toe 
But, they run kinda small. Order 1/2 size up. Why isn't there a 9 1/2 
I absolutely reccommend these. They are comfortable, well constructed, and the cut is sexy...pointed toe, but with a wide enough toe box and soft enough leather to reshape a good amount to your foot. The side cut is perfect, its dressy yet can be worn with shorts or jeans also. I highly reccommend these flats! - Abigai 
These shoes are an amazing bargain ... and there isn't a catch! They look and feel terrific. They seem true to size to me. The black leather pair is your basic versatile flat in the fashionable and streamlined pointy toe style. My shoes just arrived today, so I can't tell you how they'll hold up over time, but I'd highly recommend taking advantage of this $18 deal while it's still available 
Hey, I'm bw a size 6 and 61/2 and I ordered the 61/2 and it was still a little tight. I'm going to see if I wear them long enough if they'll stretch. These were such a good deal I couldn't order a bigger size. I've been waiting for these to go on sale all season, so even if they are a little small I really need black flats so I'm gonna wear them 
I have two pairs of these. They are extremely comfortable, look great on my feet, and the price is right. Quality seems a bit flimsy and they may not hold up for long, but who cares? I may buy a pair in every color I can find 
I just received a pair of the MIA Hepburn black leather flats and I am thrilled. The leather is extremely soft. The shoe is stylish and can be worn with just about anything. I highly recommend these shoes so much that I'm going to purchase another pair! Ironically, my co-worker just bought a pair today 
This back pack is an excellent buy. I bought one for me and all my collegues wanted one. I packed it for a two weeks trip all loaded up and it did the job, pretty resistant and cool looks. The best part is the price 
One thing I want to stress about this backpack is how good it feels on your shoulders when you've got it loaded with a few books and your laptop. It feels like someone is standing in back of you suspending the weight off your shoulders. The pack sits high on you shoulders- stays there (no slipping or sliding) and keeps the weight off your lower back.  It's compact, slim, low profile, and yet plenty roomy enough to carry a few extra books. It's got two roomy main compartments, and a lot bigger than it looks gadget pouch area.  My main complaint is with the gadget pouch- it's not all that convenient to reach in and grab a pen or whatever, because the zipper scrunches up when you try to open the compartment. If I had to use this as my everyday backpack, rather than my laptop backpack I think I'd get rather annoyed with this.  But I primarily use it to transport my laptop and it does it better than I could have hoped it to. 
Very comfy backpack with well organized sections. Great value 
This Product is very good, the materials are tuff, and for 30 bucks that is really good. Laptop stays put in place and you have extra space for books and lots of other things 
I looked at many backpacks and many reviews on them. This is a great bag on the cheaper end of the spectrum. I find the pockets helpful and well designed. I'd read that the zippers were slightly difficult - they're that way because there's a rain flap on each!! Which I appreciate. The bag can cinch down nicely if you don't have much in it or expand well. And, the red is nice.. 
Heavy duty and very well made. Lots of storage compartments and the padding against your back makes it very comfortable to carry 
WITHOUT QUESTION THE BEST FITTING JEANS I HAVE EVER OWNED. MOST JEANS FOR SKINNY GUYS ARE USUALLY BIG IN THE REAR END OR WIDE IN THE LEGS. THESE ARE PERFECT. I'VE BOUGHT 3 PAIR IN DIFFERENT COLORS. GREAT 
My son is tall and thin, so it is hard to locate and purchase jeans that fit him at the local mall. I bought these slim leg jeans by levis for him and they fit wonderfully. He wears a size 26 waist and 30 length. That is impossible to find. 
Other than extreme lack of small waists in long inseams 31X36 these jeans out manuver any loose jeans I had (extremly nonbinding). I find them soft and extremly comfortable. Different from everybody elses and don't get hooked on bikes or motorcycles like boot cuts. love em tight maybe tighter super jeans please LEVI'S please make some in US 
I'm a skinny guy. Finding jeans that fit great is hard. But these fit great at a great price. They hug in all of the right places. Seriously, if you're skinny and want a pair of slim jeans, get these. They are amazing 
With the christmas calendar ticking down to zero-hour, I was in a time crunch to get these slippers for my daughter. I tried other websites (even the "Brand")to no avail, all were either wrong size or wrong color. I was extremely pleased to come to my trusted Amazon site and find these Indigo Tasman's in the correct size. Our whole family has this slipper, all in a different color and size, but all snuggly and toasty for our little cold feet - love them 
The string wasn't too much of a string. More like a strap... that hurt! I liked the Gregg Homme's Low Rise Pouch ALOT better! This would not be something I could wear except to pose for a few pictures and call it a day 
I WILL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN REAL SOON... THANK 
I Love this product, I really had a hard time finding a product like this in the stores. The material is very comfortable and the price is very cheap. I will be getting this product again in other sizes. 
I was hesistant to order products from this company based on other reviews about quality, but these are fantastic! I think they are better than the Gerber tank onesies, and certainly easier to get in larger sizes. They have a generous cut, and the 12-18 month size is perfect for my 15 month old daughter with very long torso, although she's nowhere near the weight stated on the package (about 10 pounds less) 
Great shirts, stay tucked in and long enough for a guy over 6 ft tal 
I ordered 3 different coin purses from Nvie. All are gorgeous! They are small, but I wanted them that way. The quality is fantastic. No one would EVER guess how little you paid for them. **UPDATE** I BOUGHT THIS PURSE WHEN IT WAS CLEARANCED AT $3.99 THERE IS NO WAY IT IS WORTH OVER $5 
I bought this for my wife and she was thrilled to receive it. It has great design and craftmanship. And at this price I think it's a steal. My wife has no idea how inexpensive this is :- 
Very nice quality as would be expected of the brand. Timely delivery. Thanks again 
I ordered this in aqua and was quite pleased -- the color and quality are great! If you think it may be too small, as one reviewer suggested, why not buy two? I love mine 
Just as advertised and worth the money. This is a hard item to find in local stores and the quality is excellent 
Great replica jersey, I expected it to be heavier, but actually like the fact that it was a bit of lightweight material. Some may or may not like that 
I bought these for my niece to wear in my wedding, and she absolutely loves them. In fact, my sister loves them too, so I may end up buying another pair 
This shoe is elegant, it's comfortable, the stacked heel is just right, the height is perfect and over all is a beautiful pair of shoe. I bought both colors that were available. Thank you. 
Once again an Internet business uses deception tactics for delivery times. The item said at the time of purchase, ships in 2 to 3 days, 15 days later I still have not received the item. 
This is the perfect size for kids taking snacks to preschool! The size in just right for a child that size to carry himself as the strap is too short for an adult. It even has a see-through name tag on the top where it isn't immediatly visible out in public 
I have been wearing Hard Tail roll down pants for years, thinking THEY were the top of the line, that is, UNTIL I purchased my first pair of AMMA. Was I wrong! AMMA is so much more durable. They don't fade out and thin out with repeated washings like Hard Tail. Don't let the extra cost mislead you into thinking AMMA is not the best buy. Just try your first pair. I promise you'll be hooked 
These shoes are made of top quality leather, are very comfortable all day, and versitle. Well worth the money 
This was packaged well and worked great. Well worth the price. Mine came from myGearStore and it was great quality. I guess get it from them, not the other sellers 
As soon as I put the case on it ripped! Then I contacted the seller and after a BIG hassle they sent me a different case. When the Case arrived it was already broken. Now I am stuck with 2 broken ipod cases. I would strongly recommend not buying from this store 
This case was such a great price, I could not resist. My Gear Store got the item to me fast, and the my iPod looks great in it! 
I love this shoe. I want one pair in every color 
I usually have to search high and low for this brand, but it is always well worth it. These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Hanes or the likes. The cotton is amazing - these shirts seem to last forever, and after about three washes they feel like they were made to a mold of your body. I don't know what is different about them, but unlike cheaper tee's, they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts. If you haven't worn these before, you don't know what you're missing out on. The comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms. I really can't describe what a difference these shirts make to my day-to-day comfort. The only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by -- so once you're hooked you'll always want to have a few extras on hand. Highly recommended 
Haven't had the chance to use the umbrella yet but it looks to be sturdy 
My umbrella went to a wrong address in another state. It was returned to the vendor. He contacted me for help. The unbrella then was sent to the right address..he picked up the tab for all costs. The kind of people with whom I want to do more business 
This sturdy umbrella is easy to open and close and covers two people well even in a heavy downpour. The rounded handle is pleasant to hold--much nicer than the traditional hook-shaped umbrella handle. The umbrella's mid-size length and weight make it comfortable to pack or carry. It's a good product at a good price 
Most umbrellas handle a light rain well, but leave you with wet pants during heavy rains. This umbrella is essential equipment for keeping you dry during downpours. I use it for the walking part of my commute through Washington, DC thunderstorms and it performs like a champ. It's also big enough to cover two, allowing you to share your dry haven with a child, spouse, or co-worker. The auto-close is great for letting you close the umbrella in a heavy rain from the shelter of your car or cab. An auto open/close umbrella this size is very hard to find...in fact this is the only one I know of. Quality is good...I've had one for four years that travels with me regularly on my commute. Price at Amazon is great. 
This is a very nice umbrella. It is big enough to cover you without your legs getting drenched but also doesn't feel cumbersome 
Great support! Love the moisture wicking. Nice, smooth band that doesn't chafe 
These boots were well made, and so CUTE! Very trendy. Delivery was quick, and service was great. 
I was looking for a comfirtable peep toe pumps, and I am very happy with Jammin. Perfect combination of style, comfort and fit. NSleek and sexy!! No sore heels or toes, sturdy 4" heels, and wide choice of colors 
I really like this shoe. The only draw back is that the leather is not as soft as I would like. I think they will be perfect once they have been broken in 
Got an opportunity to use the rainsuit on fishing trip. Keeps you dry, but does not block the wind very well. Overall, good product for the price 
This is a great suit. High Quality and sized as expected. Received very quick 
This rainsuit works very well, especially the jacket. The water proofing is excellent and the price is decent. The only problem is that the pants are too long and it is hard to alter them since it would ruin the waterproofing. 
I wanted a rain suit for fishing that was inexpensive. I got both and a little more. The suit is really well made and is plyable. Good buy for the money 
I bought this rainsuit so that I could ride my motorcycle in all weather. It works great against the rain, and it is also the perfect outer shell during the rare freezing temperatures we get in Dallas 
Excellent price, shopped around online and at retail outlets around town. Good quality for price. Thankfully, I haven't needed much this season 
I have a son who works on a golf course, they work in all weather except lightning. He needed something to keep him dry and not tear easily. This has worked wonderfully well, others at work looking for the same. 
great cap real warm and fits well too bad the shipping costs as much as the ca 
birkenstocks won't be going out of style anytime soon. they are the shoes you wear forever. i have a pair that i've had for at least 4 years and they are still in good shape 
Accept no imitations, including Betula by Birkenstock. Nothing compares to these shoes, and they are well worth the price. Consider it an investment, because they will last for years. Despite what the other reviewer had to say, I consider them "in style" and predict they will remain so for years to come 
Best underwear out there. Once you enjoy the ease of the pouch, you'll throw out all your old underwear with the off-center vertical flies you have to dig for every time nature calls 
I never ever buy like these underwear before!! My husband was so happy to wear these boyshort underwear!! It was perfect in design and material too. Last week I ordered 2 boyshorts and before two days I also ordered 4 boyshorts and 1 pack has 3 shirts for my husband, and he was very happy with your collections. Thank you so much (Jockey) and I hope to keep the good collection and please don't change the material or design keep it as it is!! ... All the best .. Asma. 
Just recently bought the Army Trunk. Very comfortable cotton boxer brief. Compared to other brands I own, they are as good or better than CK, 2Xist. 
Similar in cuteness and comfortability to the bikini top, these boy brief bottoms are a welcomed mix and match collection. Although they run a little small, in my opinion, they are still a great deal 
I bought these gloves for my kids' Hallowe'en costumes (they both wanted to be terrorists). The older one now uses them to protect his hands while doing weight training at the YMCA. They are great as part of a costume. As he's only used them a few times for weight training, I'm not entirely sure how they'll hold up under the long haul in that capacity.. 
1- on time Delivery. 2- Exact size. 3- VERY VERY VERY comfortable. 4- Reasonable price. *** REALLY 5 STARS CHOISE ** 
They are comfortable and look exactly as shown. I did not notice but the stitching on the front is actually asymmetrical. Very comfortable 
The shoes are very comfortable and feel very well made. I find the sizing about a half size larger than marked, but not eough to make it a big deal; they also are on the wider side, which makes them very nice to wear. However, they started to squeak rather loudly after about two months of usage, which at times can be quite annoying 
High quality but a little bit pain on the back side if ware it for a very long walk 
I travel a lot on business, I was looking for a pair of shoes with formal looking but easy for me to pass security checkpoint at the airport. This one meets my requirements perfectly, and it's quite comforable just as my other Clark's shoes 
If you're like me, you enjoy quality footwear, but don't enjoy the lengthy breaking-in process that is sometimes required before a shoe starts to feel comfortable. That's why I love these shoes. They are comfortable right out of the box, and I can only imagine they will continue to become even more comfortable as they mold themselves to my feet. The hand-antiqued leather offers a nice texture that works equally well with dress pants/khakis or your favorite pair of jeans. They slip on easily, with no need for a shoe horn, and they stay on securely, without coming loose at the heel, as some loafers are prone to do. This is my first pair of Clarks and I'm very impressed so far with the high quality of the leather, the comfort, and the look. All in all, these shoes are great. I highly recommend them if you're looking for a versatile and comfortable loafer. 
I like it is what I expected. the ball is good and the video that comes with the ball make a good combination 
Although quick, using the 8 pound ball proves to be a tough short workout 
This is a nice upper body workout because you're constantly moving the ball in various positions that really work your shoulders. They also throw in static lunges for your buns and some short cardio bursts. I consider myself an advanced exerciser and the 8# ball really gives you a great toning workout and keeps your heart rate up 
This shirt is very cool, and a nice round-a-bout FY to those annoying twits that don't or can't take a hint! The shirt is comfortable, and fits well. It's not a heavy shirt so wearing it in the humidity of new england's summer isn't a bad thing! Definitely get one if you like the message. A really great shirt, I recommend one. Nothin' like a shirt with 'tude 
Nice product, great price, Fit the small Sony Sureshot cameras well 
Is cofashion and fresh, light and the combination of colors is cool . I recommend the product for everything 
We bought it for a Christmas gift. It was a big hit. It seems smaller than it is pictured but is a great sport purse for lose items such as a cell phone, makeup, and such 
Looking at the photos I wasn't sure about its quality, but as I was looking for a camo tee with long sleeves and couldn't find any other I decided to risk it. And I LOVE it. It's thin and clingy, but very soft and comfortable. It looks and *feels* great. I wasn't happy with some others things I ordered from Andrew Christian (mostly belts - cheap looking!, and gloves), but this tee is a ten. I would buy it again, and I probably should, seeing how I like to wear the one I have now 
My husband thought these were great. And we both like the stripes 
I have purchased these shorts before and I was very happy with them so I ordered more 
These shorts are comfortable - all cotton. Great for working out. I wish they had a lining, though 
Sturdy, trendy and colorful beach bag. Can be used for everyday aside from being a beach bag alone. Good size, roomy with good leather trim. Wish they come in more than 2 colors offered (blue and red). A must have bag 
The clear/colored picture of a rooster on this handbag...which you can't tell from the picture. Kinda weird 
I bought the Rosso with the nautical print on it. Price is rock bottom when compared to other Prada handbags on the Internet. I was thrilled with the size of this handbag when it arrived. It is very roomy! For instance, I put two large, rolled up beach towels in it to keep the shape until summer arrives and there's still room to spare! It is very nearly the size of a tote bag. Comes with a Prada insignia soft cloth bag to store your bag in when you're not using it and Prada COA card, just in case you ever decide to sell your bag. Prada plate is, as customary, affixed to one side of the bag and leather Prada tag sewn inside of bag, as well. I love this bag so much, I'm planning a cruise just to be able to take my bag somewhere it would look smashing. Now that is an impressive handbag 
This item came in a timely manner and I was satisfied with the item as well, the only con is that the shipper used the postal service instead of UPS on the shippin 
I bought these Boxer Briefs for my Husband, and he absolutely loves them. 
They're stylish too. I am wearing a pair now and feel totally at ease in them. The best pair of underwear I own, even if they seem quite expensive 
Thank you for your quick shipping. I have not been able to find this product locally and appreciate your wide selectio 
classic pump, comfortable, but size 7 is a little bit larger than a normal 7 
This is the shoe I have been searching for all my life. Beautiful and comfort like a house shoe. I am on my feet alot traveling and speaking and this shoe always looks classy, feels comfortable allowing me to focus on my speach not my achey feet. I liked them so much I purchased them in 6 colors and even got 2 pair of black leather in case they wear out and I cant find them again. 
I returned the item because it was not exactly what I was looking for 
I love Bandolinos to begin with, but these are one of the more stylish pairs I've seen. Even though they're pointy, they are extremely comfortable. The heel is just right, and they look great with pants OR skirts! They fit true to size, too 
Excellent craftsmanship and material quality. Only drawback is needs a little pressing after washing, others I have tried will be virtually wrinkle free 
I was excited to receive these Pants, Expensive for the quality and They ran way Too Large ,even after a good wash dry - the Return Policy States that they must be returned without washing , I have to have them Altered which ads more to the cost! I would like to have had them returned for a smaller size -I am a 4-6 so I went with the small , I was going by the size chart , I needed an extra Small ,beware the sizes run Larger . At any rate I now own them and I am sure that after modifications they will last a long time -the fit does not look at all like the Models fit on screen.She must be wearing an extra small.I am Disappointed , especially by thinking they would have a nicer fit then they actually had. They look Sloppy on - not Sexy or stylish. they will be Used for Yardwork only 
This is the second pair of these pants that I've bought and I now have them in black and olive green. My favorite thing about them is the way they slim my hips. I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so blousy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slimness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an XL. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style. They're perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I.D. in the pockets, while sending your carry-on or purse through the conveyor-belt security. I love these pants! 
It took so long for the item to arrive;but once they got here. The item was form fitting, comfortable, but the pant legs were way to extended(overly wide). Aside from the alterations, these pants were better than the regular army / navy store purchase. 
I have some of these and am currently ordering more. Forget very big, they run HUGE. I am also usually around a size 9, with a 25" waist and maybe 29" hips at the very most, probably more like 27" (despicably narrow, I know) and an extra small still rides low on me, and is baggy. These aren't for the size 0s, at any rate. Besides that, these are my favorite pair of pants I own. Yes, I'm wearing them as I write this. How sad is that? Anyway, these are very comfortable, durable, and I love the material 
I abolutely LOVE these pants! I own four pairs already, and I am currently about to order 4 more pairs. They run VERY BIG.... I am usually a size 9/10, and the size SMALL fits me perfectly (if you want a snug fit), and the MEDIUM is fine too if you want them baggy (three of my pairs are MED, which ride really low on the hip on me, my waist is about 30" and my hips are about 40", and as I said the size small is a nice snug fit, but still comfy, not uncomfortably tight). The 8 pockets are GREAT! They are so versatile, you can wear them to work (if you have a semi-casual environment), as they look great with a button down shirt or a cute little babydoll top, but they are also great for anything athletic you might do (I rollerblade and ride a bike pretty frequently and these are my favorite pants to wear). The drawstring waist is perfect so you don't need a belt and the drawstrings at the ankle are perfect to tie them up at the knee if you want a makeshift capri. I LOVE THESE PANTS 
I love Camouflage pants... This year they are suppose to be a big fashion statement.....These pants are wonderful....Good material and pattern... Draw string for the waist... They ride lower on your waist too...They run big..They are not skin tight by any means....They work for me, and can for you too....These are great...I might get a smaller size next time...I washed them and dried them and they did shrink some, but not much....I say get some... You will love them... !!!! 
This is a perfect combination of size and workmanship...if you want a credit card holder with money clip that doesn't bulk your front pocket, this works great 
This shoe looks better in person than indicated online. I love these shoes they look absolutely fabulous on. All of Carlos Santana's shoes are sexy, stylish and accentuate your legs 
Absolutely love these panties, my girlfriend looks so hot and playing with panties on is so much fun. great gif 
There is nothing that makes feel sexier than wearing a crotchless panty under your clothes. This wonderful piece of lingerie is comfortable enough to wear all day long, and yet look super sexy when revealed. Combine this with the Portrait Open Tip Bra, and you have the kind of outfit that will drive him crazy. I love playing the hottie in this panty, and highly recommend it to you 
As you can see from the picture. Rather than just having a disquised opening these are truely crotchless. Much the same as an open bra all you have down there is exposed all of the time. Not only does this look uber sexy for your man. It also feels great, the first time you feel the breeze under your skirt you feel naked. Obviously, the only person who knows is you. Makes me feel SO sexy! My only complaint would be that I now seem to be in a constant state of arousal, found myself driving home the other night absent mindedly slipping my hand up my skirt and having a little rub. Thank heavens for leather seats 
I got these for a lingerie party, but I think they are a little to risque for that, now that said, I wore these all day yesterday and boy did I feel oh so naughty. Of course nobody knew but me. Well, my hubby Jack found out after we put the baby to bed and let me tell you, he was pleased, so pleased I pleased him. These panties need to be hand washed and are made out of Nylon and Spandex. They are made in the USA and are tres elegant. You and your man will just love them to pieces 
My Crocs are extremely comfortable! I wear them to work, where I'm on my feet constantly, always feeling the support. I am already looking into getting the Mary Jane style 
I like PINK. These CROCs were Salmon colored. I use them but would have preferred a different color. Still they are comfy and make it easy to get up and go 
Love them!!! I bought a pair for my niece for Christmas. They are light, comfortable and surprisingly temperate. My feet are never too cold or hot. I now wear them everyday to work. If it is raining outside then I wear a different pair to the building and put them on as soon as I am in my office 
I love these shoes. I am a nurse and they are the ONLY shoe that my feet don't hurt in by the end of the shift. I even have plantar fasciatis in my left foot. I own several pairs. I would caution people that they tend to run a little large and try a pair on someplace locally before ordering to get correct size. 
Loved the shoes! Took them on vacation and got tons of questions and comments on them. Have since gotten another pair, different color/model and love those too 
Without a doubt the very best work shorts I have ever owned. I've tried Dickies ( they were too stiff and too tight, even though I bought a size larger than I normally wear ) and Columbia ( they were WAY too expensive .)These shorts are very heavy, but not at all stiff. They wear well and hold up. After being washed several times they will take on a slightly softer color and feel. I buy these literally by the dozen, and wear them everyday. I live in a subtropical climate and even wear these in the winter. They are the perfect work short. Plenty of room, large pockets. A hammer loop, which I never use, but is there if you need one. Not too long, and certainly not too short. These are THE shorts to own. 
This shoe is so comfortable. I have this style in three colors (black, navy and cream) and I have yet to wear them once when I did not receive a compliment. They look smart and feel great. Wide heel base makes for easy balance and stride. 
I have been purchasing the Vanity Fair My Satin Fantasy bras for years and YEARS!!!! BUT, I have become very very disappointed. I just bought 4 and ordered the free ones on the special offer "buy 2, get one free". Now I have 6 bras that are practicallly worn out after the first wearing! The little laces wore through nearly all the way, the stay poked out on the first wearing. I carefully hand wash them and hang to dry, no wringing. I think the manufacturer is trying to save money by eliminating the little plastic caps on the ends of the stays. I have a huge scratch where the stay ripped my skin. The style changed and the quality as well. I would like an explanation and would like money back! I am so sad that a great product is now less than mediocre 
I bought these shorts for my husband and they are great. You can't beat the price 
These are my favorite slippers, but are unfortunately not that easy to find, especially in the stores at any other time than Christmas. It's great to know that I can find what I want and need when I want and need it. I'll be back for another pair of these when I've worn out the ones I've got 
Regular Dearfoam Slippers were too short. The Dearfoam Boots are a little longer 
The slippers I purchased are very luxurious and attractive. They are nice and warm which is what I wanted, as I have poor circulation. They were moderately priced, and were delivered in a timely manner 
A very good product. Just watch for the slipper sizes. The sizing link (as well as the manufacturer's website) do not list the mapping between M/L/XL to actual US women shoe sizes. Had to exchange the product for this reason. The Medium (M) is actually for women shoe sizes 6 - 7.5. The Large (L) is for 8 - 9.5. This information is from the box. Hope this helps 
These slippers fit perfectly, more like a very comfortable shoe than a slipper. They are attractive, well made and a genuine bargain. Probably not for the very wide foot 
my wife likes and said these shoes were exactly what she wanted, thank you very much 
I bought a pair of these for my wife and ended up giving them to my daughter because I got the wrong size. I know my wife has a 9 size foot but the shoe size tool on the page doesn't tell you what "Small", "Medium", or "Large" translate to in numbers. I got a medium and that was a 6 to 7 size. At least it fit my daughter's foot 
When I received my purse, there was a small black smudge on the front of it. I sent a note to NVie Designs to see if it could be exchanged. They promptly replied with a return address to exchange the purse. Well, I was shocked to see my replacement purse in the mail before they had received my return! The purse is beautiful and I've received many compliments on it 
I bought this as a complement to a dress for a late summer wedding. Well, it goes with a lot more -- from jeans to dress up. I see a lot of Indian style purses, but I've never seen one like this. It is quite practical, too, by having a long strap to leave your hands free. Well done 
I bought this bag to have something with some pattern/color for when I am just wearing solid colors. It made my outfit really pop! I received a lot of compliments! My sisters couldn't believe how little I paid for it! It goes well with the whole "BoHo" trend 
I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers, but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented " Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their " . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT. 
I bought these shoes from Eastbay. They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life. After wearing them for less than a week, I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin. There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes. As you walk, it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable. I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product. 
I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price 
This is a cute restaurant style apron made of quality fabric. The apron was just as pictured and the company shipped it promptly. 
If you've been looking for a great pair of yoga pants for an active practice, look no further. These knicker-length pants(4 or 5 inches below your knee, depending on your height) are made of an 88% organic cotton, 12% Spandex blend. The material is just the right thickness for a sweaty practice (like Baptiste Power Yoga)-- fairly thin, but not skimpy feeling, wicks well enough, holds some moisture, but doesn't get or feel drenched during your practice. Verve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for climbers. That background shows in these pants -- the fit is just right, not tight (like a pair of long johns), but roomy (and stretchy) enough to allow easy movement between poses. Verve makes a longer Hanuman pant, that I have not tried. I really like the knickers because they let you see correct positioning of your feet and don't have surplus fabric that might get in your way -- really good for Tree pose, for example 
Guys Attention. These knickers really work. In a yoga world dominated by women and womens clothing I was really pleased to find clothing that gives guys that full range of motion without getting in the way. These fit well and don't bind at the waist. No uneccesary cloth at the calves and ankles. I love them 
The were what I was expecting, they would be better if the inside pockets were on both sides 
First, order a size larger than you usually get, they seem to run small. I love the sleeve length on these and the fit and feel of the fabric. The cut is very flattering. I am going to buy more of these. You can't beat the price 
I bought this in 3 different colors, black, red white. I was only able to wear the black because I made a mistake in the size of the other two. I hope to reorder as soon as I get my credit. Very nice tee that can be worn alone or under something. Thanks Amazon 
I am 5'8 and have trouble finding sleeves that stay long enough even after several washes, and these are great. XL fits a size 14-16 well 
For the price, these T-shirts are a bargain. They're a soft, lightweight cotton knit. I bought mine for working out at the gym, but they look good enough to wear as casual attire. They do run small. I bought a size larger than usual. 
For any and all Juicy fans alike, this bracelet is a MUST-HAVE in their collection. An absolutely stunning piece of couture heaven!! 
These panties are nice but do tend to run a little small. I ordered two sets of the girls and got grey undies??? Grey for a 2 year old girl...she wasnt liking them! Overall good quality though 
These training pants are good value for the money. I think they might be sized a little on the small size, but other than that they're just what we needed. I was having trouble finding this type of training pant locally in toddler sizes. For whatever reason, they are only stocked in my area up to a size 24 months. My son is big for his age and that just wasn't working. I do wish I had purchased the next size larger (4T) though, because I think it's just overall a little bit snug. If he grows much he won't be able to use them. Hopefully we won't need them for very long 
I get 2 girly pink - pink flowered pairs in the three pack and an ugly duckling Grey pair for the third. What the heck am I supposed to do with them? Do you think you can convince a 2 year old that those things could be worn by a princess? I think not my friend. That Grey pair is boring, ugly boy color! Then again I doubt that Superman, Spider-man or any of the X-Men would be caught dead wearing those atrocious briefs either. Loved the style, fabric and reinforced crotch but I do feel as if I got only 2 pairs for the price of 3! 
These cotton training pants are perfect for potty training. My son (2.5) became all excited about being a big boy in underpants now. Great quality, very soft. My suggestion: Skip Pampers etc training pants and move right on to cotton ones 
I really love these training pants. the best ones I have gotten so far. My 22 month old is pretty much potty trained with an occasional accident. These training pants are a little thicker then regular underwear, helps to keep the occasional accident contained. Very soft and fit nicely 
Nicely made, great fit and great look - my husband especially liked it 
Silk is very sexy, especially on women, but men will like wearing these, too. Just be careful to follow the washing instructions 
These bras offer zero support. They would be good for someone who is young and firm enough to not need it: 
I bought these shorts for my Dad and he's very pleased with them because of the comfort, fit and style. I highly recommend them 
Bought 2 not really knowing what to expect, but can now say these wear and wash GREAT. Soft cotton and a really nice fit. Going back for 3 more. Truly comparable to the 50.00 one at 1/3 the price.. I recommend these to all 
These t-shirts fit on the small side, for women (not Juniors) but are soft, comfortable, and well made. I have bought 4 
I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party, because I knew the girls would like them. I've been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot. My husband does too. They look good, turn him on, turn me on too. You can't ask for more than that in a panty, now can you 
I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine. They feel good on, look great and best of all, they're low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips. And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better, cuz these are so cute. Pretty darned enticing too, if you know what I mean 
These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too. 
They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
I bought this jacket for my wife and she loves it. It seems like it runs a little tight if you plan on wearing additional clothing like sweat-shirts. It looks good, very functional and at a great price at approximately $70. Now my wife can look good and quit taking my warm jackets 
Discovered ISOTONER slippers, a decade or more ago, at Macys. Tried imitations out there but NOT as comfortable so the other brands were exiled to the deep dark corner of my closet for closet monsters to use. Only buy ISOTONER now and don't share them with closet monsters. These slippers follow me around the house. I have even driven in them. I am wearing a pair right now. I make room for them in my bags when I travel -- never leave home without them. Arch support makes all the difference! The women's large is comparable to European size 39. When machine washed and machine dried, they come out looking like new. They do wear out eventually or get misplaced around the house so buy two pairs. Amusing aside: Until his feet grew too large, my teenage son used to steal my slippers (navy blue ISOTONER terry). Had to beg him to give them back. Now his feet are too large and the men's slippers I have bought him, he says, are not as comfortable, alas 
I've had a pair of Pillowstep Clog Slippers for years and they are still my favorite. I have tried other slippers, but have ended up have either returning them or throwing them away and going back to my tried and true Isotoners. I'm glad they still make them; I'm going to get a pair in a different color. The design looks even better: the sole appears to be more plush, and the satin edging is a nice touch. The slippers are easy to slip on, but not easy to slip in! (good traction), and they wash up great in the washing machine everytime. BUT the most important thing is that these slippers help reduce the pain in my feet. There are the only slippers I've had with arch support and they conform and stay on even though they are "clogs". I have problems with my feet. I've been wearing Birkenstocks lately, and even with these, my feet hurt after a few hours, and I can't wait to put on my "Pillowsteps" at the end of the day. Enjoy 
The pillowstep terry clog slipper is the most comfortable slipper I have ever owned. They are pillow soft when you step and they fit nice to your foot and do not slip around when you walk 
I like that these slippers have a rubber sole so if I have to step outside, it's OK. I wear them around the house. They're very comfortable and not flimsy 
The slippers are attractive with the little satin edge and the sole is comfortable 
These are very nice and comfortable. The even have extra arch support. These are just as nice as the Deerskin but with the added support. 
The key holder/credit card pouch/coin holder was just as described. The size is perfect for my needs. It fits well in my pocket. Nice quality. Good price. It came in sooner than expected 
I do like these boots but I have had better fleece boots for standing all day in. I work as a bank teller and after standing all day the boots don't offer much support. They still feel comfortable but a like the padding has been mashed down. Not as comfy as when I first bought them. As far as warmth they are great. Enough sheerling to stay warm but not get too hot when it's warmer outside. 
These boots are warm, comfy and a great deal. The only thing missing is the "ugg" label, so if you're into quality and not brand these are the boots for you 
customer service was great. everytime i asked a question i got a reply straight away, and i got my product very quickly. i reccomend this company 
These boots are so great. Really warm and comfortable and you can even wear them with bare feet! They were really tight at first, but the material stretches perfectly to your feet, just give them a few days. The top isn't too tight either like a lot of these kinds of boots. Love them! 
WITH BOTH NEUROPATHY AND KNEE REPLACEMENTS I HAVE HAD HARD TIME FINDING SHOES COMFORTABLE ,LIGHT ,STABLE,ADAPT TO FEET..NOT FEET ADAPT TO SHOE.....MOLD TO BETTER FIT THAN ORTHOTICS....AFTER A FEW WEARINGS....CLEAN UP WELL WITH CLOTH AND WATER....WARM IN WINTER BUT NOT HOT IS SUMMER...CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THEM.. 
These are one of the most comfortable golf pants I have ever worn. They look very nice, and feel awesome. The waist band on the side gives one the perfect fitting for an ever changing waistline 
The shirt is a great color!! It was a gift and she loved it. Very fast shipping from where we bought it as well 
These are great shoes, like any 3 3/4 inch heel, it takes a few wears to break them in. Everyone loves them, and the match everything. I agree with product suggestions, purchase 1/2 size bigger and they will fit perfect 
I love these shoes...they're comfortable and stylish...everytime I wear them I get compliments on them. The heel is sort of high but they are surprisingly comfortable. They make my feet look smaller too 
Love these shoes. they are really made well and good quality. the shipping also was great 
These pumps are very cute, but don't plan to wear them more than 3 hours. After 3 hours I almost couldn't walk. They a little bit to high and to narrow....But way to cute...they perfect for a dinner date, but not for a dancing date.: 
I ordered these a half size bigger and they fit just fine! I love how they make my feet look small (I'm a size 9). Definitely purchase these 
These were the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet. (I say "were" because I threw them in the trash after 4 hours of wear). They are cute, though 
Much more confortable than I thought, and i'm used to wearing pumps every day. They may run a little snug, so if you're going to wear w/out hose, you might go up a half size. I'm very pleased with this purchase 
I bought this for my Grandson and he loves it. It saves his mom from picking up towels all over the house after his shower 
They were an excellent price and a great quality. It was everything I wanted in a robe. 
This is a very heavy duty terry cloth robe. I purchased it for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. I went to several department stores before Christmas and couldn't find the right texture. This is a great value and a durable robe. Enjoy! 
I am quite happy with the Easy Spirit Sandals I ordered. The fit is good and they are very comfortable to wear 
I have to say that I liked the crotchless French Knichers (also by Love Fifi) better and that I'll probably buy a ton of them, but I'll get a pair or two of these as well, because there are sometimes in the bedroom when you just want to play the Devil and everybody knows Satan always wears red. This is the last review tonight. We've had mabye a bit to much to drink, a bit of harmless fun for under a hundred dollars each, and we all got to record a bit here about what we thought about these very sexy undies. It has been fun and I hope we can do it again sometime 
I like these made in the USA crotchless panties. We got them in red, but they come in black and white as well. The red is just so darned sexy it's scary. Anyway, I think you'll like them, especially if you like giving your man a thrill sometimes. It's too bad we can't continue this, because we're having so much fun, but it's getting late, I'm getting tipsy and I have a lot to do tomorrow, yeah right, I'll be sleeping in that's for sure. I hope you liked our little ramblings here, sincerely, Ophella 
Boy oh boy, Jack just about went gaga when he saw me in these. I can tell that I'll have to have a pair or two to wear on those special summer nights. I think these would go good with Italian food. A nice pasta, a good Chianti, an after dinner drink, turn the lights down low, change into something more comfortable, just these panties and nothing else. Ah yes, that would be fun. Anyway, like the other girls I want to say I've really enjoyed this evening. You could do it too. Just get a few friends together, spend less than a hundred dollars each, drink some wine, have fun, talk girl talk and show off. Sincerely, Sara 
Red, what a daring color. Ruffles, they give off a look of innocence, belied by the red. The high back is gorgeous and once again Stephanie, with her perfect body, is the star of the show. We all look good in these, don't get me wrong, but Stephanie just simple looks beautiful in these, delectiable, good enough to -- Well, let me leave it there. And that's were we're leaving it tonight, I guess I get the last word. It's been fun, this party. I admit, I was a little leary have Jack here (he is a man, after all), but it worked out okay. We'll have to do it again sometime. Till then, bye bye from Dani Lane 
I was skeptical of crotchless panties but these are the most comfortable panties I've owned to date. I'm going to buy a couple more pairs soon 
i had this shoe in another color and loved it so much i wanted all the colors! they are very comfy and go with everything 
love the shoes i want another pair in different color...arrived on time and all is well 
I'm very pleased with the slippers and my experience with Amazon and Land's End was excellent 
I was very pleased with this item, it was exactly as it appeared on website, and even though I picked a light color, they have held up well to dirt. My only disappointment was the lack of padding inside the shoe. I expected a little more, but they are still comfy, none the less 
Once you wear a pair of the Hanky Panky panties, you will never want to wear another brand ever again! I was skeptical at first because they are one size fits all, but they really are so comfortable...I can't even tell I am wearing them! They are VERY sexy, which comfort and sexy usually don't belong in the same sentence when it comes to underwear!!! You will not be disappointed! I wear a lot of low rise jeans and they are well hidden underneath! They come in so many beautiful colors and cuts if you don't want the low rise fit 
This is a great starter thong I have not had good luck with the thongs I've tried in the past. I heard that if you try them out for a week, you'll love 'em and never go back to normal underwear again. Well, I couldn't even make it 2 days straight with my "starter thong". I don't know what brand it was, but it sure wasn't comfortable. This Hanky Panky 4811 thong is very nice. I read a bunch of reviews and just had to try it. I put it on one evening after work, and I even wore it to bed! It is comfortable, and stays put pretty well. It doesn't hurt when I bend over, like the other thongs I tried. AND... it fits me well. I am a size 16/18 and I have no problems with the size. It stretches nicely, and does not dig in on my hips, or anywhere else. It fits perfectly! I will definirely be buying more of these, they're great 
The shoe didn't have any insole support, it was very flat no cushion feeling in the insole! Leather was soft, almost too giving. Shoe size for B ran very tight...If you aren't seeking a good support to your shoe and aren't walking alot this may be an okay choice for you. 
Very stylish comfortable shoe. I bought 3 pair and love them all 
Received these shoes extremely fast. The shoes fit perfectly and were in excellent condition. I have four pair of these shoes in different colors because of their comfort and price. I have had excellent service from Bealls 
This is THE most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn, and they are nice enough to dress up or down. I was initially reluctant to buy them because they are so inexpensive, but I'm glad I let the reviews persuade me. They appear to be exceedingly well made, and they are so comfortable that it's almost like being able to go to the office in your favorite slippers. 
I bought two pairs of these back in 2000 - navy and black. I'm still wearing those original shoes. They are EXTREMELY comfortable, and I think that their softness has helped extend the lives of the shoes. I can wear them to work with a pair of dress pants and stockings or trouser socks, and I can also wear them au naturale with a pair of jeans. For as long and as often as I've worn mine, the value is unbeatable. The price is more than fair 
I have them in red and it's a nice dark red. The size is true, but the leather is really soft so if you are looking for a stiffer shoe this one is not for you. 
The product came the first day of the expected delivery window and was in great condition 
great shirt to wear with a tie minus the jacket. for a thin guy like me, they are ample enough to be durable, but not too baggy. for the price, you can't beat it 
I have been wearing these shirts for years. Good price, good quality, great customer service from Land's End. The collars fray too quickly with repeated washings which is this product's biggest problem and the buttons sometimes need additional fastening. Overall a very good buy 
At first I was daunted by the size of the wallet, but WOW!! It really does organize my stuff!! I like that I am able to remove it from my purse to carry into a store and 'lighten my load', if you will. Real leather- nice construction. I'm happy with this item 
i wana order the leo desdin size 8 or 8.50 but it is not avalable since long time when it is gonna be avalable agin : 
I am so happy with my stilletos. These are the first I have bought, and I would definitely stay with these. They were pretty comfy the first time I put them on, and comfortable enough to wear them around the house cleaning to break them in. I love them, and can't wait to get the black and red pair 
Everything went according to plan. The shoes were exactly as advertised. They matched my daughter's winter formal's dress perfectly. Thank you 
i bought a pair of these shoes in red because they just looked so hot, i live in Australia so it took a while for them to arrive, i was a bit nervous with the sizing, as being Australian our sizing is different to America's i bought a size 9 because i'm about at 8 1/2 in Aus sizes. But they fit perfectly and are suprisingly comfortable, i could wear them all day and my feet won't be sore, its fantastic and they are so hot! i want to get other colours now. 
This bra is exactly like the ones I usually get at the department store in the mall. The quality is great. The best part about it, I didn't have to fight for a parking space or through the crowds to get it. 
My sister is crazy about flamingos. She lives in Idaho but still displays flamingos all over her property and home--tastefully. What better gift for a flamingo lover 
My daughter is a flamigo fanatic and loved the bag. She had received a shirt from this same store (bought by her grandmother) a couple years ago. They match. The bag arrived quickly even during the holiday season and even met our short deadline to take it for Christmas at Grandma's. The bag's square bottom sits nicely on the floor and the heavy cotton material helps it stand up a bit and will last forever. The flamingo images seem pretty robust also. Thanks. 
I think New Balance is a great shoe and fits well. These are the best New Balance I have purchased. The sole is wonderful and provides great stability. My only complaint is that not enough attention is paid to a really good arch support. Once I purchased additional arch insoles the shoes were great 
My armband is just the right size for the opening,I think the other user tried to put the clip end in instead of the other side like you are supposed to. This is a well worth the price. I have not seen this style out there. I like all the color options. The armband works great for working out 
This case was fast to ship from My Gear Store, and a great buy for the money 
This is my second nano skin(The first one i bought from somebody else was awful) So i got a black and white one from this seller, and it looks SO GOOD! Try it! you won't be disappointed! altho i have to say i wish there are more color combinations. 
My boy friend really likes it, says it makes him feel classy 
I`m very happy with this wallet is top notch quality with lots of card space and pockets 
Sweatshirts were perfect I could not find them locally in the size and color that I needed 
I was costuming a play and needed gold sweatshirts...couldn't find any in retail stores. Found these on Amazon and they turned out to be exactly what we needed. They held up great during a four week run of the show 
These jeans have all of the features that I was supposed to look for to best suit my body type; dark wash, heavier weight denim and boot cut legs that do not narrow at the knee. I think they look great and fit as well as other brands I have purchased at much higher prices. Happy days 
These are my 15 year old son's favorite jeans. The only problem is that they only lasted 6 months. The material has not held up well, and has developed holes by the back pocket(typical but a little early) and another by the fly(just kind of fell apart). I would prefer he would try something else, but he truly loves these pants and is willing to pay for them himself, which I guess says something 
I don't even know I'm wearing underwear and they work well with low rise jeans because they sit very low! It is TRUE that one size fits all because I am not model thin and they fit great. They stay put on my hips and I never feel like I have a "wedgy" even though they are thong! I highly recommend them 
SELLERS HAVE THEM ON EBAY--GO CHECK IT OUT IF YOU CAN'T FIND THEM ONLINE 
This is a wonderful product! I hate thongs, but thought I'd try this one after seeing the WallStreet Journal article. They were right! It's fabulous and I cannot wait to buy more. It's super comfy and doesn't move where you don't want it to. It works great with low rise jeans and doesn't obnoxiously "hang out" when you bend over. :) Thanks so much!! If you don't want to get hooked, don't buy one. : 
Just right, good length, inexpensive -- what more could you want in a slip 
This is a very nice slip, but only if you want an A-line shape that measures 56 inches at the bottom. This cannot be worn with a straight skirt or dress. The picture is somewhat deceiving 
These slips were a gift for my mom, I sent some from a Dept. Store but they were not in the length that she wanted, which is 25" long. The Dept. Stores now only have half slips in much longer lengths, 28"-32". Such a shame for a petite woman, it would end up going down to her ankles! I am so happy for my mom that Amazon had these beautiful half slips available, from Vanity Fair which she simply loves and the perfect length, for petite women. Not all of us women are giants, from, "Giant Land", you know?!! We have nicely proportioned figures and we don't need the, NEW Half Slips with Fanny Pad's, etc., and all of those extra deceitful under garment freakture's to hide behind in! Thank goodness, and we are ladies, who wish to dress like ladies! P.S. The beautiful satiny, soft material, was so beautiful too, perfect in every way!  Thank you very much, Amazon Vanity Fair, I am a very happy custumer 
My daughter-in-law saw this wallet on line and asked for it as a Christmas gift. It was exactly what she wanted, just as advertised, excellent quality, and even though I ordered it late, it was received in time for Christmas. She was delighted 
The item was never received and an email to the seller resulted in no response. How do I get my money back? Additionally, this was a X-mas present with an expected delivery date of 12/22/06. Needless to say it didn't get here in time for X-mas 
It has a great fit. There's plenty of room, and it has a nice full bottom. The snaps at the bottom are extremely well made, and they lie nice and flat. The construction is excellent. I always buy a body suit (leotard) at least one size bigger than my normal shirt size. You want plenty of room in the crotch area so you don't get a lot of pull from the bottom. Do treat your leotard somewhat gently so that you don't get a snag in it from a ring or rough handling. I wash it in a fabric bag and let it air dry. If you have a little tummy, the leotard will flatten you out and give you a nice smooth shape 
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be. It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier. I am going to buy another in a different color 
This is a great skin for a Treo 700. I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that. As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc). But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection. I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch. I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type. The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press. 
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick 
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow 
I highly recommend this incredibly comfortable bra. Its the first one I don't want to fling off as soon as I get in the house. As a 38D with a physically active job, I need something with great support. This bra offers that without the underwire - halleluia! The material is great too and the one that I bought two months ago has worn really well. I will definately be buying more 
Got this for my 19YR old niece - great fit and comfortable! (Alone or under a hoodie) Pale pink color is lovely with a tan! 
Utterly impressive array of colors, it sure brightens up everyone's face when they a pair of such jolly socks. Downside? After one or two washings the sock begin to shrink and they become less vibrant; despite that I will try to expand my collection as these are very happy and good looking socks. Basically, I give five stars for design and look; two stars for durability. Three and a half altogether. 
I have had a black one of these for years, and the lace is just finally starting to go. It's a great neckline for a more professional look (a little higher than the standard cami) - but the lace keeps it feminine with a little sexy. The lace isn't sheer - and the lace straps are wide, easily concealing a bra straps for more open necks tops. Also - the nylon exterior clings to NOTHING, and the inside cotton is super soft, and the lace is very soft as well. Can't wait to get my replacement black and a new one in white 
Not only is this camisole very comfortable but it looks good too. It looks great peeking out from beneath a blazer or wrap style top. It is very soft and has a nice drape. I was worried that the lace would itch but it too is very soft and comfortable. 
Very pretty light weight summer dress. The fit is right on. I am well endowed in the front and am always worried how things will fit. This dress is very flattering 
Just what I was looking for. Great price and fast shipment 
The shirt arrived about two or three days after I placed the order. I was satisfied-only recommendation would be to wrap it in plastic before putting it in mailing envelope to prevent tearing-luckily this didn't happen to me. Otherwise-no complaints-would buy from them again! 
bought this for my granola hippy dude teen nephew..he loves it..the stick figure is cute, it was pkgd. well and came super fast...bought from this company twice actually they are great 
I love Birkenstock products and was thrilled to get these clogs for under $50 with free shipping! They arrived on time and are super-comfortable. 
I had never ordered shoes online before but when you order the Burk footbed you know you are getting the right size and these fit perfect. The quality was great and I would not hesitate to order from this seller again. 
This is an excellent product, and also the price the only thing is that the size is a little bit wrong i used shoes 42 european size and these shoes are lightly bigger than the size 
I wanted mocha betula birkenstocks...I didn't know whether to get suede or nubuk because I didn't know the difference between the two...I ended up getting the nubuck because the picture looked better...the material is better than suede, its waterproof and they will last longer....I had suede before and they ended up changing colors because of the wear and tear..if you have the same problem these are what you should get...not the suede ones.. 
These are great slacks for the price. Comfortable and not apt to wrinkling for a bit as it says. The sidebanding helps with slacks being typically smaller/tighter/less forgiving than jeans. The olive and black colors look somewhat more professioanl than the rest. The only caveat is that they aren't cuffed, so it doesn't look dressy- but it's dressy enough to go to work and not worry it if they get ruined. At 25 bucks, it rivals old navy pricing, but without the infantile look or no stock issues they have. Oh, and these suckers shipped in 2 days from Joseph Bank. Fastest I've ever gotten an order from amazon or their resellers. Very nice. It's durable/nice looking and just works 
These shirts are made of heavier material then your average tee-shirt. They fit well with enough room in them for performing physical labor. The loop over the pocket to hold your pencil is a nice touch. But even if you drop your pencil, these shirts are made long enough for you to bend over and pick it up with confidence 
Extremely comfortable soft - I bought three different brands online this was by far the best. Ended up buying two more 
As soon as my order cleared the manager called me to verify the color and sizes I wanted. He was professional and friendly and told me when to expect the hoodie and the pants. I recommend getting the set. This is amazingly comfortable and flattering- pants look great on the butt! I recommend getting different sizes if you are smaller on top - it looks cuter. Very cute set! I will be getting more in different colors 
I bought two (and got three) of these for my parents who are going to Italy in the spring. Its compact and I think it will be very useful for the long plane rides and travel time on the bus 
As someone who travels on a weekly basis I have found this travel kit an absolute life saver. When you consider vanishing airline pillows and less than hygenic airline blankets, this is a MUST HAVE item. The kit comes in a range of great colors, it includes a full length blanket and matching eye mask. 
I love these things-- my last pair hung in there for 3 summers, and if you wear them long enough, they totally mold to your feet! You usually pay 25 bucks, but I bought two pairs for half price from FootLocker (via Amazon) in anticipation of the nice weather. Unfortunately, it's currently about 15 degrees in Southern Connecticut.. 
These are simply the best sport sandals ever created. I wear none other 
This is the second pair of these sandals that I have bought and am again pleased with my purchase. The first pair lasted 4.5 years, and I hope this pair does the same! The countours on the feet are comfortable, and strap is just supportive and smooth enough 
These are so comfortable. I love them and would recommend them to anyone. 
great sandalsa, and washable too! Better than expected, have ordered 6 more pair in 3 other colors 
These were better than I could have hoped! I wore them for the first time, for 8 hours, on the first day of my vacation in Hawaii without breaking them in. In the water and tromping two miles through the jungle left me with no blisters or sore places on my feet! Very confortable 
I just started doing water aerobics and needed a shoe for traction while in the pool. Unfortunately, I need to wear sandals for medical reasons and apparently no one (including Columbia) makes a water aerobics sandal. I tried these because they sounded like they could handle exposure to water and were at a really good price. They handle the water just fine, drying completely in about 8 hours and show no sign of falling apart. The traction isn't as strong as I would like, but it's better than bare feet or having damaged toes from shoes. Also, the sandals create more drag in the water than regular water aerobics shoes, making my feet cramp more than they probably would have. I gave the product five stars because the sandals are performing the way they were advertised; I'm just using them for something they weren't designed for 
Great shoes, rugged, amphibious as promised, and the quality I expect from Columbia. (I bought these because, as much as I love my Crocs, I needed a less goofy look but all the water-friendly features.) My only wish is for half sizes, as the sole runs a little long past my toes, increasing potential for tripping. This is a great shoe for light hiking but if you're climbing over a lot of rocks, get something that covers your toes. 
I've been wearing these sandals for almost 2 months and they're terrific. I've never been able to find a pair in this style that I've been able to wear comfortably and not get blisters or sore spots. These are very comfortable. I can walk in them for hours and they don't "rub me the wrong way". Quality and comfort and they look good - what more can you ask 
These are very comfortable beach shoes and I was very pleased with the price. I would change the color names because they are too vague and I could only guess which one would match my swimsuit 
Very comfortable, and great walking sandal. This shoe runs true to size. Very pleased 
Overall very comfortable but were a little stiff at first, got some blisters but now they feel as good as sneakers with very good support. 
I like how well it works to dress up some of my work outfits as well as my everyday wear. It is great for everything 
Great-fitting, durable, figure-improving hose for taller women is hard to find. Your product is beyond compare--no one else comes close to you in creating comfortable, beautiful, supportive, figure-enhancing panty hose that feel SECURE! Please don't change a thing!!!! 
I discovered Shue's some time ago and was so thrilled to find them on Amazon.com. This is a great product for anyone with neuropathy or diabetes. They are made so that they are not restricting and don't have elastic or anything to feel tight or hurt your feet. Great product! 
plus a great fit! I really like these fuzzy slippers. I hate wearing shoes around the house, and these are a great compromise. They're very warm and the choice of colors means there's one to fit every mood. I just ordered another pair 
THESE LITTLE BOOTIES ARE SO CUTE AND COMFY. HAVE SOLES SO I CAN WALK AROUND IN THE YARD. I HAVE A PAIR OF MUK LUKS FROM THE SAME COMPANY, GREAT ON COLD FLORIDA DAYS, I GUESS NO LONGER AVAILABLE, TOO BAD. I DON'T CARE FOR SANDALS, TOO EASY TO TRIP AND FALL OVER A CAT, STEPS, WHATEVER. THESE STAY ON MY FEET, ABLE TO WALK, OLD LADY. GOT RED PEPPER, GREAT COLOR, GOOD BUY. I FELL DOWN MY DECK STEPS WITH A PAIR OF HOUSE SHOES I HAD, VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I WEAR NOW. GREAT BUY! 
These slippers are wonderful - like being barefoot but warm and cosy. Only one complaint - when new they have a tendency to shed, but that's obviously not enough to keep me from re-ordering - I'm "into" my second pair and have 2 saved for next winter 
These slippers are great--nice and warm without being too bulky. They're super-soft and have a nice anti-slip tread on the bottom. The only thing I would like is adding a bit more cushion to the bottom of the slipper--otherwise, a fantastic deal in the single-digit dollar amounts.. 
These have become my most favorite slippers. They are so soft, cuddly warm. Thanks ever so much for carrying them. 
My search for the perfect gym bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying, yoga mat, organizing products, garlic press (Zyliss) etc. Fortunately, my search for the perfect gym bag is officially over. The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. Next, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. Before I bought this bag, I called my gym and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers. The magic number was 12". At 8", the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare. For raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. For yogis and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat, if it's not too thick. An outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones. The only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title9 doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. In other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit pricey but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Ogio, and thank you very, very much 
This bag is simply amazing! I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean-up afterwards. The Ogio Locker Bag does it all: it's got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear. It fits perfectly in just about any gym's locker (I go to Bally's) and with its front-opening door, you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker! I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also with a comb, brush, and mirror. To top it off, it's light-weight, sturdy, and even comes with a built-in vent so that your wet/sweaty clothes don't get too ripe! LOL! : ) I couldn't be happier with my purchase! GET THIS BAG!! You won't be disappointed 
Ideal for anyone travelling to Britain who intends to plug something in during their stay 
I bought them in red and I can wear them with many different outfits. Very cute, fit well and surprisingly comfortable 
I got these in black... not sure what i will wear them with. Very cute, and pretty comfortable. Highly recommend 
I LOVE them and wear them w/basically anything! great prices, perfectly made and comfortable! im 5'9 with out shoes and about 6'1 with the shoes on...well....just a little under that 
These shoes are very comfortable and really cute! Run a little small so be careful when ordering. 
The shoes run a little small so order a half size up, but I love the shoes overall. They fit great and are very stylish. 
These came from Bealls and I must say my husband LOVES them! It's hard to find short shorts and they're excellent quality 
This shirt has a soft feel like it has been washed many times, right out of the package. Great quality and the color is perfect. I love it 
Love how easy it was to order, unfortunately I ordered the wrong size twice but had no problem returning purchases for credit. 
These shoes looked great, but had to return them because they were to small. When shopping for puma, increase the shoe size 1 full. 
I have sensitive hands and most gloves are too tight or too loose and never warm enough. These gloves are such a comfortable fit and actually keep the cold out. I love them 
This purchase was well worth the money- gloves are soft yet warm, great fuschia color pink and durable. 
These pants are soft, fit to a T, and did not shrink when washed. Look good too 
The quality of this item is fabulous the shipping was FAST, but they do run a bit small. All in all, it's a good pair of yoga pants and a great price 
Adidas makes very nice summer sandals. This is the cheapest that I've seen. I buy them for my kids every summer...They last all summer and beyond, unlike other sandals. My kids think they are cool too 
Nice pair of slippers with great looks... I love the way they massage the feet when walking... if I had to choose one downfall, I would say they get dirty pretty quickly, and since the massaging spikes are hard to get into, it's harder to clean them... otherwise a decent pair of slippers... I'd definitely buy another pair in the futur 
I bought these slides for house slippers based on the other reviews I read. I will give one caution, you may not like them in the first few weeks. The first few times I wore them, my feet were really sore after about an hour or two. I recommend wearing them with socks for a week or so until all the nobbies soften and become more flexible. After this break-period, you'll be able to wear them any way you like and you'll love how they feel after a long day of wearing shoes 
For a trip to the beach, just down the street, or for a warm outing, these sandals serve their purpose. First and foremost, the soles massage the feet every step. The sensation is quite soothing especially when first breaking them in. Even after having these sandals for longer than a year they still do cushion the feet very well. The addidas brand and outer design are a blast to wear and show off. It's funny, but true that I actually receive attention pertaining to a pair of sandals. This pair has the best of both worlds 
Great versatile sandals for the price. Will never go out of style, and you can wear them almost anywhere, with almost anything 
When I first got the sandals it was a pain to have on. They have these brissels on the sole of the foot so it was uncomfortable for a couple of days but I guess they softened up and now I wear them like everyday with socks and with out. The are very comfortable and not much else, because they are just sandels. Very good quality too, very durable... A MUST BUY... (If you need sandals 
These were replacing the same thing so I knew what I was getting. Pool side they are the greatest sandals or maybe even just lounging around. Adidas makes pretty good stuff. 
My wife loves this kind of earmuff (over the top of the head). She doesn't like the ones that wrap around the back of your head/neck - she finds those squeeze her head and aren't comfortable after long periods of time (and fall off). This model is her favorite and she wears them every (winter) day. This is her second pair in about 6-7 years - they seem to have a long life. Very durable, and fold up nicely to put in your pocket. Yet easy to open and put on your head. She has been known to wear them for hours at a time and finds them very comfortable. They stay on your head even when running/jogging, and are also light weight, wind proof, and warm 
I still have not received this item and am wondering what in the world is going on 
I almost didn't order these ear muffs based on some other reviews, but I'm really glad I did. If you're looking for a simple ear muff, these are it and they are a great deal at only 5.69. One of the other reviewers commented that they were poor quality and too thin. They are thin because they are made with Thinsulate! If you want something bulky, I guess you should order a product not made with Thinsulate. 
I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue. Here's why: 1. The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality. Hardly worth the $14.99 GemAvenue (e4hats) charged me for it. $0.99 would have been a fair deal. 2. The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite "second hand" feel to it. It reminded me of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store!!! No Joke. In fact there were no tags on it at all to inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc. it did not even have the name of the manufacturer!!!! 3. The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure. Adjusting the width was nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it! 4. The "wool"(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it. Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy. I doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue. Besides, there was no tag to indicate that it wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester. 5. I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears warm at all. IN CONCLUSION, this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!! What more can I say? I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue (e4hats) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK!!! I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue (e4hats) EVER again!! 
I had been shopping in stores, and could not find "traditional" ear muffs. It only took me 5 minutes through Amazon.com to find exactly what I wanted. These ear muffs are comfortable, sized right, and a great price 
Love the Athens Crocs...flip-flops but better. Bought them just before a vacation and have been wearing them ever since. The bottom is very cushy but supportive. Great if on your feet or having to walk for awhile. I used to go out and after a while my feet would ache, but with these, I can walk and stand for a long time and my feet don't get achy. One suggestion...these run large. I originally ordered a 9 and they were way too big. I had to exchange them for one size smaller, then the fit was perfect. Also, the first couple of time I wore them I could feel the strap between my toes, but by the 2nd day, I couldnt feel it any longer, so just stick with it 
Luv them, but order 1 size smaller - they run BIG - I wear a true W-6 but they were too big. Size W-5 fit great. You might have to go to kids crocs. They should tell you that in item description so you can order correctly. Besides that, I would give them a 5. I have no idea why they are sized so wrong. If you order your true size you will have to return them for one full size smaller for a proper fit 
I've been wanting these since last summer...the price was the seller! Comfortable and light-weight...Crocs are great 
I tried these crocs since I was looking for a flip flop that I could use for coaching swimming. Most flip flops make my back hurt after a while since I am standing on concrete for 3 hours. I like how these have a raised heel, and the pressure all goes to my heel which makes it really comfortable. I wear a 7.5 and I bought the 7 and it fits great! I really like the two-toned color and got the fushia/lime crocs 
I have a few pair of clog crocs and bought these for a HI vacation. They were very comfortable and provided great support. I'm looking forward to wearing them after work and on weekends this coming Summer 
These sandals are very attractive and very light. Too attractive and too light; if you leave them close to the water's edge as my wife did the first time she wore them. The ocean took a great liking to her sandals, I managed to recover one but the other is now sailing around the Caribbean Sea 
My fourteen year old daughter loves Crocs! These were a Christmas gift and she was thrilled. She will be all set for our Summer trips to the lake. I loved the price--cheaper than any place else 
excelentes en diseño y tamaño, comprelos si piensa en ropa util y durader 
I WILL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN REAL SOON... THANK 
no proper shape to the cap and the booties doesn't stay fit to the legs of baby not worth paying fo 
I hate to see parents with their babies outside on windy, cool days with nothing on their feet and/or head. Size is just right and my boy will be able to wear for the next couple of months. 
It is hard to imagine a better price on a twill cap than the one I got on this one. It is as sturdy, attractive, wearable, versatile as any cap I have ever owned. I don't know if I got the "sale price" on this item, but I do remember it was a fantastic price. Had no idea the quality would be so good. If you are looking for an "extra cap" with no logo on it, this is about as good as you can do. The delivery was timely, the tranaction worked seamlessly between amazon and the supplier 
I bought these slides based on the good review but have no idea that they would be so comfortable. They are very well made and perfect fit that wrapped around my feet. The color is very neutral for the summer. I think I'm going to enjoy lots of walking with them during the summer months 
Super comfortable sandals !! Great price !! Will buy more in several colors ! 
you can't go wrong for the price , at 50% off this is a steal . the dept stores that carry Clarks ,never sell for this cheap . I bought 5 , yes 5 pairs of Clarks last week , 4 pairs are this style , different colors .. i just couldnt resist .. and i received the shoes today ... tried them on and they are COMFORTABLE :) , i cant wear them yet out , but i am sure i will get real good use this summer ..... go for it .... don't pass up a good deal 
Love Clarks and loved the price so I ordered these for my daughter as a future gift. Size 12's aren't found many places especially at a bargain price. They look great and over good support. The difference in these compared to others is the stitching on the top piece. It's stitched on top rather than invisible and it seems to make it a little less wide. Hope it works well for her. 
This is a comfortable slide in a neutral color, but the leather is a bit stiff, not as pliable as some of the other Clarks sandals I have. Maybe it will soften in time. But they are still good everyday sandals and they were a good buy, hence the 4 stars 
I love Clarks. They are the best fitting shoes I have ever worn. They never hurt my feet and I have to be careful with me feet because I am a diabetic. You can't go wrong with Clarks. I try to buy my Clarks on Amazon because I can get such good prices 
The shoes are great, very comfortable and ordering throught Amazon was quick and easy. They were delivered within a few days and I didn't order express shipping. I will buy through Amazon again. I highly reccomend shopping with Amazon 
Clarks shoes never let me down. They are well made and look good on my feet. I own several pair and look forward to owning more. Love my new sandals 
Good job getting the shoes here ahead of schedule. They're a little different than expected -- guess the photos didn't show the detail as well as I thought. Once I got used to them, I'm pleased with the fit and comfort. For the price, thinking of buying another pair, maybe not just the same but similar 
I love my Silk Tank Tops. I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice. Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks. The quality is very good for the price. The initial fit was just a tad snug, but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now. I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk. But for casual wear, or sleeping at night I love them. 
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone 
I bought this top for my 18 year old son---thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. It is. He likes wearing it, but he says he would never wear it alone. It is a wee bit too 'feminine' to wear on top. Would I buy another one? I don't know. I think for him, the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile. 
Great quality item, excellent speedy delivery, very happy to have dealt with this vendor 
I was very pleased with the Urlacher jersey for my grandson. He has hardly taken it off since Christmas 
...you will love this cap. So comfortable and adorable. I hate hats and I wear it all the time! GO YANKEES 
I have been wearing Harbor Bay Stretch waist pants for quite some time. Last year I bought some Geo Foreman stretch pants--which fit fine but the material is not good--it beads up and my wife has a term for that, which I can't remember, and I wear them once and they wrinkle so bad it looks like I slept in them. The store did not carry your Harbor Bay any more and when I found I could order on line--that was terrific. I love your product-I will order more in another couple weeks --I would like these in brown beside Navy and grey 
These slacks compare very favorably with pants in expensive "Big Men" type clothing stores, yet are quite affordable. I Have been very pleased with the look and durability of these trousers 
I am very please with these pants. They look good and are comfortable to wear 
These shoes are very comfortable even wearing them for the first time. The make is slightly bigger than the actual size. I ordered a medium width which fits well though I thought I usually wear narrow width. I was going to order another pair in a different color but they were already sold out. It is a bargain [...]. They go well with pants and would be OK with causal dresses. 
I like these shoes because they are durable, however the toes are very pointed and don't have much room. The material behind the ankle is low, so it's difficult to use inserts without making them feel like flip-flops 
i think these shoes are the best shoes i ever had (and trust me i have alot of shoes) they are comfortable and very fashionable people always ask me where i got them they cost alot but i think it is worth it !!!! 
Adidas has three types of shoes for their "Ride" shock absorption running shoes; the Gigaride, Megaride, and this - the Microride. Microride outsole consists of smaller sized absorption grooves (aka Nike Shox lookalike). Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption. Microride is more concerned with weight, it seems like. There are also two models of Microride, one with full fabric top, another with synthetic leather construction. This one is the full fabric, which is supposed to be soft, and also lighter. (The synthetic leather is supposed to be more durable.) Anyway, with the combination of Microride and full mesh top, this shoe is low and very light. I can't find a number anywhere, but once started running, the shoes feel like featherweight. The impact is a little bit harder, due to less shock absorption, so it's probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails. Overall, though, very comfortable. It's my first time with running shoes this light and I like it. With these, I achieved my fastest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected. A couple of things I did notice: the size is on the narrow/small side (compared to my Nikes), and the back heel support is a bit hard/tall for my liking. The white version gets dirty quickly. Running was good, but walking on wet road experienced slight slippage. Also, the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired 
I found this shoe quite stable and surprisingly shock-absorbing. I usually buy my adidas size 10, but this was a tad larger than other adidas size 10. So beware and buy it 1/2 a size smaller than you usually buy your adidas. A very good running shoe overall 
These boots are not only cute, but they work great (and I would know - I live in Seattle). My only complaint is that they aren't comfortable for walking long distances, and the lining came up after wearing them a few times. But, overall, I'm very happy with my rain boots - I get compliments on them every time I wear them 
Very nice shoe. Got them at an excellent sales price of $19.95 plus shipping. I am very pleased 
This is the perfect little Summer shoe!! Great Ked's quality with a fashionable design! 
I can remember wearing Ked's when I was in high school and it was cool even then. The distressed sneaker is comfortable,and easy to wear right out of the box. Just slip them on and GO 
The product was fine and I got it very quickly. But my husband didn't like the length that the sleeves came to 
This is an amazing bag. I love it!! 
I bought these for my sister and she wears them all the time. She says that they are the best fit she has found in any maternity pants. I would recommend them to anyone who likes to wear pants all the time 
These hard to find little shirts are perfect for your new little one, no over the head to upset them. Love the long sleeve also. Amazon has done it again. Fast delivery and great products. Thank Yo 
I love these undershirts. They are better than onesies especially for newborns. Onesies slip over a baby's head whereas these shirts don't. Much easier to dress a newborn. I also liked the "built-in" mittens so baby can't accidentally scratch herself. I told my sister about these and she bought some for her newborn son. She loves these shirts, too. AND...you can't go wrong with white 
The shirt was as described. Fit well, washes well, colors vibrant. My nephew loves it 
I've had this shirt for over four months now and it still hasn't faded. It's made out of thick material, and looks good, too. Excellent shirt 
This bra is great! I have never owned a more comfortable underwired bra in my life. It gives me all the support I need, and the fit is great. You will not be disappointed if you buy this bra, and the price here is fantastic 
This is a great product-excellent support-holds up well in the wash and maintains its form thoughout the day. I have always had a difficult time finding a bra that has functionality as well as style and comfort!! This product does all of the above,and very well. Definately a great product and a I give it a strong buy recommendation! 
This Bra lived up to it's online description. It gives excellent support and survived washing in the washing machine and the dryer. I recommend it, especially for full-figured women. 
I love these one of my friends sugested that I get a pare. If you have not tried these you need to 
I'm 13 and I I love to wear these boxer-briefs because they are so comfortable. I've been into puberty for about 2 years now. They tend to ride up the legs a bit when sitting down. They aren't as thick as the fruit of the loom boxer-briefs, which is better because they don't get as hot. After they are washed and you wear them, they are pretty tight for the first 10 minutes, but after that they are just so loose on the legs. You start to loose some of the support your looking for. I would suggest to get a size smaller than what you really are. I'm a waist size 29 and I should be wearing an XL but they are too loose so I wear the L. Try it out and see if you like them. They are awsome for camp outs and swimming and anything than gets you moving. Great support 
These have a nice fit. I recomend them for all occasions, especially campouts, hiking trips, backpacking, or anything else that is active. These are even cool enough for school locker rooms. 
I ordered three of these. They are very nice and keep their shape washing after washing. I love the bright colors which also handle washing well. My only quip is that they seem to creep up a little bit and I have to extend them back down. I usually don't work out with these tops but they could easily handle workouts in terms of their stretch and retaining their after wash shape. They have a bra shelf on the front and that makes it nice but there is not a whole lot of bust support in terms of acting like a real bra. However, I still might order these again for casual wear or for a little active wear in which I'm not jumping around alot 
I got these for my 14 year old niece. She wears them with jeans or cargo pants and loves them. Very cool 
I bought this wallet and it's really nice, exactly as it looks on the picture. I totally recommend it 
I just received my wallet today and must say that I am very disappointed. First of all, it doesn't have enough compartments. It might be ok for someone who only carries an ID and 4 additional cards and nothing else. The card slots are very tight and not made to fit more than one card in the same slot. There is no spare key holder and no storage behind the ID card window. The fabric inside the billfold is so thin you can see right through it. This wallet is cheaply made, unlike the Fossil I currently own, which has held up for over 5 years. What a waste of an Amazon.com gift certificate 
If you have a tri-fold preference, this is a great choice at a great price. Good for guys who don't carry a bulging wallet. If you don't have a tri-fold pref, maybe you should give it a try 
I am so glad to be able to buy a parka like the one I bought years ago when these coats were more popular. That one was wearing out badly and I was concerned that I would not be able to get one like it again as you just can't find them anymore in the retail stores. (It seems that being warm/smart isn't "cool" or in fashion anymore) The hoods on these kind of coats are excellent for cold windy winter days. I tried a few of the military outlet places and wasn't satisfied with their quality. I was so pleasantly surprised to find this parka for less than the military outlet stores! The only thing it lacks is a inside lapel pocket, but I guess I can learn to live without that 
This is a good shirt and I like it. When I ordered it ended up being a bit too big for me so I am having the sides tailored (bring them in). Be sure to get the right size for your body 
I bought these shoes to wear with my Hickey Freeman suit as I wanted to try something from traditional cap-toe oxfords. I have to say I love the style, but I'd classify them more as dress casual than dress formal. I'll still probably need to find another pair of dressier oxfords to wear with my suit, but for gray slacks these are perfect 
These are the thickest and most run resistant tights I have purchased. While still looking pretty 
I love these boots - they are soft inside with thick sheepskin lining. The purple color was lighter than I expected but I like them anyway 
Nice boots, quick shippin 
I purchased these boots, the sand colored ones in Feburary, and I have to say that I am getting so many compliments! I haven't used them as much as Id liked to with this crazy weather we are having on the east coast, but I am not displeased one bit! They are so soft inside with the sheeps skin and they fit great under jeans! Definetely by this product! They are cheaper than uggs and just as good of a product, even better 
These are terrific. The fit and arch support is great, the quality of the suede and lining material is wonderful, and the lining of the boot keeps not only your feet warm but your entire calf as well. These were definitely worth the money. Very well made, beautiful color assortment, and I'll be ordering more pairs in other colors 
Shoe is good and service on delivery was in a timely fashion 
I was pleased with the delivery time as well as the purchase itself. Thank you 
i loved loved these boots i live in alaska and o its cold out here and the bear paw is the best i have most colors i have uggs also most colors i didnt know of bear paw until my friend from california got me some for xmas i called her and told her you must of paid alot for them cause they were way better then my uggs the dark color dont fade like my uggs did they kept me so warm and they did streach and get all lose like my uggs did toltaly spoil your self with these! when i found out how cheap they were i had to get most every color in tall and short! they are awesome i totaly love them.!!!!! 
I purchased these for less than $20 once all discounts were applied. I have to say these were a fantastic buy! I have purchased 15-20 pairs of shoes and boots from Amazon over the winter due to their fantastic sales but i believe these are my favorite so far. They are very warm, comfortable and easy to put on (they basically slip-on). I got these in Black/Firefly. I wear them with jeans and cords alike. They go with everything. They are waterproof. The faux fur at the top has a double function, it also prevents any rubbing which occasionally occurs when i purchase boots of this type. If you buy these you wont be sorry, they are very well made and incredibly comfortable for a fashion boot. 
These knee-highs fit perfectly and are soft and comfortable, and truly opaque. This was not the case with most of the other knee-highs that I have tried. The only drawback that I found was that when I wore them with chinos, there was major static cling (in Jan.) which made them stick to the slacks and not look too great. So I'm going to wash both slacks and stockings using fabric softener and see if that fixes the problem. I hope it does, because these knee-highs are the best I've found and fit so well. Also, they stay up no matter what 
A comfortable, soft, well-made trouser sock. I am very hard on socks (I tend to walk around in stocking feet a lot), and have worn these several times with no runs or tears. Will definitely buy more 
Very sexy and comfortable. But the line does show through my dress pants, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, I love these 
Great little scale that gets the job done for a bargain price. I like that it freezes the highest recorded weight measurement on the screen for your review 
These thong panties are a way to serve up some romance for not very much money. They're inexpensive, feel great, look better. I love the scalloped lace, love the way it wraps around me, leaving no panty line. Wear these with a skirt or tight fitting pants and it'll look like you've got nothing on at all under your clothes. These are a hit with me 
Panties in front, thong in back, gorgeous band around the waist, can't ask for more than that in a panty. I like the way they feel, the hot way they look. My girlfriend Sara sure loves them and I can see why 
These are the panties I wear every day. They feel good, come in colors and there is absolutely no panty line, at least not one me. And the best part is not only do they feel good on, they look good two. I know this, because my guy Jack never takes his eyes off me when I'm wearing them, which is a lot. I brought several new pair of these to our lingerie party and they were a hit, everybody loved them. Maybe Love Fifi should give me a commission 
This thong fits me great. It's cool and comfortable. Has a wide waist band that keeps it in place nicely. It is a bit difficult to get it back in position after the men's room without half undressing 
These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical mens undewear but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought "thongs are not for "real men" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. If you've never owned a thong, I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the Calvin Klein Body thong 
I really love this sandals, the fit true size. Got a lot of complements with them. The color is as you see it 
I was most happy with the quality of the undies and the speed in which I received them. 
I love Calvin Klein shirts. They fit slim and tight so they're not for everyone but if you like that fit then they are for you. Be careful thought because CK makes some cheaper shirts that don't hold up as well, but these Stretch ones are terriffic and worth the price. The Spread collar is nice because it's not too huge-- I read that if you have a long face (as opposed to round) then a spread collar is best, and that seems to be true. 
Ordered seven shirts for groomsmen in a wedding wearing linen suits. Really like how shirt has no front pockets, gives the shirt a classic look. The shirts are of good quality, they wash and iron up nicely. There are regular, tall, and large men sizes available. Shipping was speedy. Would gladly do business here again. 
I love the Calvin Klein brand of clothes, and have been a loyal customer for quite some time... So I was visibly delighted to see CK shirts at such great prices on Amazon... Selected, Purchased, Shipped and Delivered in no time.. I am very happy with this product. It has a lovely feel and lives upto its brand name... Definitely go for it! 
Great feel. my husband usually buys 100% cotton dress shirts. this has a slight sheen to it. nicely dressy, not disco 
Im 13 am getting into puberty. This underwear helps alot in school because I get sudden erections. One time in gym we were changing and I looked at another guy and got one and thanks to these briefs they hid it so no one saw it. Also their a big hit with your boyfriend to cause my bf loves it and he wears them for the same reason 
Received item timely and was in exact condition as described. Great seller. A ++++ 
I just ordered this slimmer and I love it. It is such a good idea to get one of these even if you dont struggle with weight it just makes you look slimmer than you are. It fits great and the material is perfect. It is not all cotton so it wont stick to whatever you have on over it. It is a satin like material so it gives you a nice lean silouhette. 
Nice shirt that arrived quickly and I would not hesitate to do business with this company again 
These are great with the comfort waist band and the 'no tag'. No complaints about itchy tags or elastic waists. As for the comment about 'no fly'. My household of 'litle men' actually like those better. Honestly, who wants to try to 'manage things' through the little 'fly opening' ayway...lol These worked out much better, especially during potty training 
I bought these for my son when he was two years old. It's very hard to find boxer-briefs in size 2T-4T (xsmall)! I wanted underwear that he could slide on and off easily by himself when going to the bathroom. The very soft waistband in particular makes this really easy. They fit well, hold their shape, are very soft, seem very comfortable, and are cute too! He's three years old now and still enjoying them. 
This boot is nicely made, but uncomfortable if you have a wide foot 
Very comfortable !!! Perfect heel height and nice looking. You can't ask for more 
This pair of boots is surprisingly comfortable. The heels are not too high, it's about an inch, making it less painful for a whole day affair. I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want the strain associated with wearing high-heeled shoes 8 hours a day and yet wants to complete a professional/elegant look 
PJ's arrived within days of the order. However, the bottoms were mismatched. Taking the phone number from the invoice, I made a call to the company and found a friendly customer service voice. A replacement pair was sent within days. I am a huge online shopper and this is a great site 
Lyskey's/Ryon's provides a wonderful selection of western wear at very reasonable prices; however, the quality that won me over is their great customer service skills! They help you out in any way possible and are very prompt at shipping your order. If they don't have the item you ordered in stock, they will often substitute it with a similar item in order to expedite your shipment. The hats are of good quality, and the prices are right! The 20X Toyo Panama Straw Cowboy Hat is wonderful for kids 
I have a just-turned 12 yr old girl with a rather large foot (size 10 women's) and these look cute and are comfy for her without having the typical heel that I usually can only find in her size. I bought her the silver ones and they fit comfortably (although they say here they run small, they fit her okay in her regular size) I cannot attest to the durability of them yet because she just got them, but I think overall because it is the Skechers good reputation and that they were an excellent price, that we made a good deal 
These were exactly what I was looking for. They are very comfortable to lounge around in and for working out too 
Didn't run when I put them on, weren't too tight (I'm pregnant--everything's too tight!), stayed supportive and firm, didn't run all night (including at the wedding dance--I was a bridesmaid), and I washed them out and they still look brand-new. These are awesome nylons. Color was light enough so they didn't look fakey (I'm super pale), and they held up great. Wow. I've found my new favorite brand 
I originally bought these pantyhose due to the "Hue" name -- I thought it referred to the Vietnamese city, and I thought these would be the pantyhose that you can wear in the jungle as protection against leeches. (The leech DOES attach itself to your leg... but because of the sheer nylon screen between you and the leech, the parasite is simple to remove, merely by taking off the pantyhose.) Anyway, this is NOT the jungle-warfare protective pantyhose for use in swampy terrain... but it does look good, it IS comfortable, and I was quite happy that accidentally found it. P.S. If you use nail polish to repair a run in these pantyhose, I recommend "I'm Not Really A Waitress," even though it's red, and will look like a glossy little drop of blood on your leg. If someone does happen to notice, you can make a little joke about it (a good ice-breaker) 
Certain styles of Hue pantyhose, along with certain Burlington pantyhose, have become my favorite pantyhose to wear. I bought the hue Sheer Age Defiance pantyhose in tan, a size 3 and I am very pleased with this pantyhose. This pantyhose fits me very well and is very comfortable to wear. I enjoy wearing this pantyhose and highly recommend it to other people. 
These shoes are dressy with all the comfort you'll ever want. I love 'em! 
These are without a doubt the best socks I have ever worn. They are not too thick and not too thin. Very durable and comfortable 
Gold Toe makes the best socks I've ever worn, and I've been buying them for as long as I can remember. Normally I would get the cotton crew socks but decided to give these a try. These are a medium heavy cotton sock that fits well and will probably last forever. They may seem a bit loose at first, but one washing will pull them back into shape and keep them up. Furthermore, they are a little thicker than normal socks, but not as thick as a wool rag. So, consider how your shoes fit before getting these. If they are snug, these sock will just make them snugger. Finally, I like the color selection on these socks. Oh, yeah. Believe it or not, Gold Toe has a fantastic customer service department. I sent them some digital photos of some socks I can't find anymore and they matched them up. That, and Amazon's prices are worth 5 stars right there 
I am absolutely thrilled to realize that I can buy Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies from Amazon. I now have no reason to go to a department store in a mall ever again. It is particularly exciting to order more than $25 of socks in a single order and then track their (free) shipping by UPS all the way from Coffeyville, Kansas to my home in Massachusetts by way of such exotic stops as Oklahoma City, OK, and Earth City, MO. I ordered 3 each of the new Denim Heather and 3 of the Olive. I also ordered two of the less-expensive three-packs in Navy and Black. I love the name Denim Heather, and I am really excited about wearing these to work on Monday morning. The Olive socks were not as green as I expected: they are really a shade of Brown. I own many pairs of Brown Cotton fluffies and I fear that sorting my laundry in artificial light may prove difficult now with the inclusion of two shades of Brown socks. Time will tell. 
after wearing these shoes every chance i get i have finally found the need for a new pair. they need a lot of breaking in at first but then they will eventually mold to your feet. and the steel toes keeps you feet safe as well. perfect concert shoes. perfect everything shoes, really. 
man made doc martins need major breaking in. order a size to small if you have thin feet the steel toes run big 
I just received my skort and I loved it so much I placed an order for more. I checked the merchant's sizing chart before I ordered and a medium was exactly as it says it is - a 4-6, which is what I wear. I also got loads of compliments at the gym this morning where I wore it for the first time. It keeps me from having to yank down my shorts everytime I stand up. I also prefer a skort instead of looser fitting shorts so no one can see my panties during certain exercises. Skorts are the best invention in women's clothing for active women in decades, IMHO. This skort is perfect for casual wear or for the gym. I can't wait to get the others that I ordered - one in every color 
I understand why others might be unhappy with this skirt - Andrew Christian usually sells things that are for people on the skinnier side. I am 5'2 and 85 pounds, and a x-small fits great. Andrew Christian, however, does have a problem with their shipping. Do order quick 
I like this skort...it is great...just what I was looking for and delivery was super fast 
this shoe is the most comfortable running if have ever had. Thanks 
Bought as a gift for my son. They were true to fit size, comfortable and a very good price 
Very disappointed by this bra. Not at all like the picture. If you are anything above an "A" cup, avoid this item. 
I bought this for my wife and absolutely love how it looks on her. I wish she would wear it more often 
When working in an office with a blouse on you really can't go bra free. (Much as I'd like to. This is the next best thing. Everyone can see you have a bra on but if the guys look close they can see your nipples too, or can they. One thing is for sure they will never know for sure and will never dare ask you. So you get this 'naughty girl' feeling. Not to mention the sensation of your clothes rubbing on you nipples as you move. I like to wear it best with a white blouse, above the knee skirt. No panties. I feel wicked all day long 
I have this bra in white. Very nice. I couldn't stop caressing my breasts and my nipples. Strongly recommended. Wear it under a sheer peasant style top and fitted jeans 
These are WONDERFUL!!! I love them so much, that I am going to get a pair in all 3 colors...lol. I just ordered a pair for my mom for Mothers Day too. I think they'd be a great gift. They are softer than I thought they would be...amazingly soft. I wish I could wear them all day :) They are going to be perfect for summertime. Also, I have a lot of foot problems (neuropathy), so I really needed something that was soft, comfortable, and made well. I really can't say enough good things about these!! 
Arrived on time and it looks good on me, but the fabric is a bit fragile...I would buy from this seller again.. 
I just wear these around the house. I like the light comfortable fit. Quality seems good for the price being under ten dollars 
These ducks are great quality and add to my kids collection of tub toys. My daughters love playing with them 
these undies keep my balls warm in the winter and cool in the summer and that is important 
Very comfortable with a nice snug fit. These briefs are stretchable to adjust to 'size' and very breathable. Definitely a sexy and fun underwear 
very comfortable shorts. great material. i run w/ these shorts. and, i like them 
Item arrived in new condition, packaged nicely, invoice enclosed and on time! No complaints 
Three things: Feels almost weightless; always dry; never catches. The best running (or just lounging around the house) pants currently made 
ordered on the last day for shipping prior to the holiday, and the product was delivered with time to spare. the product is great; i only wish ihad ordered the right size 
I'm not a fan of bras, but as a 43 year old woman with a fairly small chest, I was stunned at how well this bra gave me a whole new look. It is definitely worth the money and I even just recently purchased a second one. 
Nice comfortable fit and keeps the boys in one place. The sizes seem to run a little small as compared with Jockey so I might suggest that you buy one size up if you do not like them too tight. They are soft, comfortable and reliable. I think the elastics wears a bit fast but you cannot beat it for the price. Also, some have complained that the fabric is too thin. Hey, for just over a buck each what do you expect. I like the full fit as opposed low rise version. Haynes also has higher end undies made of thicker faberics, and faberic wrapped waistbands. These are inexpensive, basic undies. - 
I'm 16 years old and normally I wear boxers, nothing else. Recently I purchased an 8 pack of these briefs for excercising and because I thought I ought to give briefs another try after 6 years. At first, it was a bit strange, but I quickly came to enjoy the feel of this style of underwear. They don't bunch up or give you "wedgies" like boxers do because of their looseness and center-seam design. They provide support for your male stuff and stay in place throughout the day. People tend to believe that briefs are "too tight," hence the term tighty whiteys. If they're too tight, you bought them too small. Simple as that. These briefs are perfect for wearing any time in any situation. I thought I might feel self conscious while wearing them, but the comfort of them overshadows any of that. If anything, I'm proud. Overall, I recommend you give these briefs a shot, no matter what underwear you tend to prefer. However, despite being pre-shrunk they do shrink up a bit after the initial wash. I'm a 32 in boxers, but 34 in these works out great 
I love these - I've had many brands and hese are the best 
My husband wears a size 13 shoe. Finding any socks that fit him properly is IMPOSSIBLE. The heels of the Gold Toe socks are actually at the back of his foot (where they belong!) instead of in his archway (where other brands land). Out of 20 pair of socks in his drawer (even long, thick ones for the winter), the Gold Toes are still his ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. He walks to work in NewBalance shoes and Gold Toes...and never complains about comfort (even in sub-zero temperatures!) Give them a try...you won't be disappointed 
I am very pleased with this shirt. The material and workmanship are great and it feels good wearing it. What else can you say about a shirt 
I've gotten many compliments on these shoes! I love how they look, they are made of a soft material so they are comfortable, but still cause sore feet after shopping all day in them. But that's the cost of looking cute 
This is the best purchase ever... it's really comfortable and it did covered all my expectations! I live in a tropical weather and it works on perfection... it's warm and don't let cold get in at night 
I thought I would write a short review for the a3 Outrunner as I could not find any info on this shoe anywhere on the Internet, when I was looking to purchase this model. The Outrunner took me by surprise, It offers a nice narrow heel, snug midfoot with a medium to high arch height with the traditional adidas 3 stripes for an adaptable snug midfoot fit, narrow to medium forefront with a narrow to medium width, medium to high depth toe box. The low profile sole is not cushy at all and is perfectly supportive yet nicely flexible with a very smooth heel-to-toe transition. The shoe feels very light on the foot; I would have guessed around 10 oz. As it feels so light, yet after putting the shoe on the scales it weighed in at 13.5 oz. In my (men's) size 12. The a3 Outrunner was an excellent addition to my shoe lineup and was an excellent bargain from Amazon.com considering their low sale price combined with the [...]and the [...]. I would buy this model again without even batting an eyelash. The a3 Outrunner offers a great fit! I always size up by a ½ with Adidas running shoes over all of my other running shoes and the fit is right on. I hope this review helps anyone seeking info on this model.. 
Best of the ones I've tried. Outside seams cause less irritation to the hand and the gloves offer firm support to both the hand and the fingers. Don't be afraid to purchase if you need the support for only one hand. The special way the gloves are seamed means that both gloves can be used for just one hand, as in carpal tunnel syndrome 
These gloves are great to wear if you have arthritis in your wrist, hand, or thumb and are a wonderful support following hand surgery. Almost all other writst/thumb support devices have seams that press against the tender surgery areas, but these have the seams on the outside of the glove rather than on the inside so tender areas stay protected! The gloves are machine washable and very easy to use. Plus they feel great 
I really love these jeans! I tried them on at the Children's Place, and they fit me perfectly! This is rare, because I am really tall and skinny. I like the "Earthy Wash" the best, and I also like the "Rinse Wash". I think that you will really like these jeans. If the modern flare doesn't fit you, Children's Place has lots of other styles. -Gracie, age 1 
This item is exactly what it is described as, a perfect ultra-light yet durable garment bag. Very spacious with lots of storage compartments for various packing needs. Expands as needed to accomodate even a 3 or 4 day trip. Light yet durable. Nice 
This accessory is great! Traveling is such a hassle, but this device took almost all of the hassle out of traveling. Whatever I needed it was there and in mosst cases, they checked my creditials with the documents IN the holder.Simply put your driver's license in the bottom window and boarding pass in top window with info displayed and you are set! I highly recommend this for anyone who travels 
This really came in handy on our recent travels. everything is right there and handy. Regular airline tickets fit nicely, preprinted airline tickets from home computer takes some work to get it into the pouch. Very pleased with the product overall 
I had ordered this dress on a Friday for a photo shoot the following Saturday. I had it expressed and it arrived that Tuesday. Just as expected, the cut is extremely figure flattering and it looks absolutely amazing on! Even though I had to order this in a larger size in the brown as the red had sold out in my size, I was very pleased with the fit. It is far prettier in person than in the photo shown and wearing it I felt like Ava Gardner. Ladies, you can't go wrong with this dress! 
I ordered this Sunday night, and it was shipped out the next day before 5pm. I got it Friday. It was exactly as the picture online, the color matches well (pink was more pink and less coral than in the picture). The fabric feels wonderful! it's very similar to the "How to Lose a Guy.." dress but in my opinion, i like the back/neckline better on this one. The mermaidy tail is gorgeous and the length is perfect (5'10ish with heels). The size also matches well with the chart. All in all, this dress was more perfect than I'd hoped for and I'm very happy with it. It looks/feels very glamourous! The only thing on the downside is that this type of dress isn't lined, so you can sorta picture the outline of belly button and even no-VPL panties 
Loved my boots, I bought them in white, brown and black and pink, for the price, I could afford colors I may not use very often, like the pink. Fit great, felt great, look great!!!! 
These are so cute. Plus the background is glittery which you can't tell from the picture. My daughter loves them 
Daughter loves the boots. Waterproof but not for snow as there is no lining to keep feet warm 
the slippers fit well (not always the case with on-line purchase). they were delivered promptly and a very good value and excellent all-around slipper with traction. The only downside was a limited availability in alternative colors 
I gave these booties as a Christmas gift to my sister. She loved them. We both really like the chinchilla lining; it's so soft and warm. I would recommend this product to others. I have given other styles of Acorn slippers to friends and family. I also have a pair of Acorn slippers. I love them 
These are really nicely made..They are super soft on the inside and have stayed that way over numerous months of wear. They are warm but don't make your feet sweat, and they don't get lumpy on the bottom. These are high quality slippers, they look nice and are very comfortable. 
I am a huge Nautica fan and these jeans were an excellent price 
Good shoes at the price. Nice style and comfort 
These are great sandals. They have the velcro fastener which is so helpful to people like me who have arthritis. They feel great to walk in and are very well made. Excellent shoes 
The shoes were the right size when they arrived. The shipping was promp. Everything was good about the product 
bought another one as they've added color options - we just love these and wow what a great price - good merchant, ships fast and reliabl 
The garter fit great but i dont think barbie could fit in the panty. It said plus size but some how i dont think they realized what plus size is... for sure not a size 2. Loved the thought though that my client thought enough to buy this for me off my wish list here on amazon. Huggs Lizz 
I just recieved the nightgown and it is beautiful. I was hoping it was a little lomger (i'm 5'8"). The gown drapes to just above my ankle. The jacket shoulders are wide but do not drape as much as I'd like. However, the lace fabric is comfortable, the underwire really shows off the breasts, and it really does look sexy. Love it 
Pleased with the Dockers and feel it was a great buy 
This gown is great..would like it better if it were cotton 
I was very specific looking for this gown. I bought it in the navy color because I wanted to be sure it wasn't see through. I live in Singapore where it's very hot and humid year round. It's common for me to have to take 2 showers a day. So, in the evenings it's nice to put this lightweight sleeveless gown on to help stay cool. I love the length and because of the way it's gathered around the bustline, it's loose fitting and not obvious you don't have a bra on. I'll definitely be getting another one or two of these down the road. 
I usually enjoy this brand and type of nightgown. Its comfortable, wears well, and very pretty. That is the reason I'm buying sight unseen. I'm sure I will enjoy this as well as others I have purchased 
This dress was made with quality workmanship. It is delicate and flows very nicely. I bought it for my sister's wedding in May and received a very good deal considering it would have cost me considerably more retail 
I really love this dress. It is a little more low-cut than I realized. Also, the flowers are a velvety material and the white backing shows a bit. If neither of those points turn you off, though, you will most likely be very happy with this purchase. 
These are truly wrinkle free and longer than the average womans botton down, which I love!! Overall, these are fabulous shirts and you can't beat the price 
I have been on a quest. It is not a quest of time and space, but of clothing. I have been seeking a truly wrinkle-free dress shirt for women. Oh, I've tried men's dress shirts, but they look so, well, masculine. I've tried women's stretch shirts (with spandex!) but they wrinkle into a little ball, just perfect for that pitch into the trash can. I've bought wrinkle-free shirts from Chadwick's, Lands End, Villager and others and was disappointed. They weren't bad, but they weren't good. If I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison. There were always wrinkles in my shirt. Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them, but never really neat looking. My friends, my quest is over. I have found the women's dress shirt that wears and washes like a man's. This Women's Wrinkle Free Dress Blouse by the Foxcroft Shirt Co. has met my high standards. I stays neat all day (even after a brisk walk in warm, humid weather) and washes beautifully. I washed it with my husband's shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies. It looked as good, if not better, than my husband's permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt (or wrinkles, as the case may be). The price tag is more than I usually spend, but considering the time that I will not have to spend ironing, it's worth it. I plan to buy it in each color. 
The perfect shirt! Good quality fabric and stiching. Excellent fit. And the bet part...NO IRONING! I wish it was offered in more colors 
Foxcroft shirts feel great and are truly easy care. Worth the money 
When I ordered Lee Jean's for the 1st. time on Amazon. It was the fastest and safest way I could of ordered. I consider this service "Excellent" I now will order through Amazon.com it's the best way to go. Thank You for all your service's snip019@aol.com Laura " from Clifton, N.J 
They were delivered quick and fit great. Wish I knew who I was writing this review for, so I could buy some more. 
Jeans were here in no time. I was in awe of how fast they arrived. Can't say enough about the service. Still in awe 
Great wear in cold weather, they are comfortable, and they look cool. If u r thinking about buying them... DO IT!!! O they look grat with Black and white All Star Converses and a navy or royal blue long sleeve shirt 
I love these shoes. They run a little wide considering they are a narrow,but I think they will be fine for the summer months. They were shipped quickly with not incidents. Thank you 
The quality of the shirt is great. It was delivered in a timely manner. Keep up the good work 
I really like this boxer, is so comfortable. It lifts your rear area and kind of enhaces the front. Tha short leg style is awesome. The colors are quite sober 
I was very pleased with the Dearfoam Slippers I ordered for my mother for Christmas. I could not find them in my area so this was a big help. They were shipped in a timely manner and received in good shape 
Rapid shipping, good quality, items were as represented 
What drove me to purchase this item is that I was first looking for Boxer Briefs and I found Hanes was offering a good price so I bought 6 pair. I own several pair of Boxer Briefs that are 2-3 times as expensive, but I'd have to say, the Hanes is pretty darn good for the price. I know this might sound corny, but I actually look forward to putting them on. I recently converted from briefs and I am now sold on the BB's 
Excellent all-around shirt. Very durable for a hard day's work, yet good looking enough for a casual night out. Very comfortable. The tall sizes really have extra long sleeve length which I appreciate. I bought three 
These boots are soooo comfortable. My only complaint is that I bought them in "sand" and they are closer to light pink. It depends on what light I'm in. I wanted a shade darker but they were sold out. All in all, I'd pry buy them again 
These are my favorit pair of winter boots! I have 2 colors already I plan to get more. They are warm, comfortable, and can be quickly slipped on with or without socks. I love the soft, sheepskin lining 
I am in love with these boots-- I currently own them in 4 different colors and adore them.. WARM as ever and fuzzy for great cushioning.The only thing i warn is to buy them in a size smaller thanyou normally would, as they do stretch a lot... My 1st pair were an 8 and they became way too big on me after a few months of wearing...The other 3 I bought in size 7 and they are perfect! I would definitely recommend them to anyone!! Amand 
These are so well made and looks awesome. They are so comfortable and the lining so plush. There are no irregularities around the edges or stiching. Wonderful craftsmanship. They looks so much more expensive than the price. I am getting a couple of other colors. Highly recommend it! 
I bought these pants for my husband who is a general contractor and is out on the land all day long. He thinks they are just about the softest, most comfortable loungers he has ever put on. I have to admit I have stolen them for myself once or twice. Thank you, they make me happy as well because I get the enjoyment of snuggling next to them each night 
SOFT AND SLICK LIKE SILK. EASY TO TURNOVER IN BED. GREAT PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND. MAZEN 
I bought these for my fiance. He loves them and they look and feel fabulous 
I actually ordered these sleep pants as part of my oldest son's Halloween costume. I was really pleased with them when they arrived. My son liked them so much that he decided to sleep in them after Halloween. He says they are very comfy 
I was extemely satisfied with my purchase of the Intimo Men's Satin sleepwear, or should I say my son was!! I purchased them for my 14 yr old son for Christmas and he loves them! 
for a boot with a 3" heel, these are VERY comfortable. only annoyances are that they are a little slippy (no traction) and the cute heart on the bottom is only painted on, so after wearing them for less than a day (though i did go to the mall last night) the part that touches the ground is completely worn off. not horrible, they just should have made it a part of the sole. definitely a good buy overall 
I really liked the boots once they arrived, I couldn't beat the price for these boots. They were alittle stiff at first, but once I broke them in they fit terrific. I use them for dancing and they are very comfortable. I would definately recommended them to anyone looking for a style of boots like these. 
These slippers make a fantastic gift. When I bought them to replace a loved-one's worn out pair, I received lots of praise and unsolicited compliments on how comfortable and great they feel on your feet. Indeed. I wish I had bought a pair for myself, but my current pair are still in OK condition. Maybe someday 
Slippers are comfortable, but tend to run a little small. Nice option for the extended sizes 
My husband loved his slippers and says they are the best ones he has ever had! Good quality, nice looking 
This bag is perfect for everday use; the long straps make it really easy to carry, and it awesome for carrying notebooks. The canvas material is very durable and has held up really well, even with heavy everyday use. The only thing that I don't like about this bag is that there isn't a pocket on the side 
Product just as described. Fast shipping, packaged great. Thank you!!!! Will most definitely purchase from seller again 
Given the low price I was expecting a pair of gloves that would survive maybe one winter. However they seem very sturdy, thick leather (so it does take some wearing to break them in and make them softer) and they go well with business apparel. I like the back zipper look but I've had some people turn their nose up to it (guess it's a good thing they offer them with and without zipper) 
I really needed a wallet that had more space for credit / debit / discount / membership cards. I also needed something that wasn't so thick it would cause me to sit off-center and create back pain. This wallet performed as expected, took care of both problems, and looks good! The only two downsides are that it's a little too tall for standard depth pants pockets. This just means that I have to be a little more watchful that it doesn't fall out or get stolen ... but keeping an eye on my wallet is always a smart idea! The only other problem is that dollar bills are not easily moved into our out from the side pockets. It's as if the pocket is the exact same length as the dollar bills themselves, which makes quickly stowing and retrieving money a little cumbersome. My solution was to just lay the money over the cards and close the wallet on it. It now makes access to my money even easier, and I have had no problem with anything falling out. Overall this is a good product and would make a unique gift 
I love this product. It lets me keep my cards in order so that I can use them when I need to. My business cards such as credit card, ATM card, etc. are on side. My medical cards such as dental, vision, eye care, etc. are on the other side. I love the easiness of it. It's the best card wallet I ever had. I'm happy I have it 
its what i needed for all my cards ! you cant go wrong with this product . and the price was perfect . 
The slots for the cards are not wide enough for the card! The only way this can be used is to place the cards in lengthwise and hope they don't fall out. Lovely leather case but pretty much useless 
These shoes are excellent. They run true to size, which is unusual today in many brands. I have owned several Rockport shoes and all have been spot-on on size. They all, as well as this style are very comfortable. These shoes are well crafted, stylish and can be worn as casual or dress in all day comfort. Amazon had good prices and quick delivery on these shoes. 
This is a high quality item that keeps me warm in the house and out. Stylish too when I go to the kids' soccer games 
This jacket is a great find! The price is unbeatable for the quality.. it is so soft and plush. It's very warm, and not heavy at all. It fits true to size. I have the color "Bullet" and its a solid medium gray. It looks great with everything from jeans to sweats! I can't wait to try it out on a cold winter run 
OK, I admit it. I was a bit skeptical about ordering this shirt because it looked kind of tacky in the photos. But since it was on a Friday sale, I ordered the Asian Pear color, which is really a light beige or tan (I thought it might be kind of greenish, but no). I'm 5'8", 135 lbs, with broad shoulders and long arms. I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug. The quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snaps closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. I like it! It isn't tacky-looking in person, but it's definitely different. If it goes on sale again, I will buy another color 
The "Jockey Elance" bikini cut panties are comfy and well made, without giving up cute and sexy.They are cut just right with full coverage in back(yes there are those of us that still require this),a nice semi-high cut leg, and the waist band fits just low enough to wear with moderately low waist pants. They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort. The 3-pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after laundering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings. This style may also be found at "Bare Necessities" The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini. This one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other styles, these are the best in quality and comfort. OOOOkay...so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear, it's a product I thought worth a review. You NEED these!....Happy Shopping......Laurie 
My hubby loves these boxers,they are something that he's wanted from childhood. The only slight downside to them is that I recommend that you either hand wash them or have a delicate setting on your washer 
i bought the maroon and forest colors of these silk boxers and my boyfriend loves them. i wish i had ordered more!! great present for our two year anniversary they are still in perfect condition several months later. he says he really likes them due to the elastic waist and the really smooth silky texture. highly recommended 
The silk boxers arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend loves wearing them along with his matching silk robe. What a wonderful Christmas gift they made! Thanks again! :- 
I ordered the silk boxers but unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) I broke up with my boyfriend (the intended recipient) before I gave them to him. So now I'm waiting to meet someone who is a size medium and would like some nice silk boxers! But they sure seemed nice 
Though I prefer flannel and cotton boxers, I needed silk boxers for a long hiking and camping trip. (Silk has great moisture-wicking and quick-drying properties.) Under nylon shorts, the Intimo silks managed to keep my Special Fun Area reasonably dry even while hiking in driving rain. When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. They lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of durability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washings. Obviously they got kinda crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them. As for this boxer/brief/thong controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. If that means boxers, fine. If it means a thong, fine. What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns. Women consider all kinds of ridiculous things stylish, such as hairless pets, square-toed shoes, pointy-toed shoes, the Monochromatic Look and the music of Andrea Bocelli 
As previously described, the sensation in your skin is great but I would not use them to go to work. I only use them at home and they really feel nice. I will probably order a couple more. It's also works great as pajama shorts 
I still have not recieved this item that I ordered. I did get the star spangle shirt and love it but I have yet to have recieved this one and am not sure of who to contact about it. Please let me know how to go about getting it. I was under the impression I would have recieved it a number of weeks ago (it was part of a going away gift of my better half who is deployed to fight the war now) and still have not had word or recieved it. Thank You, Holly Padill 
I just got this dress and it is adorable. You can wear it as a dress or a shirt with jeans or leggins. It is easy to dress up or down. Great buy for the money. Extremely flattering and comfortable 
I do a lot of yoga and need clothes that not only look good but are comfortable and cool while sweating in a warm yoga room. I own a lot of Prana clothes from rock climbing which have always held up well so decided to purchase this top even though I saw it worn by a celebrity. I've had it over two years now and have not been disappointed. It keeps me cool and looks cool too. You can't go wrong with it 
I bought this tank for my boyfriend almost a year ago, and it's held up great! I originally bought him the khaki-colored one and he wore it so much I got him the black one for his birthday. Definitely high-quality and well made. 
I have this sandal in black but I have the l-1/2" heal. I cannot believe how comfortable this sandal is to wear all day. I wore this shoe traveling several times. You can wear it with jeans, a skirt or shorts. I love it as a travel shoe because you don't have to pack a lot of shoes due to it's versatility. The leather is very soft and it has velcro closers for the ankle and toe strap. The velco is great because it can be adjusted quickly. Your feet are never the same size in the afternoon after standing all day! 
As the other reviews note, these pants are incredibly soft, comfortable, and a very flattering fit. I absolutely love them. They are fantastic for wearing during yoga, pilates, cardio machines, and low impact or toning activities. However, please be aware that the more vigorous and rapid your movements, the pants may not hold up at the inside seams (I wore them during a high impact class with lots of very deep lunges and kicks, and the inner thigh seams seemed like some of the stitching was a little frayed by the end of the class). So save these wonderful pants for low impact activities and enjoy a truly great product that will make you feel great wearing them 
These are the softest article of clothing I have ever owned, I love them. I wil definitely buy more of this brand.. 
I can't believe how soft these pants are. They're like no other yoga pant I've ever worn. They also fit really cute. I wear them to yoga all the time now, and fellow students almost always ask me, "Where did you get those pants?" They are flexible and totally comfortable as well 
I used this folder to pack a dress to a wedding in the UK from the USA and it completely saved my life!! I arrived with no access to an iron or anything, but thanks to this folder, my dress stayed wrinkle free and beautiful (along with all my other clothes I had for my trip.) No tell-tell wrinkle lines. All I can say is I'm a believer and will never travel with out these folders and pack-it cubes. This system from Eagle Creek has completely changed how I pack - and how I look when traveling. 
The Eagle Creek Pack-It Folders really do work. Whatever is in them stays 95% wrinkle-free. I hesitated a long time before buying one, since I thought they were on the expensive side. But I travel about 6 - 8 times per year, and the folder has proven to be well worth the money for the time and aggravation saved. The 18 model seems to be about the right size for men's shorts. I also use it sometimes for slacks, and my petite wife finds the size workable, too. Also makes a nice gift 
I bought a white one of these bras at the hospital baby boutique after the sales person fitted me. Then I bought the other two colors at Amazon.com from a 3rd party seller that was offering free shipping. I was surprised to find any nursing bras that fit me. But the hospital boutique was able to find 2 or three styles that worked for me. However, this one was the only one that was not an underwire bra and I hate underwires. This one is comfortable enough to sleep in. I wear them with the Medela Cotton Washable Bra Pads. The only drawback is that it looks like a sports bra with no separation, but with my size, I care more about comfort than looks. 
I have found this bra works well with my Swaddlebees organic nursing pads. You can't see the pad out-line when you wear them both. 
The Bravado Maternity/Nursing bra is very comfortable for daytime wear, so I would highly recommend it if that is what you are looking for. The way in which the bra opens and closes makes it very easy and comfortable, and it doesn't create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras do. After the first few weeks of wearing this bra, I had no doubt that I had made the right purchase. On the downside, as others have mentioned in their reviews, I did notice that as time went on the bra seemed somewhat less supportive. Along the same lines, this bra bothered me to wear to bed, because my breasts always seem to fall out of it. I know I was wearing the correct size, so maybe this was due to the low-cut criss cross shape of the bra. Whatever the reason, I found it quite irritating and uncomfortable to wrestle with my breasts in the middle of the night!! To be fair, I had the same problem with another(different brand)nursing bra also, so maybe this is just what happens when you try to sleep in bras. Consequently, I ended up buying a sports type bra for sleeping. Overall, because I only used this bra for daytime wear and I resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to wear breast pads with almost any nursing bra, I really liked the Bravado bra and would definitely recommend it. 
wonderful shoe! Beautiful to look at and great to wear. Would love to get more in other colors 
I recieved these shoes for Christmas from my mother. They are absolutely gorgeous! I'm a heel fanatic, but these ones are really head turners. I wore them out the same day and I noticed alot of people looking at my shoes! I was worried the silver glitter would fall off easily, but so far I havent noticed any coming off at all. The only problem I've had with these shoes is that the toe area rubs on one of my toes and that hurts, but I've had this happen with alot of heels so I dont really consider this too much of a drawback. If you love gorgeous shoes and dont mind a little bit of pain, these are perfect 
I've jumped rope for 7+ years for cardio and just purchased my 4th pair of these. I have a a cheap plastic one and a weighted rope (this everlast leather weighted). The plastic one costs only a few dollars that I use if i'm traveling for more than a couple days, and sometimes to mix it up. The weighted rope is a good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well. This is my 4th pair because the others have eventually cracked through, which happens when it drops repeatedly against the floor at a bad angle. One of them also just wore out in the center where there's alot of friction with the floor. I tried another plastic handled brand, but that cracked around the same area as well, and even sooner. This is a classic, and fully recommend. it didn't receive 5 stars only because it needs to be replaced every couple years. but then again so do all the others. Highly recommended 
This is nothing but a nylon bag and a zip loc mylar baggie. It didn't work to keep things dry at a recent trip to the water park despite double bagging. All that was in it was a set of keys, some cash cards. These items managed to push open the seal of the mylar baggie. I would not recommend this 
Everything was OK. It would have been great if the turn off switch worked. I have to take the batteries out when I'm not using it 
This shoe is extremely comfortable and stylish. The shoe gives you the effect of a higher heel without discomfort. I am thinking about finding these same shoes in black 
The merchandise is impeccible, the service was timely and I am very satisfied. Thanks for a smooth transaction 
This item arrived earlier than expected, packed nicely and my hubby loved it. No problems with ordering or shipping. Thanks Amazon 
This was just what I was looking for... Extremely comfortable... I want to wear it every day 
pretty nice, a little smaller than expected. if you're not sure what size to order, order the larger of the 
I ordered these shorts for running and they are perfect for it. I love the short length. I ordered a large, and i'm normally a medium, and they are still a bit snug 
I wear bandana's pretty much year round and also use them for other various things, from tying things together when backpacking to making yourself visible on the road when riding a bike, these things come in handy. The main thing here is the price...your not going to beat this price by buying them at a truck stop or shopping center. Truly a great deal and what would you expect for a great product 
I am so sad because my Samsonite umbrella actually broke yesterday, blown inside-out in the huge wind storm we had. One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half, so it's pretty much a lost cause. That said, this is an excellent umbrella. The auto-close feature is so handy if you're going to be in and out of the rain a lot, like going shopping on a rainy day. While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrellas shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color. The small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so. If the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars. However, if you can resist using it during a nor'easter, give it a try - it's an excellent product 
I have many pairs of Clarks clogs, many needing replacement now after sev'l yrs wear. I have purchased a few pairs recently and do not find them as well made/ comfortable as my original pairs of 3-5 yrs ago. I wonder if they changed their fit/ style/ manufacturing. I still wear them as they are better than other brands, so far. Overall, love Clarks. Am recently disappointed 
these socks are packaged nicely, great for babies 0-9 months. colors available are good for any type of outfits 
These really do stay on. The cuff gets tighter after a run in the dryer - thats why I didn't give 5 stars. Dry on a low temp if at all 
My boyfriend is a Big Lebowski fanatic, so his son and I bought this for him one Father's Day, and he loves it. The only issue I had with the shirt is that we got an extra-large size and it still fit a little tightly (he's not a huge man). I also think I remember noticing that the graphic was a little crooked, which was not very noticible unless you looked more closely. He still appreciated this gift, though 
Great conversation starter. It always draws compliments from people I can connect with. It's the Dude fellowship 
It was such a thrill to see the Chicago Bears win the NFL NFC Championship game and this shirt will always serve to trigger this wonderful memory 
Even though the Bears did not win this years Superbowl, it's important to realize they finally made it to the final dance, after all those years of having average or below average seasons. When it comes to a Superbowl win, it's basically a coin toss (no pun intended) on who will win. We're talking about two great teams (in this case, Colts and Bears) and the Superbowl is basically just the two best teams battling it out. NFC champs are the Chicago Bears. That's the important thing to remember. This t-shirt should proudly be worn, even if you don't live near or in Chicago. The Bears were a great team in 2006. With this shirt, you will always remember the amazing year they had 
This is a good looking shoe. It's Comfortable. It seems to hold up well. the Material is a little bit plasticky. I guess it's waterproof. the cushioning is good 
The "Top Jock" line of jocks by Lowry is damned impressive. They are lightweight, provide great support, fit well and are well constructed. They don't feel like you're wearing a jock. The contoured woven pouch is the perfect size and works well to absorb moisture. The look and feel is really terrific. Way to go 
This jock does the job; it hold your package in place and does what it's supposed to do. Cheap and easy to launder 
i commute to work on my bike in the winter. this would not be easily done if it weren't for these thermals. they're very cozy and you don't notice them when you're inside a building 
I absolutely love this jacket and just bought a second one. Has stood up through some bad storms and kept me dry. It is fully adjustable with velcro around the wrists and on the back of the attached hood which actually allows you to adjust the height of the hood. The hood also has a nice wide visor which helps keep the rain out of your eyes. There are 2 side pockets, 1 chest pocket, and 1 inside pocket. The jacket can be completely stuffed inside it's chest pocket for backpacking or long term storage, although I have found this is difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort. It is also very breathable for such a waterproof fabric and any sweat seems to dry quickly. I couldn't find this jacket in women's sizes so I went with a men's medium which fits a women's large with room to layer a sweater underneath. Overall, highly recommended to everyone 
It works fine. It's seems very well constructed and it was comfortable to wear (even in the humidity of Jamaica). I probably would have prefered fewer compartments but someone may find all of them useful 
Exactly as described. I wear a size 7 shoe so bought a size large and they fit exactly right. Wash like a dream 
This is the gift to give the women in your life who can appreciate comfort and classic style. Cushioned inner soles, sturdy bottom soles, soft and beautiful upper material, no pressure points, perfect fit, warm, classic style that goes with pajamas and jeans, stands up to machine washings--what more can you ask from a house shoe? Give yourself the gift of these slippers, too, in every color. 
Found them easy enough on the web site, I received the item pretty quickly and my wife loves them. That makes her day, and that's just fine with me. : 
I live in these slippers. The flexible leather soles are cushioned and insulate your feet from cold floors. (Be sure to select the style with leather, not vinyl, soles.) If you need more warmth, wear them with a light sock. The stretch satin holds your foot in place. When a pair finally wears out, I often have to go out of my way to find another. This year local stores were sold out, and I found them at Amazon. 
I bought these slippers for my office so I can kick off my shoes when my feet are tired and slip these on. They are classy and so comfortable. I don't think anybody notices I'm wearing slippers. I plan to buy another pair for home 
I would definitely buy this product again and again, and Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase any type of product. Great customer service, fast shipping, excellent prices. The product was perfect. Thanks 
The fit was a bit large, but they have lovely thick padding for your feet. Nice sole allowed dancing. I wore them under my long fancy dress at my daughter's wedding/reception because I have Rheumatoid arthritis and can't wear dress shoes. They looked great. Now I wear them around the house every day. Not as hot as regular house slippers. Plan to buy more colors 
Easy to slip on and very comfortable around the house. Even looks brand new after washing in the machine. I only wish I bought more so I won't ever be without them! Also very transportable so you can bring them with you to a friend's home, which is etiquette in Europe since we only wear houseshoes in the house 
i love my boots. never thought that i would like anything dr scholl. i have had more comments on these boots than any others that i have had. someone saw these on sale at famous footware and they were 40 dollars, so this was a great buy! will probably end up buying one in every color. i got the light tan color. very comfy, sturdy, easy to get in and out of, great in snow, not heavy 
The boots are very comfortable and stylish. I always associated old and ugly looking footwear with Dr. Scholl's. I would highly recommend these. They were very reasonably priced also 
Bought these shoes for my husband. He always loves the Bostonian brand shoes. He had no problem with a need to break in these shoes. He wore them all day the first day and he says they were completely comfortable. The shoes are excellent quality, good value for the price and are really great looking. Dressy enough for a suit but casual enough for khakis and a shirt 
I bought this back when it was on sale when I was still an employee at Sears and I was definately not dissapointed. Being a 3-in-1 jacket has several uses. First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends. Only downside, it seems to be a magnet for pet hair. ALl in all, very satisfied with my jacket. Starting to get a bit small now so I'll definately buy a larger version and sell the old one 
Good quality socks. Wear well, wash well, are comfortable to wear. Would recommend Wigwam products 
I bought these jeans for my husband and he loves them and so do I. They look great, and still look fresh after many months of washing. Would buy again 
This is the cutest purse! It's large enough to carry everything that I need, but at the same time it looks cute and small. The shoulder strap isn't really functional, but you can tuck it into the bag and carry the purse by its two hand straps 
The stitching on one of my gloves didn't reach all the way around the wrist area and caused a loose fit. The padding is really thick. Some people may think that a lot of padding is a good thing - but it was too much for me. I wouldn't buy these again. Two stars instead of one because of cheap price 
I don't have anything to compare this too, since it was my first 'wicking' technology pair of shorts, but I must say it has lived up to my expectation 
This product was what I expected. They're a little light/thin, so I wouldn't recommend them for yard work, but they're great for running and playing basketball 
This is a great shoe and I have no regrets about buying it. Pros: Perfect balance of good looks and comfort High quality construction Non-slip sole  Cons: Sole is very squeaky on certain surfaces Clarks use the British sizes, so be careful when ordering your siz 
Okay so I've been a competitive swimmer for quite over a decade, and my family and I bought several Ugg boots....probably a decade ago.... before they became the trend that it is now. Simply put, I love them. If you want your feet cozy and warm and happy, then you can't go wrong buying this. I have this style and two different others, but speaking specifically of this Ugg slipper style, it's the best thing to wear around the house. You can put on right after you get up in the morning and take off right before bed or if you need shoes to get something in the cold garage or just because the kitchen floor is too cold that socks aren't enough. I've worn mine so much the cushion/lining inside is worn almost bare, but remember I've had mine for so many years. That's right, they last you that long, and it still offers more warmth than most slippers do 
Gave these beauties to my wife for Christmas and everytime she puts them on I get a big hug and kiss...so far that's 22, but who's counting. She tells me they run about 1/2 size large (she wears 6.5/ bought the 6...fit is perfect) and feel absolutely fantastic on a cold winter night. The only problem, the brother-in-law hates me now since he didn't get her sister a pair...HA!HA!HA!...sucka 
The best thing about these slippers is that they keep your feet warm but DRY. I'd take putting my foot into these at the end of a hard day over a foot massage. That's how comfy they are. They also have great support and nice soles. They're cute, comfy, sturdy and worth every penny 
i was skeptical, but these are well made with great foot support and warm! they handle our wet northwest weather beautifully and they clean up nicely. Less expensive than the Ugg boots, they are less bulky and great for indoors too. 
the body suit fit perfect. well let me be politically correct, the leotard was an absolutely perfect fit. the material hugged the body just enough to feel comfy 
Received in specified condition, customer service was very easy to access and talk to. Thanks 
Fleecy happiness has made my toes content with life 
The luggage arrived fairly quickly. This is the 2nd item that I have ordered from this seller, and have not had a problem. The luggage is expandable looks very nice!! The only drawback is that the tag on the luggage says that is has "add a bag loop with security buckle", but I see no way of linking the bags. However the luggage was only 39.99 when I bought it last week, which definitely makes it worth keeping. The price has doubled since then 
speedy delivery.... decent price and product.... it just looks a bit chea 
This adapter will take your US plug, even the ones with one prong wider than the other, and convert it to a European plug. One thing to note, this adapter is not a voltage converter; it will not convert European 220V to US 110V, unlike what one reviewer said. Shouldn't be a problem at if your power supplies support a range of 100-240V like most mobile devices these days: laptops, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Just read what's on the power supply or device you're taking to Europe. 
No comment. Everything is OK ! Regards, Cristia 
The adaptor worked great in my trip to Germany. Worked with plug that had one prong slightly larger than the other. 
The cloth shoe bags are roomy enough for a pair of men's dress shoes and very durable. The draw sting closure makes it easy to open and close the bag. I brought them for traveling, but have decided to store my "better" shoes in them 
The slippers were really nice and received in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, the person that I purchased them for didn't care for them, I had to return them. Thank you for making the return of items so easy 
My wife and I both got sheepskin slippers and we wear them all the time while we're at home. They are very comfortable, warm and seem very durable. The heavy soles are great for going out to the mailbox or running down to the corner store for a pack of smokes. We'll definitely buy more when there wear out. Regarding my previous comments, I'd like to amend it. I've had my slippers for just over a month and the inside of one of the slippers has holes in it above my toes and is giving me blisters when I wear them without socks. I've never seen this happen before and can only assume it's related to the quality of construction. I won't buy these again 
These slippers were a christmas present for my husband and I haven't seen him without them since. He often remarks that his feet almost get too warm! Beautiful slippers and extremely comfortable. Well made and worth every penny 
I brought home an Italia jersey from Italy for my Polish husband's birthday recently, not figuring that the European sizes are smaller. When the Italia jersey was too snug, I found this Polish Postal Team jersey and ordered it a size larger (as the site recommends) and it arrived today(2 days later-love it!) My husband is really happy with it. By ordering a size larger than his normal size, it fit perfectly! The jersey is very light weight, great for Tennessee summers, and zippers almost all the way down the front, another nice touch when it's warm. It has 3 large pockets in back to hold "stuff". I would highly recommend this jersery as my husband came back from his ride raving about how confortable and cool it was. And, the graphics are really nice, too 
I just got these slippers, and I must say I love them. if you follow the chart, and pick out the correct sizing, the pair you pick for your size should fit. Mine fit perfectly. The sole is not a true slipper, it has plastic dots on the bottom. I would say these are good for lounging, reading, relaxing in bed. These are nice to keep your feet warm if your feet are always cold in bed. Also these could make nice car socks. I am going to wear these when I travel to Japan to walk around on the plane. The design is very nice also 
Comfortable, stylish for a 40 something without looking like I am trying to look 20. Not for walking in all day though. Looks great with jeans, skirts or shorts.. 
I just ordered these recently. They are super comfortable and adorable. I would highly recommend them 
I love these sneakers, I wear them all the time. I now have them in two colors. I bought them for $40 in a boutique in Venice CA for $40 and found them on Amazon for HALF! Amazing. SHOP AMAZO 
Fast and easy service, it got here even before I was expecting it 
ah man. i have 2 vote for pedro shirts. there both awsome. i would wear this shirt anywere...... even to a wedding or something. it makes me happy when i wear it 
The shipping on the shirt was more expensive than the actual shirt. It is of good quality and arrived quickly 
The election of Pedro in the movie "Napoleon Dynamite" symbolizes the ultimate victory for the underdog based on popular appeal to the majority. I smile everytime I remember the line by Napoleon to the kid who just got bullied into giving up his lunch money: "Pedro offers you his protection." Wearing this shirt is truly saying "Power to the People!! 
I love wearing my Vote For Pedro tshirt to show how much I love the movie Napoleon Dynamite. People who know Napoleon Dynamite will smile at me when I wear it. Great shirt 
I was pleased with my purchase, it arrived in a timely fashion and was as advertised. I would buy from this store again 
It was exactly what i was looking for and an important piece for my halloween costume. They accidently sent me the wrong color but I had no trouble exchanging it. : 
This is a superb fitting and quality unitard. Excellent fit and very well made 
I surpised my new boytoy with a white, semi-transparent,long-sleeved footed uni. With a little persuasion, I have gotten him to wear it around the house and occasionally under his street clothes. What I like most, is that the tight, slick, shiny fit really shows off his sexy bod and leaves very little to the imagination. Buy one for your beau, girls, and I am sure you won't regret it 
I love love love these shoes! They took one night to break in and now I can wear them for hours, even hours of dancing without any discomfort...and they're cute too 
I recently purchased this rolling briefcase and used it for the first time last week. I am very satisfied with the briefcase. I had to travel through several airports and the rolling mechcanism was smooth, the handle was very long and it has plenty of room for my oversized laptop and many other personal items. It comes with a separate bag for laptops, but I choose not to use it as it just takes up more room and adds to the time to go through security. The front zipper compartment was perfect for the quart size zip lock bag you are now required to have for airport security, plus it held my book and snacks for easy access. The top straps allow it to be looped over the handle of my rolling suitcase. It is easy to lift and store in overhead compartments. I highly recommend this product 
If you've ever had to carry your laptop bag over your shoulder while rushing thru the airport, this bag is for you. It ROLLS!!! It's lightweight, but sturdy, holds your laptop, all your accessories, and you can even get estra goodies in there, like your jewelry, medication, books, etc. Women especially will like the bag. And unless you stuff really really full, it fits in the overhead or under your seat. My shoulders love this bag and so do I!! And the best part is the price 
Whoever shot the photos for this bag did a great job - the bag was not as nice as it looked in the photos. It also did not fit the oversized laptop that it seemed it would. The wheels didn't seem like they would take much abuse, and the organizer pockets were cheap plastic. It earns points for color selection and for the handle. All in all, I sent it back despite the fact that the eBag policy is to only give a partial refund. 
I have been very happy with this briefcase. I am a first-year law student and use it heavily for both my books and my computer and it is holding up well. I would recommend it highly 
I'm a meeting planner and travel quite a bit with my job. I also have a lot of things I have to carry on rather than check. As an example, on a recent trip I was able to pack two laptops and two 1" 3-ring binders, along with my makeup bag and a few other small necessities. The bag is made of sturdy fabric and the wheels roll smoothly. The telescoping handle pops up and collapses quickly effortlessly. The bag also comes with a detachable shoulder strap which I removed because (1) my bag is always too heavy to carry on my shoulder and (2) when rolling, the shoulder strap often dragged on the airport floor which caused it to get dusty dirty. Fortunately, this bag has two short handles which make it easy to lift when going up stairs or moving it to an overhead bin. I highly recommend this bag and at this new sale price I'm thinking about getting one for my personal laptop too 
Eexcellent pair of shoes. Durable, weather resistant and they still look nice enough to wear to the office on a rainy or snowy day. True to size. Great company 
These briefs fit great an for the low price they are you sure can get some wear out of them. 
All I have to say is that I love these shoes. I bought these shoes for work but now I'm thinking that they are too cute just for work. They look great with everything. True to the size. I am a 7 1/2 bought that size fits great. 
My husband picked these out for me - and I love them! I never would have picked them out myself as I thought that they would be uncomfortable but they are great. They look fabulous with jeans and I have received many compliments. 
I got this boots in the mail with my other bandolino shoes I bought here. I tried them and its comfortable and fits perfect. I can wear them with slacks or jeans. Its well made. The heel is perfect. I love Bandolino shoes. Its a good buy 
I love these boots! I brought them in the bone color...right before the holidays and have worn them several times since. I'm not big on pointy toe shoes because my feet are slightly wide, but I got them in the regular width and they are very comfortable. The heels are the perfect height too...just tall enough to be stylish without the clumsiness or lower back discomfort. They are classy looking and go well with any outfit, whether I wear them with jeans or with a suit. The fact that they come to the ankle is also a bonus when you're driving or sitting. I've received so many compliments when I wear them. The fit is so great that I'm even thinking of getting another pair in black 
My sister has refined taste in clothes, so I was relieved when she recieved the socks with much enthusiasm. Paid a bit much for them, but thats the price you have to pay for buying online. The socks resemble the picture accurately. I am pleased with the product 
I am very pleased with this product!!! It was exactly what I needed for my strapless gown. I wanted something that would smooth me out without causing unwanted bulges in my back (the dreaded "back cleavage"). This camisole is fairly easy to wiggle into and it's very comfortable to wear - not too tight at all! I also liked the length of it. I found the other stapless camisoles too short. They would cause my stomach to stick out below where they ended. Not attractive at all. I would highly recommend this product. I was also extremely surprized how fast it arrived. It took only two days for it to arrive!!!! Very impressive 
Versatile shoe appropriate for both jeans and skirts-- comfortable enough to wear all day long without blisters or foot pain. Highly recommend 
Even though these briefs are Boss's "entry level" range - the quality is high - making them excellent value for money. The shipping from Freshpair was excellent too, the goods were well wrapped and sent by Fedex. I am a very satisfied customer 
It is definitely worth buying. great shipping speed and the quality is excellent 
These are great tank tops for wieght training! Overall material quality is good but not the best. Great value. 
We LOVE this sling!!! Often wonder what we'd do without it as it works it's calming, sleep inducing magic on our son about 99% of the time. It seems like as soon as he gets in he's in his own little cozy womb-like world and he just drifts off... It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. bunched up) as possible generally remedies the problem. It's easiest (I think) to put the baby in if you guide their head in first, and it's also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person. This is our most used piece of baby gear by far - my husband even gardens with it on! Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old - he's 2 mos now and 15 lbs and there's still plenty of room for him in it. Also, it works well to breastfeed baby while they are in it which is an added bonus when you are out and about. I would also recommened NOT getting a light color (ours was a gift) because it starts looking a little funky after you dribble your dinner down it a few times 
I am pleased with the sling. It is much easier to get baby in and out of than a pack-style carrier yet baby is secure - and we've put it through the paces, chasing around 20 month old big sister. One caution - takes a little practice to get comfortable using it. Also, I ordered khaki thinking it would be neutral so it would go with about anything but dark enough to not show everything - well, it looks a little too much like a Brownie (Girl Scouts) sash when baby isn't in it for my taste 
This is a great carrier. I really enjoy the close contact with my baby. The pillow is needed for newborns, she is 6 days old now and I am loving fatherhood 
I wasn't sure if I would recieve white stockings because the picture displays black ones, but I received them in white. They fit great on my girlfriend and she loves them. She had a hard time finding solid white thigh highs in stores and these are perfect. 
O acabamento do produto raramente é encontrado no Brasil, desde as costuras, qualidade do bordado e detalhes referentes ao time. Os materiais usados na confecção também são de boa qualidade. O modelo se encaixa bem na cabeça e é recomendado para quem não gosta dos modelos "Trucker", aqueles com a frente enorme 
I love Saucony shoes because they seem to be the only shoes that I can wear without pain. I am a registered nurse and having bunions on both feet causes increased pain after being on my feet at work especially. I had a pair of Saucony shoes that were very comfortable but had just started to look their age. After hunting unsuccessfully for replacements I went to Amazon.com; ordered two pairs and I can't tell you how happy my feet and I are!! I would like to be a Saucony spokes-person because I LOVE these shoes; they make my work and ultimately my life better!! Thank you for making wonderful shoes; please don't stop 
These socks are the most comfortable white socks that I have found! I love a good thick wool sock but these little guys fit snuggly and are a great option in the summer and for use in athletic shoes 
I wore these for a while but made a switch to other brands -- these socks are by far the best! I'm getting me a few pair of these 
I wear nothing but gold toes. These are a great price and are the real thing. Nice to have my socks while on the road 
Best socks I've ever had - and I've had every brand out there. These fit, wear well and are comfy 
They are the best quality socks I've owned. I've owned a lot, and will continue to buy them! 
The socks were sent and received in a timely manner. They are terrific socks at a good price and I am very happy with my purchase. Life kind of takes on a whole new meaning when you have such terrific socks at a terrific price. My life has changed for the better since my purchase of the Gold Toe Men's Cotton Liner Athletic Sock 
Although this product came marked Birko it is the same as the original Birkenstocks I have had in the past. It is the same fine product 
these betula sandals are soo comfortable. i spend a lot of my day walking, and these get me anywhere and everywhere. after just three days they formed right to my feet and i never want to take them off! the quality was surprising very durable, however during rainy/snowy days they'll get damanged so i suggest you don't wear them then. anybody who doesn't have a pair and is interested should definitely consider this pair, they're amazing! : 
I have two pairs of these sandals, replacing a similar pair ordered years ago from another source. Very comfortable, and should also last several years. Size chart instructions let me order the right size with confidence. The vendor shipped promptly. I received what I ordered, when I expected it, at the price I expected. One can't ask for more than that 
These sandals are OK. 4 star quality of material which makes it pretty good, but the size system is completely off, so that makes me want to put it as 3 stars. I'm an 8, but i ordered a 7 and i still have some room to spare. I wish i could send it back and receive a 6 but too much work, and i guess i'll just deal. **I feel that maybe a 6 would give me a firm size (one where theres somewhat no squirming ability), so thats why i decided to stick with a 7. I hope that this "size review" helps out a bit with your choice of size.** If youre ordering these sandals be prepared to take one size down or two or else you'll feel foolish with such big sandals. Besides that, the shape and form of the sandal is quite nice. Its quite comfortable, because after all it is a licensed birkenstock. Plus the price is right compared to the other birkenstocks. Thats why its moved up to 4 stars 
Amazon got a perfect 10 on product and the timely shipment of it. Good Job 
We bought two clothes line to Honduras. This one and the "Rick Steeves" - this was by far better. It was longer, it had suction cups (which actually worked) and little plastic clips on both ends. I lost one suction cup end but it was fine because I would loop the line around with the use of the clip. It also was a loose weave so we could use it to hold the items (we didn't bring enough small clothes pins). It worked great. 
The coat came just as it was getting cold and breezy here in TN. It has a nice fleec lining that came handy while I was fishing in my boat. It is not recommended for "very cold weather", but it is a very good "cold" weather jacket 
This jacket didn't disappoint. It isn't rainPROOF, but for walks to the bus stop, etc, in the rain, it does the job, and has a cozy lining to help keep you warm. Generously sized. I'm very pleased 
I was very pleased with my order of the jersey. The quality was excellent, and it was delivered in a prompt manner and packaged nicely. My son loves it, wore it to school the day after the Super Bowl, and it was a real hit 
Although I thought the jersey was a bit pricey, it was a huge hit with my eight-year-old grandson! The quality is excellent. I know because he has worn it at least four times a week since he opened the package on Christmas morning! I was really surprised and delighted to find his size at Amazon.com. I had combed all of the stores in our area and had also gone online before I found it at Amazon.com. I realize now that Amazon is more than a book store 
I got the item fast and in great condition, just as I expected 
the fit is perfect, fun yet conservative! the fabric is breathable and not sheer, it is apropriate for dance or ther aerobic activities, and also it can be worn under pants or as i shirt or as a camisole, IT IS STUPENDOU 
the shop did a wonderful job shipping my items right away - i had no problems, both items fit great, and the scarf i ordered is so versatile! also, the prices were amazing. thanks 
Very fast shipping...received my item a week before schedule. Product was the same as the website description, would purchase from again 
This leotard is awesome, especially for the price. You can't beat it. The cut of the legs is much more flattering than it appears in the photo. Runs true to the sizing chart. Only problem is no bra or lining so it wouldn't be good for anyone with a large chest. The material is thick though. no show thru, so anyone b cup or smaller should be fine. I am ordering more in other colors 
This is a great leotard.It is very comfortable and fits well.I love wearing it while I am doing my workout tapes.It is great to wear while working out.It goes well with any workout no matter how hard it is.This leotard can handle the most highest impact and the toughest toning. It is also great to wear when I am doing my yoga, tai chi, and stretching tapes, it handles and moves well with the most intense stretching.It also feel so good when I am doing all these tapes.I also wera it with pants or shorts when I go into the gym.It is also good to wear with skirts and slaacks when going out on the town.You can also wear it under your clothes while you are at work or college like I do,very comfortable.Then I go home and I`m ready to go for my workout routine just have to slip out of the clothes and I`m wearing my leotard.This is a great product I would reccomend this comfortable leotard for any body who want to be comfortable during their workout such as yoga,pilates,kickboxing,high low impact aerobics etc.This is also great to wear at dance class,anyboddy who goes to jazz,ballet,tap,modern,etc,this is great for you girls to wear at you classes.I give this leotard 5 stars. 
Very nice cap with good construction. Great price and selection of colors 
I love these boxes because they take me straight back to my childhood - doing my best to stay at home long enough to see He-Man before I went to school. I associate He-Man with my earliest childhood memories. Anyways, great boxers for what they are. Would never pay $20 bucks for them and even passed up $4, so my Dad bought them for me for Christmas. Big Lots had them months ago at $4 a piece, marked down from wherever they got them. Get them, don't get them.. whatever... check big lots first. They aren't long boxers, so if that's what you prefer keep moving. 
Sorry, I couldn't resist the awful joke. I received a pair of these for Christmas from a friend who knows my fondness for the cheesy '80s show. I often wear these shorts while exercising. The fabric is nice and comfortable. The printing is good, and has not faded much over a year and a half. My only complaint is that He-Man's quote is wrong. He should be saying "I have the power," not "I got the power." Maybe, as some reviewers assert, women will not find you attractive if you wear these. As a woman, I don't find that to be too much of a problem. However, one man has commented, because of the logo on the backside, that my behind is the master of the universe 
The other reviewer cautioned that if someone were to purchase these boxers, he would not be successful with the ladies. I am a lady and a rather attractive one at that and I can assure you that a gentleman with such distinguishing taste as to wear He-Man boxers would get more than a passing glance. With the literal, but adorably suggestive "I Have the Power" on them, they achieve nostalgic innocense and at the same time a sexiness that can only be achieved by a deep appreciation for all things 80s. How could you possibly look cuter unless you were to actually wear purple furry little underwear over your tights like Adam loved to sport? I have been searching for a pair of He-Man boxers for a very long time now and I will definately be ordering a pair of these for my man's birthday! -Hillary DePiano is the author of the She-Ra Collector's Inventor 
I bought this sweatshirt for my husband for christmas, it's a great basic. He already has two other American Apparel zip-front jackets. However this is his first hoodie from AA... One problem is that the drawstrings have frayed at the tips and look messy. Usually sweatshirt strings are protected at the tips and only wear out after the plastic cracks on the 20th wash. These aren't protected. This product is mostly fantastic 
The Nancy Ganz Boyleg looks great and offers good tummy control. It is not visible under clothes and it is very comfortable. However, the lace does not last for a very long time. 
I purchased these shoes for my son who is somewhat hard to please at times but he likes these quite well. The look and feel of them is great in his opinion, he thinks they are stylish and very comfortable. He slips them on everyday after work 
I have been wearing Bike Swimmer/ Jogger supporters everyday now for the past 4 years. They are extremely comfortable and durable. They are also well worth the money. They are the only underwear I will ever use 
Great bra for the the full figured woman. Beautiful bra with wonderful support. Best of all it's comfortable. I own several of these in different colors, and have been wearing this style for several years. Highly recommended 
I bought this bra here on Amazon and have been very pleased with it. It is supportive and fairly well constructed and I wear it in a big size. I think it is definitely worth the price I paid for it 
The Vanity Fair Satin Solutions Full Figure Underwire is very comfortable to wear. It hold up well and the wires have stayed in place. 
I searched for these pants and only after putting the style number in online was I able to find them on Amazon. Although I paid a little bit more for them, I will order more colors. These pants are great for everyday wear and comfortable for working out in the gym. Plenty of pocket room as well 
The pants are great and the service was Awesome. Will purchase again from this seller 
Hi y'all! When my wife became pregnant, she was worried that she would have to constantly expand her wardrobe as our wonderful growing child expanded her belly (yeah, I know babies grow in uteruses, but "belly" just sounds so much cozier). These Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands allowed her to wear her normal pants and skirts with the waists undone all the way up to her sixth month. After our child was born, my wife had no more use for the bands, but I didn't want to see them go to waste. I have always been pretty trim, but I wondered if the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands might work for a growing beer belly as well as a growing baby belly, so I began to eat and drink excessively, allowing my belly to grow. My wife thought I was being idiotic, but I told her that she had had her turn, so she should let me have mine. After gaining fifteen pounds and a noticeable paunch, the waists of my pants no longer buttoned comfortably. I undid my pants, wrapped my belly in one of the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and threw on an old oxford shirt. After buttoning just the top few buttons of the oxford, I looked as if I were wearing a particularly snug, extra-long, patterned t-shirt underneath. I went to my local watering hole and none of the guys recognized that I was wearing an article of my wife's clothing! I have now become a big fan of Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and have bought additional bands to add to my wife's collection. Well, I suppose I should say "my" collection since I'm the one wearing them. If my wife becomes pregnant again, I will, of course, share the bands with her. Who would have thought that my wife's pregnancy and my frugality would result in the sharing of clothing between me and my beloved? I joke to her that my "child" is due any day now, and then rub my belly lovingly. My wife gives me a strange look, sighs, and then just shakes her head. I know she's just jealous, so I tell her, "Hey, all you have to do is become pregnant again if you want to wear these Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands." "I don't know if your fathering another child is such a good idea," she replies. I ask her what she means, but she just shakes her head and says, "Never mind. 
This item is the most comfortable thing you could ever put on. Please be advised if you need support and plan to wear it in public..you will not have much support. 
The Barelythere Microfiber Crop Top Bra is the greatest bra since the beginning of the bra back in the times of the Greek empire. It feels great, fits great, and wears great. I feel you cannot lose in purchasing this bra. The strap, the bottom band, the cups feel great. I think you will love it 
The product arrived in great time and nicely packaged within the box. It is very comfortable and wears well under all my blouses/sweaters. I will definitely consider buy other products from this company and this type of material 
I hate wearing bras, but this is by far the most comfortable bra I have ever worn 
I nurse my infant, and I like to wear this bra at night for support. It doesn't have any hooks or uncomfortable straps and is lightweight, yet gives just enough support. When I nurse my infant, it's easy to just slide up, and also accomodates nursing pads that do not shift. I bought mine at Kohls on sale for about $8 
I've spent a lot of money and time trying to find a comfortable bra and the microfiber crop top bra is the best I've ever worn. Definitely worth the price! It's as comfortable as being without a bra yet gives support 
Amazingly comfortable bra - the lack of hard/stiff fabrics really makes this nice to wear for extended periods. I have issues with irritation from seams &amp; elastic touching my skin; so these all microfiber bras really are great for me. The price seems high, but as long as you launder gently and air dry they last quite a long time 
I'm a nurse. I wear one of these everyday at the hospital. If you're looking for comfort, this bra is it 
ahhhhhh such warmth and beauty! How wonderful to find something different to say, think, and feel in this think, fit, and feel. Yay to all us 'chiks'. Let us allow the wind to caress our hair and skin, as well as to feel the breathe of the Godesses in all Her Exhuberance purify, consecrate, and sing through our voices.....as if She opens a beacon of compassion with each exchange of sacred air that consprires to open the gates to another world of of wonder and love. Sr. Adess 
Excellent product, very comfortable and a very good and pretty model. he is recommendable 
Wouldn't have taken the chance if they hadn't been on sale, but they fit perfectly and look wonderful on. Good quality and well-made 
To me a "basic wool flannel trouser" would be a more classic fit. The very low waist (NOT waist), 4" zipper, too-long, and very wide cuff was an awful disappointment. I own 3 pr. Harve Benard from 4-5 years ago which fit me beautifully - same good tailoring, lined wool - so that's what I expected. I am 5'7" and this year's design drags on the floor and sits down on my hips. The pant legs are 4" wider than my old ones. Also missing here are the side elastic options 
These are one of the nicest fitting pants I've received in a long time. They are very well made and fit my slightly odd figure. I also got a real deal on them which made it even nicer. They arrived in a timely fashion. 
These pants are the best fitting and most comfortable pants I have purchased in awhile! How can you beat this price!!! I would buy more if I could find other colors. Very nicely made too : 
I run most days of the week and wear boots when I'm at work. The offshoot on that is that my feet are usually fairly unhappy. These socks while not a cure all for foot problems have improved my overall foot health and have helped keep me from having recurrences of some of the foot problems that I have had in the past. 
They fit like a glove!. First time a pair of jeans ordered online fit exactly like the customer feedback claimes. Awsome. Buy a pair Of Aura womens jeans today. LOVE THEM!!!!! 
Three Cheers to Wrangler for coming our with jeans that are made to fit a real woman and not some male designer's idea of what our bodies should look like. This is the most comfortable pair of jeans I have EVER worn. Aura also has casual khaki pants, but they're not sold here. 
I just tried on a pair of these for the first time today, and loved them! They're right--buy them 1 size smaller than you're currently wearing in other jeans, and they'll fit comfortably. The denim is a nice heavy weight, with a little bit of stretch to it. I took several pairs with different combinations into the dressing room with me to find the right one, and now that I have it, I can order online with abandon, since they only had denim at the store I shopped at. I don't have particularly long legs but have often found that regular jeans were just a little bit short, only to have talls be way too long. How wonderful to try on the "average" length and have them be just right! I'm ready to toss out most of the other jeans I have 
Thank you, Wrangler women, for the Aura jeans. It's so great to be able to get a custom fit. (In my case that's long -- but not too long -- inseam but regular rise.) I also really like the fabric which has a bit of stretch but looks like regular denim. This is my first ever pair of jeans that doesn't have something about it I don't like. Once I tried these on I immediately ordered a pair in the dark indigo, which is available on Amazon as a separate item. It would be useful to see all available colors on the same product page. I would love them in black and other colors. Just great 
Not only can you not find Uggs (except in very limited sizes and colors) I simply wasn't willing to pay their sticker price. I felt sure I could find an equally comparable shoe for a better value. Well I found it! These are SO warm and comfortable. They have great arch support (which Uggs do not, so I've heard) and they are just as cute as can be! (I got the pink ones!) The Clausette shipped them promptly. They felt about a half size too small, but since they don't make half sizes (like Uggs, which run big I've heard) I knew the next size up would be way too big. Then I wore them around the house for a couple of hours and they seemed to stretch a bit and contour my foot. They are so warm and comfy. Thrifty shoppers unite! These are a great boot at fraction of the price of Uggs! I highly recommend them. Thank you Bear Paw 
I liked these boots so much I bought a second pair they fit great and are very comfortable. The price is even better 
A quality boot at a great price! These are a great alternative to Ugg Classic Short Boots 
These boots are the coolest thing I've had in a LONG TIME. They are so comfortable and I'm happy as a bug in a rug. 
I was gifted a pair of these and had to return them after 2 weeks. I wore them only inside my house just to keep my feet warm. I should have known because when I first smelled them after opening the package, the smell had a chemical hint to it. After a week, the smell on the outside material was horrible. I had them next to my bed and the fumes were so bad I had to move them into another room. I know it's not my feet as I've never had a problem with shoe odor before, and anyway the odor was from the outside materials. YUCK! 
This shirt looks so nice on my baby (blue)! Definitely my favorite shirt. This company has pants and socks that match 
This is a great top for my teenage daughter. It looks great on and she loves it. It can be layered in cold weather or worn by itself in warm. My only problem is that I was not offered a choice for expidited shipping which I wanted. So don't order this if you want it in a hurry 
This scarf is lovely - the color is just as it looked on line, the texture is soft. I'm very pleased with it 
I gave this as a gift to my mother-in-law and she loved it 
I received this as a christmas gift after putting it on my wish list. Its hard to know exactly how large it is, but its a great bag none the less. It is huge, so its not great for an everyday bag. But I use it for work, and it works great, and holds all I need. I have received many compliments on it as well 
I bought this shirt for my granddaughter who is on the middle school dance team. She loves the message on it 
The control top is a definite must. It sucks everything in, as well as smooths it ou 
These are as flattering as they are comfortable. Love the vertical stripe. Perfect for yoga!! Check them out 
A previous review led me to believe that these yoga pants would be longer than usual. I went by this review since the product details do not list the inseam length. I have long legs so I was excited to read another customer's comment that these pants are longer than usual. They are not. They have a 32 inch inseam which is too short for me. Too bad for me because they are really cute and comfortable. I will have to send them back 
these yoga pants are cute and nicely priced. one note: they are quite long, so if you're used to getting high-waters, you'll be pleastantly surprised. 
My 3 1/2-year-old son couldn't wait to wear it. Zipping it up is a breeze and it's really soft and stretchy. He didn't want to take it off in the morning. Also, he's above average in height and weight, but a 3T fit him perfectly 
These are a lightweight material which is perfect for CA weather. And my son looks adorable in them 
Great skin for Zen V player. My daughter loves the color but I like the protection it gives the player. 
I got these as a birthday gift to show off for my boyfriend... needless to say, he had a VERY happy birthday. I have never owned a pair of crotchless panties before, but these are surprisingly comfortable and easy to wear. The best part is the way they make me feel when I'm wearing them... daring, feminine, and downright sexy! They are also a great way to show off a naughty wax :) You won't be disappointed! 
Just the right amount of visual tease needed. and my woman says that there comfortable to 
Customer service responded immediately when I contacted them regarding an exchange. Received my items 2 days after I returned it. 
(wo)Mankind experienced the apotheosis of comfort when someone decided that underwear was good, but taking out the crotch would be even better. In countries like Japan, where the birthrate is too low to support the social medical and retirement systems, giving these out to girls upon graduating high school would have the problem fixed in a mere decade. It is only through the hard work of thousands of years of human history that we can enjoy the benefits of split-crotch panties, male or female. If you are a woman, get a pair. If you are a man, get your woman a pair. Do not throw away into the void your chance to reap the rich, intellectual harvest of generations of hard work in the lingerie industry 
I love these so much, I am buying another pair in black. I wore these to bed with my boyfriend with a simple tank top, and when things started warming up, his reaction to the crotchless aspect was priceless! The bonus was when I asked him "should I take these off?" when it was time to get....closer..., he responded "NO WAY!" Way worth it 
I recently received these from my husband as a present - along with several other Love Fifi items - all of which were crotchless. These pretty French Knickers were the first of the bunch I tried -- and I absolutely loved `em! Over the years my hubby has always given me different kinds of lingerie, all of them mainly ethereal or low-cut, but nothing scandalous. And I think we were both ready for a change. I immediately fell in love with the high-on-the-hips and almost bottomless look of these knickers - and how they made my legs look even longer! The fabric was much sheerer than what I was expecting, but the visual effect was pretty close to what's seen in the photo. These were the first crotchless panties I'd ever tried. And it felt different to expose so much of my cheeks in the back (as compared to other boy-cut shorts I had worn). But it was definitely the feeling of openness in the front - that made me feel the sexiest! I wore these to bed one evening along with a matching-color camisole on top. And even though these knickers made me more accessible (which was wonderful during our warm up), I still removed them (out of habit) when things got more passionate! For more general usage, I could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt - when dining out with my husband (as a tease). But I'd probably want to consider getting a more thorough waxing first! To finish up, I guess I had always thought of crotchless panties as being a little tasteless. But these cute French Knickers - and the other items I received from Love Fifi - were as beautiful as they made me feel! 
My first pair of crochless panties and I couldn't be happier with them. They are very flattering, even for the girl who's got a little extra meat on her booty 
I like these because they are different from most other crotchless panties. I don't usually wear crotchless panties, but I have a few, mostly the high cut kind (like on my Amazon wish list). I'll wear them on special occasions, or when I want to feel daring. These ones have a cool look. Not that anyone but me is seeing them, but you never know 
Forget for a second that these panties are crotchless and let's focus on how they look. They look great, dynamite on the eyes, front, back and sideways. Just absolutely georgous. Every bit as good looking as the Tango Tanga panties, also by Love Fifi that I think really look good. Boy I have to admit when it comes to lady's undies, these Love Fifi people really know their stuff 
I have never, ever before had on a pair of crotchless panties and I have to say that I liked it. Mostly I don't wear panties, unless I'm wearing a dress or a skirt and sometimes even then I don't. I just like the freedom. But these, these are cute as can be and it's like you don't have anything on at all. At least that's's the way it feels. And they are darn beautiful. Darn beautiful. The discovery of these panties have really made this lingerie party for me 
The shirt quality is ok, but the shirt pictured is short sleeved. I was sent a long sleeved shirt. Not what I expected or wanted. The shirt quality is average - nothing really noteworthy 
I ordered this product two days ago and called to check the status. They said the item was not in stock and was back ordered. This is a CHRISTMAS PRSENT!! I wouldn't have gotten it unitl NEXT YEAR!! This company is a joke. Maybe the product is fine but the customer service is a crock, the reprsentative even hung up on me!! If my credit card gets charged by this company, I'll have a come-a-part on them 
This acrylic scarf is so soft and so cute. I bought it in black and wish that I had bought more colors. I does say on the tag, "dry cleaned only" but I washed it on cold and laid the scarf out to dry and its fine. All I have to say is that its a great buy for the price 
These are great for the price but I haven't tried to wash them yet so I don't know if I'll have the same problems as other reviewers. I figure that if they don't wash well, for the price, I'll just throw them out and use another since I bought several just for this purpose (after reading the reviews). I'll have to put an addendum to this review once I've used the scarf a little longer but so far I think they are lovely and definitely well worth the money 
Nice quality and price. A really good value for the money 
This is a truly delightful scarf. It's very soft and buttery, lightweight, and long. The drape is incredible. You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning. Initially, I got the winter lilac color, which is actually magenta. Very pretty color. I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cassis (a dark burgundy). This was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto the first one. Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear. I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet. We had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day. They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy. They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag "just in case." The scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only. I suspect handwashing would be okay, though. Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture. I highly recommend this scarf. 
This scarf is so soft and beautiful. The picture does not give this scarf justice-the colors are much more vibrant and the material is so ultra soft! I gave this to my aunt for Christmas-she loved it! You cannot believe the quality for this price! 
I ordered this shoes and I loved it very much!! This shoes makes me feel sexier and it match any dresses I have for the drag queen shows and for halloween that I am planning on wearing it. the heels is alittle over 5 inches and the heels are pretty very thin and it has almost all silver metal heel except very little bit on the top of the heel that match to any color with the shoe. the Amazon also put the black round thing on the bottom of the heel if it gets out then you could take it off the bottom of the heel and put another one hook back on and thank you Amazon for (2) black round thing on the bottom of the heels!! too bad it dont have gold metal heel unless you order a leopard shoe that goes with the gold metal heels but i ordered black patant and it only has silver metal heels. 5 stars for this one for sure!! 
I beat it up for six weeks in Europe. It is light, tough, and the wheels roll smoothly. 
Even it's inexpensive, the item from Amazon arrives in extra package to protect it from being bended. I appreciate the consideration 
This is just what I expected when I ordered it - nice-looking, adjustable hats that are pretty stylish. They probably go well with almost any type of clothing 
I really love this cap. Goes with any complexion well. Thanks. The shipment took a while but it was something they informed me about 
Great selection of colors, durable material and very well made. Not too shallow in the crown so the hat stays on better than some styles. This is a great value and I plan to order more of these hats! 
Very nice cap with good construction. I really liked the selection of colors that I couldn't find anywhere else. Fits perfect and great fabric 
I purchased this gown along with another for my mother, as a gift. She absolutely loved both of them! I'm so glad that I found them. I was becoming frustrated searching in the stores 
I have seen a lot of cases and this is one of the best. Protects the iPod and I can easily control the click wheel. The armband is one of the best ones out there 
The armband is the most comfortable that I have ever tried. It dosen't slip, and protects my iPod 
Fantastic shoe...it is wider in appearance than i expectet, but this did not affect the fit 
Have yet to break the product in. Looks well and delivered in a timely manner 
Fits nice, and is great for doing sports. Its also great for dancing and other socical type things where you need mobility. Looks a lot better than tighty whiteys. If you have a six pack, most girls will agree. 
I bought this for my girlfriend, thinking that it was a good find and a great deal. I was mistaken. Really, this skirt was just fabric simply stitched with no lining whatsoever. It was awful! On top of it all, it smelled too! I didn't even bother trying to return it or give it to goodwill. Instead, we just threw it away 
I bought this skirt because of the great reviews, but when I got it the smell was horrible when I opened up the package. It smells like formalin(very strong!). I already washed it 3x but the formalin-like smell is still there. The smell reminds me of preserved frogs in my Zoology class. I wonder if it was dyed right. I'm not gonna it.---S.M. NY 
My daughter saw me in this skirt and matching jacket. She almost lost her mind. I had to order it for her the same day. This is fine since we teach at different schools. It is a must have for professional educator. The Apple dresses for educator is a thing of the pass. As a teacher I am a professional and this outfit helps me to look the part Pearl RCE 
I have now bought two of these skirts and I love them. The fit is perfect for me, they are comfortable and look good. It is not the best suede, but it is affordable, with a nice look 
I ordered the Slate and the "grey" color is much bluer than grey. But it's a nice skirt, I just can't find a top to match the odd color 
This is a nice casual skirt for a reasonable price. The quality is fine. Suede is soft and nice looking. The size is accurate. Good deal for the money spent. Five stars 
This is a beautiful skirt. It's fully lined and the quality is excellent. I find that it runs true to size -- I wear a size 8 and I have room to spare with this skirt. There is also some elastic on the sides, so there is room to breathe. I think it's a great buy 
Mine's perfect! I got the Brandon Thomas grommet jacket to wear with it and it makes an adorable outfit. Very slenderizing, and I actually disagree with the other reviewer's on the sizing. I think it's pretty true to size, if not a little big. It's so pretty with the jacket, brown cashmere sweater, and suede boots. I've received so many compliments on this outfit 
great A-line look, nice quality. I ordered Ginger color, the raw color of the suede, and I bought it fron Friday Deals. It is $13.00 very well spent 
I gave this as a gift to a beach going teenager. She says that she likes it very much 
pretty top has washed well; thinner than I expected (more like a long-sleeved tee shirt). needs layered with other pieces in the Great Lakes region, unless it's early fall or late spring. decent quality 
This is a nice looking shirt and the thickness of the shirt is perfect 
I paid for two tie racks. I received a large box with only only tie rack and a receipt for both. I figured that they would send the second later, but it never happened... The one rack that I did receive looked fine 
I received this item in perfect condition. It was received in a very timely manner. 
This is my necktie. There are many like it but this one is mine. If my necktie is wrinkled, I am wrinkled. Without my necktie, I am merely smart casual. [. . .] It's amazing that I've been a male all my life (hey, this is the 21st century), worn many a necktie, but outside of those electronic tie organizers with the lights and motors they sell in Sharper Image I have never even known what sort of way one might store their neckties except in a heap--which has been my method all the while. So now that I'm a business-MAN, I wear these strange things every day, and I have many, so the heap has gotten quite a lot larger than it used to be. And now I'm doomed to neatness because I'm getting hitched--so I get to wear ties more often, but 'the pants' less. And there in the soft center of my American male mind--the wife being Japanese--I've got this idea: Why not put my neckties on a tie rack?! Brilliant!! It will be a pre-emptive strike in the neatness department--major husband points. But I don't want that dammed Sharper Image thing. It's great as a gift but to tell the truth, it takes up more than its share of closet space and wouldn't be very becoming outside of the closet. This thing though, very nice. Cedar, brass, hangs on the inside of the door. It's exactly what I was imagining, and fortunately some other brilliant man out there thought of it too. I take one point away for all the tie racks out there though, because there surely could be something just as classic and simple, but better functioning. Guess I'll have to work on that one. For instance, this could have one hinged retaining piece of wood so the ties don't all come flying off the rack when you open the closet door too fast 
The outfit is very nice; the jacket is of good quality. My new nephew is only a few weeks old, but as an experienced Mom, I knew to purchase larger size clothes. I looked for hours to find an outfit for a "future baby pilot." My brother and sister-in-law really liked it 
I bought this scarf for my daughter away at college. She wears it daily in the cold. Everyone she meets admires it. Those who are "in the know" really love it wish they had their own Harry scarf. Those who do not know Harry lore still admire the striped colors. She is the best dressed college senior on campus. The scarf is very high quality with an embroidered seal. It will last for years years. Well worth the money. 
I bought the scarf as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law. Being a Harry Potter fan, she loved it. The next time I saw her, when we went out to dinner together, she was wearing it. It looked good - not "I'm a Harry Potter Reader" goofy. 
This was a gift for my Scottish dad who loved it. Great product and really wonderful value. Couldn't find anything like it at that price 
Everyone loves this scarf. Is big enough for the winter and is pretty comfortable 
I have the brown ones. They are cuter than any shoes I ever got. They have a high heel like women's shoes. I am only seven, and I like to wear high heels. Little girls will love them! Mom says, "They are very sturdy and well-made, as can be expected from Nine West. My daughter wears them to school and runs around all day in them. She says they are comfortable. 
great price and as pictured. Its really cute but there's a seam right down the front of the cup that i didn't notice originally. Still, its a great price and a nice bra 
I found it so easy to shop threw Amazon. I found what I was looking for fast. There are so many different shoes to chose from. I love it and will always shop threw amazon, being a Canadian I thought it would take a couple of weeks to get to me. It only took a couple days. I was very surprized when my shoes arrived so fast 
I had a BAD experience with these shoes. The size runs very SMALL. Every pair of shoes I own is a size eleven, and I've ordered other size eleven's on Amazon with confidence. This pair, however, I could hardly squeeze my feet into. Trying to walk was so painful that I immediately pried my feet from the shoes. I returned the shoes, and I was disappointd by two things: 1) I had to pay shipping (almost $10) to send the shoes back. 2) My shoes cost me $30 (NOT including shipping them to me), but the company was only willing to refund $20. So, in reality, it was a huge waste of money. I paid $45-50 for the shoes, including shipping both ways, and they only refunded me $20. So I lost $25-30 on these shoes. What a waste. Can I give them zero stars 
These are adorable pumps, it's too bad I couldn't even put my foot down to walk in them. The heel is much too long 
I had to return a pair of shoes that didn't fit, but when I did, everything went smoothly and my exchange was processed quickly! Thank you so much 
These sweatpants are awesome...I purchased many in a variety of colors..Hard to find just the right pair of sweats but I think I finally found them... 
I like this product. It is good, but I much prefer the front close 
for the price, i think they are very good. and i had great, quick service. i haven't washed them yet, but i expect them to fade. i'm rather tall, so the 34" inseam is just about perfect, so i'll have to see if they shrink before i buy another pair 
Buy these! I ordered a pair to see if I would like them and now I am going to order 2 more pairs. I would order more if I had more money. Nice lightweight material, not too thick, not too thin, also very durable. I like the extra two pockets. Very comfortable. Cheers. 
Best tights I ever purchased. They stay in place and don't hike up on your leg. Great quality material used. I am very impressed with these tights 
I am a mortgage loan officer and wanted to purchase a nice leather business bag. (First impressions are vitale in this business). I can't begin to tell you how many compliments that I have received. Not to mention the packaging... It came in a REALLY nice box and an even nicer dust bag came with it. PERFECT BAG FOR THE PROFESSIONAL 
bought for my wife as a xmas gift. It is nice quality and pretty good case 
I bought this for my husband as a gift, and he loves it. It is very classy and modern. 
This is an excellent product. Would highly recommend. It looks about three times more expensive than what it costs. It comes in great packaging with a nice box and a black nylon bag over it. It also comes with a free small leather card holder. Makes a wonderful gift 
I was very pleased with this product. It was nicer then I thought it would be and it came packaged very nicely 
I bought this bag for my husband for Father's Day and he LOVED it! I normally don't buy things online because I like to touch and feel things before I buy them. And, I am especially picky about leather products. The bag is really nice and the leather is of great quality. 
I bought this bag for my wife as a Valentines Day gift. She is self-employed and uses this bag to carry everything she needs from client to client. It is large enough and has a good organizer. And she doesn't mind the clasps at all. She especially likes the ergonomically shaped shoulder strap 
This is an absolutely gorgeous bag and you will probably never find one nearly this nice in the price range. I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he uses it to carry his laptop, portfolio, books, etc to and from work, and when he is on travel. He absolutely loves the look and feel.  The bag does take two shortcuts...1) It looks like a buckle but is really a cleverly hidden metal clasp. And 2) if the clasp is not shut when you travel it clanks against the holder. You can get a bag that addresses these shortcomings by spending $200-$300 more. I didn't think it was worth it. He loves the bag as is and doesn't mind closing the clasps 
This silk scarf is a very high quality, stylish and absolutely stunning!! It goes almost with everything and you can wear it all year round. A real bargain for this price 
I brought this as a gift to my Aunt when she and my Uncle had me to stay this summer. Then, at my cousin's wedding, she was wearing it! It looked great (as everything inevitably does on her beautiful frame) 
I agree with the first reviewer. The colors are unbelievable, ocean captured in silk. Though the scarf is lightweight, the texture of the silk is not, it's high-quality silk, not the flimsy kind. The size is great, big enough to serve as a wrap or shawl, but not bulky. Worth every cent 
I received my scarf rapidly after placing my order. I like it even more up-close and will wear it as often as I can! The size is just right to allow it to work as a scarf, wrap, stole or shawl and the color is simply exquisite. 
The avaiability of the size made me choose this product. It fits perfectly and the service from the order to shipping and receiving the shoes made shopping this way a pleasure 
Awesome wallet - I like that I can remove the ID pouch when I don't want to carry everything with me. 
Great wallet, plenty of credit card slots, lightweight, the only thing missing at the moment is money to fill it with 
DKNY products are always of a highest quality. This particular product was not an exception. 
Great stuff. I brought a couple of pair to try and they'd have to be the best jocks I own. The double front mesh panels seem to be able to adjust to just the right size. These provide a comfortable amount of support and yet allow for reasonable bit movement. Highly recommended 
When men give up their tighty-whities and go for the boxer-brief, there are usually two reasons: aesthetics and support. The Under Armour Boxer Jock handles both of these perfect, while adding comfort into the mix. Aesthetics - These are definately the dream come true. The form of the boxer brief is perfect for those times when you get caught, or wanna get caught, with your pants down. Support - These are perfection in motion. Under Armour caters to the athletic gentleman, and so these are a nice combination of light fabric that really holds the boys in place. Comfort - Get the right size for you, and they won't pinch, ride up or move around. Since they're Under Armour, they're made to breathe and keep your body, at least those parts covered, at an ideal temperature. This is true even if you're working out with them on, though you ought to change when you're done! Overall, I've tried all kinds to find the perfect pair and this is really it. Comfort, support and aesthetics 
You can't beat it for the price. High quality, low price. 
I use these for snowboarding and they work ok. They usually get soaked though, but they were cheap so it's ok 
This is the third pair of these shoes that I have bought in a row and I absolutely love them. They are more comfortable than any other shoe I have worn yet still provide ample cushioning and support. They also come in widths which is a plus when comparing ASICS® to other brands. I highly recommend these shoes for runners of any skill level. 
these are the way $60 running shoes used to be made back in the 80s . . . too bad you've got to pay over $100 nowadays. Perfect comfort, but one star deducetd for the horrendous styling 
I'm 6'6", 270, and I love these shoes. After having them for two weeks, I bought 3 more pairs. Being a big guy, with bad arches, and crappy ankles, I go through shoes like crazy. When I find good ones, I stock up. These are without doubt the best shoes I've ever owned 
I'm 6'3" 210 and run around 45 miles a week in this shoe. I run on trails and pavement, and this shoe has held up well for 4 months. Light, with an easy trasition and soft upper; I've already bought two pairs and am back to re-stock (no bull). *Go to a running store before you buy on the internet, YOU WILL, MORE THAN LIKELY, NEED TO GO A SIZE OVER FOR A GOOD FIT.* Buy some socks and dip out and pay the cheaper price here 
I have had many Kayano models in the last 5 or 6 years and the latest Kayano XII is another superb shoe. Good forefoot and ankle protection, light... and a performance shoe. With other runners I often experienced shin pain. I have never had any such problems with this shoe or its predecessors. You will buy other brands, as I did, but you are also likely to return to Asics for reliability and consistency. If you've had the best why change 
Perfect little slippers to wear around the house and you can just throw them in the wash to clean them! 
They're great! Very comfortable, non-slip soles. We (my staff and I) wear them when high heels get to be too much 
I was looking for a less-expensive isotoner slipper. Made of velour, they are winter weight. At present, in Michigan, that is good. They are very nice 
This is a handy little device designed to stop pants pockets from jingling with loose change. It does what it sets out to do and does it well. This should not be purchased by people missing fingers or by complete weaklings since it takes a bit of ooomph to open it to drop the coins in. If you fall into neither category, it's a good product 
I like to carry my cash in my pocket when possible. A purse is a pain. So this is very nice for a few bills and lots of coins. It's a bit of a bear to open until you understand how. You open at the sides rather than squeeze. So it doesn't actually work the way it's designed to --- at least not well. But that's a small issue and this is a nice, well made product that should last a long time. It's easy on the pocket --- no bulge. And it's handy 
I had been looking for this exact coin pouch and was thrilled to finally find it. My husband has had one like it before and really liked it. So I bought three for the men in my family. We really like it. I hope you will find it as good as we do 
I got it for my wife and she said she is very happy with i 
Rather than throwing your change in a coffee can and eventually giving Coinstar 7%, use this well-made item. It will last for years, holds well over $5 in change and keeps coins out of the elusive nooks in your pockets 
Very good for the cold, and rainy days or snow 
I love the pattern, very disco. The material is a little stiff, but it looks good as a head scarf 
I ordered this yoga pant in black. The item I received has a very large split up the outside of each leg which is not shown in the pictures of the item and is not mentioned in the product description. The item appears so different in person that I could only assume I was sent the wrong item. The seller Athletic allows returns on merchandise but will not refund shipping charges. When I contacted the seller Athletica to say I didn't think I should have to bear the cost of shipping to me ($7.75) and then return shipping to them for their error in either shipping the wrong item or not appropriately portraying the product, they refused to do anything about the shipping costs and they tried to blame Amazon for the picture on the website rather than accepting any responsibility. I will not order from this seller again, and I would caution others against doing so either 
These shoes are so classy and comfortable. It's my first time ordering shoes online so I didn't know what to expect. I'll be buying more colors in this style. I get lots of compliments and they look nice. I LOVE THEM 
these shoes are very comfy if you're looking for an 8 hr, on your feet shoes. I'm on my feet for all 8 hrs walking back and forth and these shoes don't tire my feet. There is no strain on the arch and no pinching in the toes. Looks great with pants and skirt suits. However, they would look better with a bit of a higher heel 
I recieved this today and right out of the bag there was a small hole near the shoulder. The material looks very cheap. In addition, this is not a cardigan type sweater where you can open and close in the front. The front closure is made up of a string that loops the two side together like your shoe laces. To put it on you have to pull it on like a pullover 
This shirt arrived quickly. It is better than was described and very comfortable to wear. I appreciated the coupon to be used for the next purchase. Thanks Ann Collin 
The shirt is cool in terms of temperature on a hot day and is stellar in terms of looks. The striped, turn-up sleeves, which you can adjust are such a nice touch. The purple shade is more like a blush, but looks beautiful on anyone who likes the pink-purple shades. It's 100% cotton, strong Oxford cloth and feels "garment washed." I appreciate the speedy service I got in receiving this item from Bealls, too! Definitely give this one a try 
Item received very quickly and exactly as advertised! Excellent quality and extremely comfortable 
I hate thongs. DESPISE them. Would much rather go commando. I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g-strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you-know-where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward. (Try not to vomit.) Well, I'm one of those people who can't get a picture like that out of her mind once it, er, wedges itself in there, so I was about as anti-thong as a person could be. But sometimes you can't (or don't dare) go commando. In that case, a thong is mandatory. What to do?? A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong, and I'm thrilled to say that she didn't misguide me. The fit is loose (I know, a loose thong?--but that's the best way I can describe it) so the fabric skims the outside of your body and doesn't wedge itself in. They're the ONLY comfortable thong I've ever worn. So: comfy fit, no bacteria wicking -- you can't do better than that. 
the hanky panky 4811 is the best. hands down. this is the *only* underwear worth buying 
Very sexy and confortable panty. This is ideal for use under thight pants. Also while you are at it why don't buy your man a thong? Thongs look incredibly sexy and masculine on men. all my girfriends convinced their men to use thongs and now they love it 
These are very pretty lace, but they stay put, and really are one size fits most. I throw them in the gentle wash and low temp dry, heck with the hand washing business. These are convenient, I would buy them again 
Delivered in reasonable time, cheap protecton from scratches, looks OK. Somewhat of a pain to operate 
when I saw a case for my zen v plus that was hard, I thought it would be something that would protect the zen if dropped. I was wrong. this thing is really cheesy and flimsy. the only way I would recommend this product is if you are looking for some cute case that would make your zen more shiny, or if you want something that would protect it from scratches. that was not what I was looking for, but if it is what youre looking for, go for it. p.s. the laynard works fine, I dont know what that other review was talking about... it is ugly and really long though.. 
Pretty case, but the lanyard doesn't actually work with it. Not impressed 
Exactly what I was looking for. Very smooth feel to it, too 
These shorts are great for working in a warm climate. I have several pairs of these I like them. The cell phone pocket needs a flap because the phone can slip out when you sit down. The people at "Andrew Christian" who actually provided the shorts were really first class to work with. Exceptional 
If you have every pair of dickies ever made, this is the product for you. No one around will have these. It's an excelent way to express alittle of yourself when you already have expressing yourself down pat. They also came in a very timely manner. I was very inpressed. They look way better in person 
Excellent Product. Great Dickies quality and I love that I can customize the item with a screen print that I can choose. Love the cell phone pocket too 
How much can u talk about G-Strings?! LOL. I guess the title pretty much says it all. They are very comfortable, my lady likes the look, and they are priced right 
Sure i have bad posture from years of lugging this on one shoulder but it is so handy. The interior zipper pocket holds my credit cards, money and driver's license. The exterior pockets hold my cell phone and business cards. It can be washed and goes with everything. In a pinch it can serve as an overnight bag. The magnets are strong so the only complaints I have is that the interior pouch fabric is weak if you put a lot of change in it so you have to mend it when it springs a leak and the tie strap doesn't cinch up after a while. Hey who cares its my Prada. If they ever quit making them I will just die. 
I am very pleased with the purse.Color just as pictured, size,excellent.Service and Delivery Excellent. Only complaint, can't get that awful smell off purse from Shipping material 
My husband got me these for christmas, and they are great. It's cold up here and I can wear these outside on the snow for a few minutes and my feet stay warm. The bottoms are tough and I can tell that they will last at least two or three seasons 
Those are adjectives my son used when I asked him to describe these slippers. I had bought my husband the men's version for Christmas, but he had not been able to wear them because my son wouldn't take them off. I could not find any to fit my son, so I bought him a small size in the women's and he loves them. He puts them on as soon as he comes home, sleeps in them, and only takes them off to put on his shoes for school in the morning. We highly recommend these slippers! 
I purchased these slippers on sale which was great! I bought them a size smaller because that's all they had available but they stretched out perfectly. Highly recommended 
The International Women's Genuine Shearling Slipper is well made and comfortable to wear. It's rubber sole makes it a secure slipper on wet floors 
These slippers are just what I needed- something to keep my cold feet warm and cozy. My only criticism is that the toe is pointy, so I had to get used to my toes being a little squished. And definately buy 1 size up. I'm a size 8 and the 9 fits well 
These slippers are wonderful. They are nicely constructed, true to size and very comfortable. The sole creates a very sturdy base and gives some support. These are a wonderful winter treat for keeping warm 
These slippers were a Christmas present for a friend. She had requested them through my son. She loved them and I thought they looked really cozy 
These are nicely made warm slippers, but if you want to order them, be aware that they are smaller than other shoes of the same size number. My wife wears size 9 shoes. I originally bought these in size 10, thinking they should fit loosely, but even those were too tight. I had to return them, and get size 11 
In my experiences, Leg Avenue has always met my expections. This time was no different. The item shipped fast, was packaged effectively, and is exactly like pictured. This item is body-hugging nylon and is great for club night when you want to show a little skin. Fishnet and knee high "dom" boots look great with it 
This hoodie paired with the matching pants is such a bargain! Together, the whole outfit is $26! Where else can you find such a buy? This hoodie is very well made-just to be expected from Soffe. Very comfortable! But, you do need to know that the jacket is a short cropped length. It does not meet at the waist of the pants. Very cute and stylish 
Perfect for a newborn in winter. These rompers are well constructed, inexpensive, and not too thick to prevent layering under other clothes should the need arise. The Orange and Yellow ones are especially cheerful. I should note that the legs became too short for my son long before the rest of the romper ceased to fit, so if you have a long-legged baby perhaps try a size up 
I tried this on in the store but they didn't have it in nude. Great bra, especially for a bigger chest 
An incredible thong for the confident man. Extremely sexy, showing off your rear while hiding the essentials back there. Also to the front fits around your package in an incredible way creating almost a seperate pouch for each of the male genitals making an extremely natural fit and feel... except that the curvature will lift and extend your package quite a bit to create a significant effect under clothes and definitely when visable (although the sheerness will negate some of effect). It is quite sheer, extremely so when wet (near nude beach style), so be prepared to be showing off your stuff to that special someone or that nudish beach 
I own a few thongs and this is the best one I've purchased- the silk is so light you hardly know you're wearing it and I think looks damn sexy whilst giving you support 
The first time I used this one was almost as fast as I recieved it to try it on, it felt weird at first and I thought I wasn't going to be able to use it as underwear, it was the best of all the thongs I have(not that many). I wore it for college and it felt wonderfull, almost like going commando, but at the same time offering some protection, if I didn't have a roommate I would wear nothing but these when I am in the appartment. Strongly recommended 
This thong is the best thing I have ever worn. The soft and expandable material just hugs your body and the front pouch is really well designed and holds your "things" really well.... I mean unlike traditional briefs, these thongs have more room for them. I am thinking of ordering more of these babies for daily wear 
I've never worn thong underwear before I purchased this on a whim. But it is the most comfortable underwear I've ever worn. I'm ordering many many more. Thanks 
I've always wanted something red and sexy. These underwear are exactly what I was looking for. I was slightly hesitant to buy silk underwear at first, but this thong is quite comfortable. The thin sides and the pouch design allow for plenty of movement. Some may find the cut in the front to be somewhat low, but I like it 
I searched all over town for Crocs for my little man (size 4 1/2) with no luck. The smallest size they come is size 6-7 (obviously way too big) except for the Disney style. They are a little more expensive, but worth it. They are so easy to put on take off, and they look so cute on him. I was worried that the color might be too bright, but they're not they look great with most of his outfits! People stop us all the time to ask where we got them...I have yet to see them in a store, but I will be buying another pair in red black from Amazon 
These are the most adorable little shoes. My youngest granddaughter wanted Crocs like her big sister. I ordered these and she even wants to sleep in them. They are adorable. 
How can you not like these. Comfortable, durable and a great bargain 
I wear these virtually every day at the gym. A great athletic sock. I own about 2 dozen pairs. Why run out? Very consistent manufacturing: no worries matching socks if all your white ones are the same exact design. 
I ordered the jacket XL Tall. Surprisingly, it was too tall. I had to return and order just an XL during the height of the holiday shipping season. I received the XL jacket just fine and it fit properly. I used the online chat they have setup and it worked well. I also called on the phone and got through to live people easily 
Having enjoyed Isotoner slippers for many years, I was sorely disappointed when they changed their sizing/fit several years ago. The package sizing remained the same, however, they decided to "scrimp" on the fabric. Consequently, newly purchased slippers, though well within my known size range, (supposedly through a 10 1/2) still ran short in the toe (I wear a 10), thus far less comfortable. Was I sure...you bet. I still have an ancient pair that when I slip on, are an excellent fit. No stores carried sizes beyond XL...until I saw these on Amazon. I ordered them in XXL and they really do fit. Re-ordered 2 more pair for each of my daughters (who've had the same problem). I have to give 4 stars as I've found their overall quality is not quite what it used to be...but at least they fit 
I was skeptical about whether these slippers would be as attractive as they looked in the picture or as durable as the reviews said. They're both! Totally gorgeous satiny comfortable slippers which will hold together fabulously. Thanks Amazon 
Arrived on time and my wife is very happy with them. Thank 
I love these slippers. Their perfect fit and feel make them the first thing I slip into when I come home from work and first thing I put on in the morning. The elastic is not too tight and doesn't bind. The terry insoles cushion and comfort my feet. The shiny beige makes them look like real ballerina shoes, which adds a whimsical touch. I love the leather sole that allows me to go outside without concern. I've worn them while sitting outside with my Saturday morning coffee, weather permitting. Isontoner quality will allow me to wear these for at least 15 years. Proof? I still have my first Isotoner slippers which I received as a gift 20 years ago. If you see a pair for sale, I say go for it 
I've been wearing these slippers for years and they've become increasingly hard to find in stores so I'm grateful to Amazon for finding them for me 
They used to advertise these as being like a massage for your feet. This is true. They feel WONDERFUL. It's great when a product lives up to the advertisement 
The order was delivered in a timely manner, well packaged and as described. Thanks 
Just a note to say the this t-shirt has some good things going for it. It is the size that it says it is. Medium is really a Medium is NOT really a Large. The printing held up well in the wash and the fabric isn't chintzy so there's no see-through going on. I would reccommend this shirt 
The product came stuffed into the smallest possible package, which I guess was to keep the shipping down, though the shipping costs were higher than I thought. I do wonder if retailers are making money off over-inflated shipping. The t-shirts themselves were much smaller than the advertised youth 16-18 size. They worked and I got them for a reasonable price, so I'm happy 
This was the first time that I had ordered anything from Amazon, and I am very impressed. I'm happy with the quality of the product along with the process of receiving my order. I was sent e-mails letting me know when I would receive my order along with a web site I could go to track the item 
My whole family loves the movie Napolean Dynamite, and I bought this for my 10-yr old daughter as a sleep shirt. It's well made, and it looks just like the shirt seen in the film. She loves it 
I ordered the dress and it came very quickly. It was here in less than a week. It looked exactly like the picture and came with all the accessories it was suppose to. I'm having mine altered because it's an inch too big up top. The dress is easy to alter. It's also very easy to either attach the spagetti straps or use the scarf and make straps to attach to the dress. That is if you're uncomfortable with a strapless dress. There are so many different things you can do with this dress it's great. It's a great dress for a great price 
My daughter ordered this dress for her school winter formal. The dress was here with in a couple of days and it was beautiful. She loved the dress and looked beautiful wearing it. I would buy from this company in a heartbeat. The price was right and it was delivered fast. 
I had a last minute call to be in a wedding. The dress arrived and was very pretty and matched the description completely. The service from the company was also great 
These feel great and look great, if that's all you're wearing. If you wear you pants so high that you can't see them, then you really don't need them. If you like really low pants, then you can still flash an inch or so of underwear before your pants really are too low. The best part is that, when your pants have slipped too low, you can pull them back up without the underwear bunching up. 
Like all 2(x)ist underwear I own, this brief is made of superior materials and appears to be built to last. It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. If you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. For those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. Clearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. I found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. Practical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of "expansion room". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. If you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page 
I ordered the 2(x)ist No-Sho briefs because I wear low-rise jeans. They're really comfortable and the companies that I ordered them from shipped them immediately. Great great service 
These are very nice engineer boots! They have that tough guy look to them not to be mistaken for cowboy boots etc while standing and pants hang over them a little. Quality rubber and leather. Love mine! Chri 
These pants are great! Light weight fabric so you don't get too hot! 
These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo, it's like walking on concrete. There is no arch support. I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue 
This bra is so comfortable and gives my chest area a nice lift while minimizing, by pulling the side area towards the center. Very similar in comfort to the simply perfect bra with more shaping. Looks nice because of the lace 
Can't go wrong with Russell for sweat pants - soft and comfy and wash beautifully and keep getting better with age 
I bought these for my husband and they were a great price and he's loved the shoes! Rockports are always great 
A very good pair of shoes. Nice fit and an excellant price 
I noticed the price has gone up since I purchased them for $35. I thought it was a great deal and I am extremely satisfied. No problems with the size. I ordered a 9 and they fit like a 9 
The shoes did not fit and i was unable to exchange for a larger size. Does it make sense to be in the clothing business and not be able to exchange for another size.I would never order another clothing item thru you folks as a resul 
My daughter bought these shoes for her boyfriend and they arrived looking great. He has seemed very pleased with them 
I was impressed with the shoes when they arrived and became even more impressed once I wore them for a day. One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever had 
The size is perfect and of great quality compared to the ones I got in JC Penny for $60 to $70. This is $30 but of much better quality. 
I thought I was getting a bargain - Rockports at a discount! When they arrived, the craftsmanship and finish impressed me. Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear. They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they creased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap. Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the uppers separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases. Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath. I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear. And, I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised. I'm glad I didn't pay full price! 
These are nice shiny shoes, that break in fairly well and look adequately dressy 
Unfortunately, my experience with this product is less than stellar. For one, I am a very hairy man. A VERY HAIRY MAN. The look was completely different from the picture. Secondly, upon closer inspection of the product pictured, it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front! That must be what they mean by super sock. Anyway, when I crammed my package in there, it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole. Lastly, watch out for the string...it gets stinky 
I bought this for my son to carry his football clothes in to and from the field it is not to big but just right !! and the price is great too !!! 
This is a great product. It is well made and just the right size for books and other items. The fabric is thicker than a the regular nylon and you can tell it is a high quality product. I really like the extra convenience of the outer pocket. It allows you to carry smaller stuff that would otherwise get lost at the bottom of the bag. 
salomon karma are water shoes are very comfortable. and are true to fit, the only problem is i ordered them too big. i figured that they would be too tight. but what i do is to make them tighter i pull the little belt in the back and then it fits just right 
I love this camisole. Very smooth, comfortable and definitely conceals the areas you wish. I do not wear a bar with this item and feel comfortable with the support I receive. Highly recommend. 
the hat is fine but size is not correct. the hat is too small and not the same size as advertised or labeled. will not buy from this supplier again and recommend against the 
Excellent "touch" fabric. Very good cut for big men 
Customer service was fantastic, product exceeded expectations, would definately shop here again. 
The size is true, the look is excellent and the price was great! Amazon is the place to find top brand shoes at amazing prices 
Arrived promptly, excellent shape and beautifully designed. An excellent product with a good pric 
Nice and comfortable underwear. very masculine et flattering. The pouch offers comfort and easy access. The seat of the brief is full and fits nicely. The garment does shrink a little after first wash but the quality is top 
I know that I wasnt thinking of Arbys fish sandwiches when my wife put this on.. 
Sexy! Thank you for listing your pron on amazon. I might buy this for my next girlfriend if she's good 
It takes a little practice with some of the tools in this kit but with most of them i got right away.For the price is amazing compared to what styles you can create!! 
I've seen the informercials for the hairigami products but didn't think they could possibly work as well as shown. I was pleasantly surprised. My hair is past my waste and fine but dense. I had no problem using most of the product in this kit the first time. I especially liked the original Hairigami and the spring rings. The other products are good, too. Some of them do take a bit of practice to get the hang of, but none of them are particularly complicated. All of the products in the kits are durable and a good value for the money. I recommend this product for anyone with long hair who wants to be able to do something with it quickly and still have it look stylish 
I bought this for my wife at Christmas. At first I thought it would not be a good fit or too much lace. It is just fine for around the house and hides just enough that you don't have to close the curtains or always wear a bathrobe over it. Nor is it so naughty that the parents will wonder what the heck is going on in the bedroom should they see it in the laundry or in the clothest 
This is one of the most sensuous and beautiful gowns I have ever worn. The soft silkiness of the fabric next to my skin is wonderful. The lace top reveals just enough to peak your partner's interest. Worn with a lacey garter belt, nylons and maribou trimmed heels, they won't be able to keep their eyes or hands off of you! Very well made and extremely comfortable. 
I ordered this in black and am extremely pleased with it. It is very well made and the material is silky. It is true the bodice was a little stiff when I first got it, but this was just sizing and washed right out. The generous silky skirt swirls gently around my legs when I walk making me feel very sexy. Will order another in another color! 
I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party, because I knew the girls would like them. I've been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot. My husband does too. They look good, turn him on, turn me on too. You can't ask for more than that in a panty, now can you 
I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine. They feel good on, look great and best of all, they're low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips. And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better, cuz these are so cute. Pretty darned enticing too, if you know what I mean 
These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too. 
They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
If you will ever just try these one time, you will be hook forever 
This product fits my Vision M:60GB very well. It's easy to work with, easy to slip the player in and out. My only complaint, so far, is that the hole in the bottom for plugging things into the Vision is positioned improperly. I have to fight with the leather to get the charger plugged in. But it isn't bothersome enough for me to care much 
I mean, it has been a stressful experience, trying to find a case to fit the 60-gig Gizmo. Finally, mission impossible has been accomplished. All is well. Tell the Lady in the Lake, Camelot has a king again! It's a sturdy leather case, with a belt clip, and holes in the right place for ear phone and charger connections. It will protect the Gizmo nicely. I mean, I could just put my gizmo in the fabric pouch and stick it in my pursie, or in my pocket to power walk, but my son (an electrician) was banging the heck out of his gizmo. Now he can cover his and protect it 
Like the previous reviewer, I tried a number of cases before I found one that would work with the 60gb Zen Vision M. This one works as advertised. My only complaint is that the clear plastic screen protector is a little scratched. Other than that, its a great product. Way better than those stupid silicone skins. I also agree with the previous reviewer in criticizing Creative for recommending products that don't work with this device. Hey creative, how about making some accesories for this product. Thanks 
Finally after going through many cases, this one is the only one I found that works for the thicker 60GB Zen. Shame on Creative for their responses to me and their recommendations of so many cases that do not fit this player. Huge Kudos to this company that have finally made my Xmas gift functional for hiking and jogging for me 
The product is good. It makes the leg look elegant. Amazing Price for a quality product 
These shoes are absolutely beautiful.They look very expensive but they are very reasonable. I wished I had ordered all four colors.My sister had ordered these shoes earlier and I fell in love with them and I had to have them for myself. Thank you for designing a beautiful shoe 
These shoes are absolutely gorgeous and extremely comfortable. I bought bronze and white, and I am back to order black and champaign. These look and feel like very expensive shoes 
C.B. Collections Alexia BRONZE 8.5 M Womens I love the shoes they are my styl 
These are lovely boots at a very good price. True to size (6M) and easy to put on with the smooth side zippers. A fairly low heel makes them comfortable for moderate walking about although I would not want to walk in cold weather for extended periods. Good quality leather and I like the style and the ankle length 
Classic looking boots - they fit great, and at such a nice price! Go ahead Amazon 
I saw these same boots at a high-priced department store the day after Thanksgiving 2006 for $129! The leather is like butter -- absolutely gorgeous, and they are SO comfortable! I love these boots! Thanks for the great price, Amazon. I joined Oprah's book club and purchased these here for less than $80 (I bought the black ones). What a great deal 
These pants are great! Light weight fabric so you don't get too hot! 
My husband has always worn this tennis shoe. It has been hard to find in black in the local stores. I am glad that I can still purchase them online. The quality is excellent 
GREAT...it's little bit heavy but a got used to it. appearance is great, and as KG says "It rock with jeans"...first two days a had had blisters but after one week it's like being in heaven 
I received my order in great time,before the Christmas holiday, was pleased with the ease of how to process the order, and the look of the product was even better than the picture. Thank you and we will do business again. Travis Evin 
This is the second pair my husband has owned. He loves them because they are so comfortable and well made. They last a LONG time. He wears them outside around the yard and the desert sand doesn't hurt them. The first pair lasted 8 years. He wears them all year round inside and outside. A great buy, you definately get your money's worth 
My fiance is an accountant. I purchased these slippers for him recently, during tax season, and he loves the relaxation and warmth they provide when he gets home from a hard day 
Comfortable and fairly warm. But there's a little too much sponginess in the sole, which makes them feel unstable at first. And your foot never quite drops in without help from your hand -- you end up crushing the low heal area. But in a few days I got used to both of these things and now wear them around the house all the time and like them a lot. The price is right, too, and they arrived very quickly. 
this was a great buy and the perfect gift for any man who lounges around. have recommended and will purchase again 
The slippers are well made and nice-looking, but they were small for their stated size will have to be exchanged 
I bought a pair for my husband and son. They both seem happy with the comfort factor and I think they are cute. I think they could use a bit more of a cushion 
Even though they were shipped to the wrong address, they quickly fixed the problem and we recieved the slippers. Thank 
I bought these slippers for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them. He said they are both durable and very comfortable 
HAVE NOT TRIED THIS BRAND OF BOOT BEFORE, BUT GLAD I DID. OH SOOO! COMFORTABLE. THANKS FOR THE QUALITY 
Awesome, comfortable boots at an extremely reasonable price 
After reading several reviews had my doubts, but well when they arrived (quickly and in one piece) I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoy them! Got great compliments and would buy them again. 
They are very comfy and I love them. Wish I could wear them year round 
I am glad I read the reviews before ordering the boots. I am satisfied with my purchase. My daughter needed the boots for a last minute trip east. A majority of the reviews recommended buying a size larger and I am glad we did! They definitely run small! Can't understand how some of the reviews said they don't! My daughter wears a women's 6 and we ordered a 7. She won't be able to wear thick socks, but they will do the job for this trip 
I got a pair of these for my wife also. She loves them, that's all I know 
I purchased 3 pair and we all love them, warm, cozy and fashionable 
I bought this "fanny pack" and was pleasantly surprised with the quality (particulary the zippers). It is a very durable bag. Would definitely hold a small lunch along with keys, cell phone and wallet. 
This fanny pack was a gift for my wife who is busy and off doing errands all day everyday. She loves it since it keeps her hands free and carries everything she needs 
You always take a chance when buying shoes off the Internet. If they don't fit you have to go to the trouble of returning them to the vendor, and I, for one, really don't want to be bothered doing that. I also hate buying shoes in a store and dealing with no customer service, crowds, and a limited shoe selection. I do research before buying shoes from the Internet and really examine the size I'm getting before the purchase. These Sauconys fit me very well. The size is true; I ordered size 8.5 wide and that's what they are. I have them on now, and they give me very good support. They are lightweight and give me the support in the ankles that I need because I stand at work all day. My ankles can really feel sore by the end of my shift without the proper shoes. Also, the toebox is tapered but there is plenty of space for my toes. The shoes provide enough room without looking clunky. I just hope I will be able to buy the exact same shoe when the time comes to replace them. Why do shoe companies insist on discontinuing a perfectly good style? This makes it so much harder to purchase shoes on the Internet 
They wear really good. I have bad feet and was looking for something comfortable to stand in all day. Thanks 
I HAD THIS KIND OF SHOE SINCE 1996.THIS IS MY FOURTH SHOE. I LOVE IT 
Shoes are fairly expensive, but incredibly comfortable and durable. I bought 2 pair of these about 3 years ago and have been wearing each pair 2-3 days/wk since then and they still are very comfortable with minimal upper or treadwear. The shoe sizes 1/2 size small - I normally wear a US 9 1/2 and got these in a size 9. I definitely plan to get another pair or 2 when these finally wear out. 
I'm usually a Clark's fan, and own several pairs, but for some reason these shoes are not as "true to fit" as Amazon claims. I could not get my size 9 feet into this 9 1/2 sized shoe. It's possible that I received a defective product, but you may want to consider this before making your size selection, or check other shoe sites for similar comments. Good Luck 
Received the shoes right on time as reported. The size is good according to my wife. She was happy to learn that they were Pu (non leather) 
These look like barbie shoes and fit great (not on me ;)).. great purchase good qualit 
Imagine. A stiletto you can really stand and walk in. I love these shoes and so does everyone else who sees them 
Rainbow sandals are the best flip-flop sandals that are on the market. They fit well and will outwear any other sandals by 2 to 1. The quality is very good but not quite the heavy duty rainbows that I used to buy in the late 1970's. Island Surf is a very reliable supplier who ships very quickly which I appreciated. The product and seller are highly recommended 
After 18 years, my husband finally let go of his Rainbow Flip Flops bought in 1989. Granted the past two summers of wearing them has been an act of love on his part but, they were his favorites and though slightly cracked from lying in the sun....he could still wear them. He was like a kid with a toy when he received his new pair for Christmas...and though the logo was different, the name was the same and the quality appeared to be the same, as well. When he bought his one and only orignal pair in 1989...we gasped at the price since it was higher than the drug store brands...but, they are worth every penny...no gasps needed...they last almost forever...made extremely well...comfortable, handsome leather...we're fans! 
Excellent service and FAST SHIPMENT 
These rock...outside of work, I wear these all the time... One huge tip...BUY THEM SNUG FITTING!!!! they will loosen up quick...if you buy them loose they will get way too loose fast... email me with any questions...inluvwithsara@yahoo.co 
Awesome...my fiance is in Iraq and he loves these. They really help when things get a little too warm and are snug without feeling tight 
Most comfortable underwear I ever wore. TIghty whities are uncool, and boxers are too loose, so these are the perfect compromise 
I have been wearing this shirt - the Lands' End Button Down Pinpoint - for twenty years, at least. It is the only shirt I purchase - period. My dry cleaner/laundry claims it is the best shirt they launder - from dozens of choices. There is no better white dress shirt available, from any merchant, at any price 
I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants. Although both were fine, the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price 
These pants are nice quality and nice/flowy through leg, but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted 
My husband really likes the Intimo Men's Classic Silk Pants. They are very comfortable, and the color is really nice. He wears them almost every day! The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length 
I must say I was very impressed with this item. I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship. They were very comfortable; they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price. Another hit! I don't know how these folks do it; but Intimo's prices are amazing! I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants 
I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often: 
Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large, they are a little short on him (Looks like he's waiting for a flood).I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich.Very Nice. They wash nice also. 
these pajama bottom pants are true-to-size and well constructed. they fit comfortably and wear well. being machine washable is a real benefit as well 
My son loves these jeans although they do run bigger than most 8 Husky's. The color isn't my favorite either. The first pair of jeans there aren't holes in them after wearing them a couple of times though. So that is why I say great quality 
perfect size and fits great. very comfortable. the silver color is cool choice and goes with everything 
I have purchased God Toe socks for the males in my life forever. They wear like iron and far outweigh other brands in quality. They keep thier shape nicely and wear the best. Zappos alwsys delivers SIMPLY THE BEST for us. Ohi 
Great socks, lov'em! However, I was really disappointed to discover that when shipped to me I received tiny little boxes with one pair of socks and loads of packaging! Their socks! Pop all those suckers into one shipment, one box, one plastic bag, no stuffing, enough postage and let's call it a day! 
i have never had an experience on amazon like this before! arrived so quickly that i didnt even believe it had come until i opened the package and saw that it was indeed what i ordered. amazing service!!!!!!!! 
perfect addition to any Harry Potter collection - This is for fun and occasional use, but not for the really really low temps, but that's not what we were after with this Novel Item. Thanks 
This is perfect gift for kids or any HP fan! It's not the highest quality scarf (tassels a bit ?), but the set is Authentic and Well Priced with this vendor and they deliver fast too 
We sent these to all of our nieces and nephews for Christmas and they're perfect! Fast and accurate delivery, best price too. Thank you 
This was a terrific set - especially for the Lowest Price we could find online! There are 2 mftrs who make this (we bought both!), and this one is the best! No, it's not HIGH Quality Scarf Set, but it's the NOVELTY of the Harry Potter Licensing and unless you're looking for an expensive scarf set, it's perfect. Would also recommend this merchant as they offer the Best Price, Quick Delivery and courteous communications 
The shipping on this light weight item was a little high. the quality is good, but the tassles on the end are sewn on cheaply and get matted easily. 
I bought these for my 2 1/2 year old grandson, to be prepared for the day he's ready to use the toilet. He wears 3T and they're too big for him. He wanted to wear these over his diapers. Last week I bought him some Easy Ups and he wanted to wear Spiderman over them. Now he tells his mom when he needs to go to the bathroom and he has no trouble taking them off by himself. He doesn't want Spiderman to get dirty. His mother is glad I bought them. Spiderman motivated him to train himself at least during the day. He still wakes up wet in the mornings, so Spiderman has to have nightime protection. I bought three packages so far. 
I wouldn't have expected any less from Aerosoles. Fantastic fit! So comfortable 
do they only make it in XXL and this disgusting color? other colors are shown but you can't chose the 
These boots and beautiful and very stylish! The price was just astounding; I couldn't be any happier about that. One of the boots rubbed on the ankle for the first few days and felt tighter than is comfortable. But after a few days of breaking the boots in they became easy and comfortable to wear 
After being forced to re-package our suitcases on the floor of the airport we decided that a travel scale was essential. The wife's suitcase was 55 Lb, mine was 35. The airline people weren't going to average them. This scale is the answer. It is designed to show the weight of the piece of luggage once it is lifted and sat back down. You don't have to struggle to see the weight while holding it in the air. It also has a convenient measuring tape built in to make sure you meet not only the weight but also the size requirements. It is rugged and well built 
No comment. Everything is OK ! Regards, Cristia 
A great example of perfect customer service. I ordered two scales by standard (free) shipping. In a few days, I received just one and immediately called customer service but the Department dealing with this was closed (it was 6PM on a Friday). I was told someone would contact me Monday. To my surprise, a lady did call me and not only did she dispatched the scale same day by next day air but she also refunded a part of the total cost (an honest admittance of error and the courage to say sorry!). The products are excellent and I would never ever think twice before dealing with this seller 
When a limited weight is required by airlines, this scale really helps. Airlines can charge for over-weight luggage. I wanted to be sure I wasn't over the limit 
First, this shoe runs small, a full size at that. Most importantly the only thing that could make this shoe wearable without mind numbing, jaw clenching, tear jerking pain is a local anesthetic. Steve Madden must Hate Women, this is the third Madden shoe I've bought that was painful beyond description. I thought maybe the first time it was simply that particular shoe and it's design, but the 2nd and 3rd were progressively more painful than the first. Every person involved in producing Steve Madden shoes should be sentenced to wearing them for a full year. 
I choose 3-6 months size, but it looks like a 9 months size 
This is a cool little onesie. It was only $3 so I bought it cause I thought my husband would like it. He did. It fit good and I have no complaints 
My husband loves this shirt! Also, it is pretty soft and seems to be comfortable 
These shoes are comfortable, stable and pretty. They sort of have a spanish dancer look to them with the way the heel is wider at the top. I got a lot of compliments on them. Piperlime said they ran large so I ordered a half size larger and they fit well. 
My order arrived sooner than expected. Beauty and comfort that's all I can say about this shoes 
This shoe is so much better than the picture shown. The red is just perfect. The picture does not do it justice....and you just cant beat the price. 
I ordered these in red and must say that they are great shoes that can be worn with jeans or a skirt to work or for a casual get-together. I ordered my normal size and they fit perfect. For less than $25, these shoes were a great deal 
I ordered these in my regular size (7 1/2) and had to return them to go down a half size. They are adorable and comfortable--just be aware that they run a little large 
Lots of people have issues with Dov Charney's (American Apparel's CEO) management style. Fine. Whatever you think of unions, sexuality in the workplace, and skanky porn-star allure, it's still a good basic t-shirt that's flattering on the female figure. The 4305 baby rib works well with both jeans for a casual look or slacks/skirt for the office professional. I own two, kelly green and black, and thanks to the soft, comfortable cotton and stylishly tailored sleeves they're regular players in my daily wardrobe 
This is a great lingerie cage! It washes all my bras without ruining them in the washer. Yay! Saves time for me so I am very happy with this product 
What a great product. These overalls are comfortable and warm for the winter without having to wear layer upon layer. Wonderful 
I bought several pairs of these about 3 months ago. The price sounded reasonable, and was the best that I had been able to find online, so far. After I finally received them, I wish that I had never even bothered to make the purchase in the first place. They were slower than a snail to ship them, and when I opened them, I could see just by looking, they were mismarked, and way smaller than they should be. So now I am out over $100, for merchandise that is worthless to me. I tried to contact the seller, they have never responded. Don't even waste your time here. YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!! 
Now if you ask me, and plenty of folk do who are in need of both durability and comfort in a workable, fashionable statement in their wardrobe... these here overhauls are the way to go. Not only are they practical work clothes - they clean up nice and can be worn out on the town when need arises. Plus that, this particular make comes in triple X Large and that, my friends, is almost big enough for Mama to slide in to a pair here real soon., See she's been on the Atkins Diet for a few months and she already dropped about 86 pounds but she's got a couple hundred to go before she's back down to her old fighting weight and can get in to these uni-sex universal timeless classic overhauls. Possum Belly overhauls are the best, but you can't really find them on the internet unless you get real lucky and are willing to buy imports... which I ain't. 
I am a large busted woman and it is very difficult to find a bra that fits. I purchased 2 of these Vanity Fair Secret Luxury bras and I must say they are very comfortable to wear. They are very well made. I always try to find a 4 hook bra and this bra has 4. I went to lunch with a couple of my friends the other day and even told them about my find. I even showed them how well my bra fit. 
I absolutely love these shoes. I love them so much I bought a black pair too. They are very comfortable. I get compliments on them daily. 
These shoes are super comfortable. I can wear them all day and my feet do not hurt. Well worth the money 
Very comfortable and well made. I bought brewski first and liked them so well I ordered another pair in black a few days later 
As usual, the WebUndies are unbelievably soft. The best sleepwear I have found to date. Amazing... 
When I got these, I was immediately impressed with how great they look! They are very comfortable and definitely worth the price too. They offer a lot of support and are probably the best flip-flops I've ever purchased. The only thing is they run a little small in size. 
I love these sandals!! They are so comfortable. No rubbing or iritation, even the first time I wore them! I usually buy the cheap flip flops, but these were definitely worth the money! 
These sandals are my all time favorites. I've been wearing them for year and years. Glad this style is still around after all these years 
Reef's are the most comfortable pair of flip-flops I have ever owned! I would wear them every day if I could. I never would have imagined that flip-flops could be designed for comfort, but these are the best. The have arch support, nice cushoining and have never given me blisters like the plastic slip-flops I've owned. You won't regret getting these. 
I picked up a pair of Reef Sandy's at the beach years ago still love them. The tread has finally worn down on them, so this year I got two new pairs (brown pink, both are gorgeous). They mold to your feet quickly, and the wide fabric strap is so comfortable, unlike cheap flip flops. Never had a problem with any ripping or breaking. One important thing to note--these run about a size small. In other shoes I wear a 7 or 7 1/2, but a size 8 Reef Sandy fits me perfectly 
I grew up in Hawaii wearing these shoes and fifteen years later they are still an integral part of my wardrobe. I LOVE Sandies for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that they're an incredibly good deal. For $22, I get shoes that last an average of two years. They come in so many colors and each year, another one or two is added to the line. I wore these touring around Europe and Japan earlier this year--walking around all day, every day for over a week in each place--because they're much more comfortable than my Nikes etc., that cost five times as much. They go great with everything, and don't try to tell me different! A great investment at $22 
These jeans became an instant favorite with my 11 year old daughter. They look great and she says they are very comfortable. She wears them often and they are holding up well under frequent washings 
Aside from being the default foot wear for anyone who has to clear security to fly, I wear mine to the gym both to lift weights and jog the treadmill. It's gotten some questions and raised some eyebrows. My answer is that no running shoe I have used gives the same comfort. nb around boats where you feet will go wet, I prefer the beach model which is offered in fewer sizes, they try to cover two shoe sizes for each croc. I wear both types ALL of the time and wear has been less than with the common loafer 
I love these clogs. They are very comfortable.(but be careful of the sizing, you may need one size smaller than usual) They can be rinsed off very easily to be kept clean. They have no holes so my feet can get a little moist. They are easy to slip on and off and don't absorb foot odors 
These are probably the most comfortable pair of shoes/clogs/sandals I have ever worn. I love that they weigh next to nothing and have a pretty generous fit in the forefoot and toes. Props to Crocs for a well-made clog 
These Hipsters are what I expected: soft, no marks at all. Very comfortable 
These socks wear well with a kilt, keeping the legs warm in snowy conditions 
It's a very nice top. I had a great surprise.. 
Bellissimo! Buttery soft and fit like...a glove!!! Very nice quality. An exceptional buy. Loved the free shipping. 
My son thinks that this is the best jersey ever! He never wants to take it off. I'm really impressed with the quality of the product. I'm sure that he will enjoy this for years to come 
My girl is very happy of your product. Thank you for giving us excelent products. Regard 
The look great- are comfortable and the heel isn't too high for me- very styling! 
They do seem to run about a half size big. Also, they seem a bit narrow in the toe area. Otherwise, they are cute and comfy once you break them in 
Nice boots. I think the brown boots I purchased look better than the black boots in the picture. It's a casual boot that really looks good with my jeans 
I was very disappointed with this rain suit. I bought it, especially after seeing the above review, since I too bicycle to commute. I'm not sure if they sent me a different rain suit or what, but the one I got didn't have the overall pants. I bike an hour each way and, after the first ride, the pants have holes around the bicycle seat area and the material is breaking down at other points in the pants as well. The jacket immediately started coming away from the bottom snap. (Definitely not a "rugged" suit!) I didn't have a problem with being too hot, although perhaps that is because this is springtime in New England. I wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute is quite short. 
This is not wussy, pansy-type raingear. This will keep you actually dry. I have been using it to commute on my bike in heavy rain and it succeeds where feeble "breathable" raingear fails. If you are exerting yourself this will probably be a bit hot, but if you are not working up a sweat you will be just be warm and dry. And it's a great value, it looks like it will hold up for awhile and it's way cheaper than the breathable stuff 
I was more than pleased with this this little hat I bought for protecting my baby from the tropical sun where we live. It not only completely protects her face, but the back of her neck as well. The elastic back allows her to wear it now and it will still fit her in a couple of years. Great hat 
The seller shipped my purchase quickly. Carters is my favorite brand for baby clothes. Durable, 100% cotton and cute. I gave these as a gift in a baby shower and the new mother loved them 
This item came on time but the sizing are wrong.I normally wear medium and I bought large thinking the cheap price would affect sizing. I was right. Had to give them away,could not wear them.They were so tight and the fabric so light I could not think of wearing the 
I ordered these short for my husband and he loves them. The fabric is soft and comfortable and the colors are great too. The shorts fall right at the top of the knee and they fit great. Good buy for look and price 
I ordered a pair of these shorts in every color. My husband loves them! Well worth the price!!! 
I love Birkenstock and at this price, I just couldn't let it pass! They are so comfortable. I'm wearing them right now! 
I am satisfied with the purchase and price was unbeliavable. Thinking of ordering another pair. 
this is the best clog I've ever worn. very comfortable, fit true to size, also very chic and the most important one is the sale price :) catch it before it's gone 
The only words that I can say are wonderful! The savings were great. I own several pairs of birkenstocks and they're not cheap, however they are quality shoes that last. You get what you pay for. Being a health acre provider these are the only shoes that I have found that last. Knowing that it prompted me to start wearing them for everyday wear also 
This was a fabulous purchase, great product and the price was the best I could possibly have found after hours of research. Thanks so much 
I have had 1 pair of Birkenstocks before that required a bit of "foot shaping break-in time". These were comfortable from the first time they were put on and remain comfortable all day long. They were well worth the money 
These are the only shoes I wear so I bough tthem for my daughter. They are so comfortabl 
Thanks for selling such a great product...ON SALE!! The shipping was super!!! The fit and comfort are wonderful! The foot bed is similar to the Arizona sandals, which is softer than most Birks 
These shoes are extremely comfortable. I could wear them all day right away. I'm extremely pleased with them. I found them to be plenty roomy, so I wouldn't recommend over-estimating your size or width 
These shoes are great. They are comfortable and stylish on. You need to wear them like any shoe to break them in, then they feel like a tennishoe. Wish they had more colors, I'd buy them all 
I bought these in black and I am absolutely enamored with them. They feel oh-so-comfortable and are much more attractive in person. Great pair of sensible shoes. 
I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it. It is soooo comfortable!! Why do girls always get the soft and comfortable night wear, and us boys get stuck with flannel??!! HA!! Thanks... 
This inexpensive windbreaker is attractive and does the job. My only minor issue was that there was a little too much fabric around the zipper so care must be taken in zipping and unzipping 
Let me tell you, i purchase alot of underwear and these right now are one of my favorites. They are so comfortable and i love the material. I will be purchasing more in the future for sure 
These shoes are super cool and pretty comfortable considering their height. I get compliments on them whenever I wear them. I will say that I thought they were going to be a little lighter in color, but I actually like that they are more khaki than natural/bone. I have other Naughty Monkey shoes, too. I'm recently obsessed.. 
I bought three pairs of these acorn slippers for Christmas presents. My husband and two grown sons love them. They all say these are some of the most comfortable slippers they have ever worn. 
OK, these Acorn slippers won't win any beauty contests, but they are extremely comfortable and durable. I work out of my home and contentedly shuffle about in them each day for hours on end. 
The sole is high-profile and well-cushioned. However, the top material is a soft and flimsy towel-like material that does not provide any lateral support for the foot. With any walking pressure to the side (as in turning a corner!) the foot is allowed to slide and "fall off" of the sole in a sprain-your-ankle sort of way. I felt very at-risk when I walked in them 
I think they are a little pricy, but will to pay for a good product. fit well, very comfortable, but the sidewall of the shoe could be strong so you could slip them on without bending overto get your heal in, but overall a good product 
There are four sound reasons for considering these Acorn Textured Moc Slippers: 1) They are reasonably priced. 2) They are among the most comfortable slippers I've ever worn. 3) These slippers have a lot of "give" to the material, so they'll accommodate a variety of foot widths. 4) The basic checkered design is casually stylish. Above all, I doubt that you'll find a more comfortable slipper for the price. 
There is no reason to buy over-priced, fancy-schmansy slippers when you're sitting in your favorite recliner, watching your favorite television show! These are the perfect slippers to complement your comfort. They keep your feet warm and provide a soft, cushion sole for those moments when you have to get up and refill your drink or get more snacks from the fridge. I love my Acorn Men's Textured Moc Slipper with blue checkers, and you will too. I promise, you won't be disappointed. But be careful, they are just the right size for your dog to sink his teeth into 
I made pockets and sewed them on and I embroidered designs on the pockets and on the bags. The fabric is easy to work with and the bags are great for reusable shopping bags or taking stuff to the gym or the beach. I'd buy them again. The shipping was kind of high and I was charged for each bag, even though they all came from the same manufacturer 
I purchased several of these types of tote bags from Bagedge. They're strong enough for every day for light weight items. Of course the bags look bigger in the picture than in person. 
They looked sharp when I first wore them. After wearing these 5-6 times, they're wearing out. This is the first pair of pants that has developed obvious wear (and a hole) where my wallet sits. They look and feel like something you'd buy at Wally World. The only description is saw in the original description was "Cotton and Microfiber". Now I'm glad to see that they've added the word "POLYESTER". They seem to be made of perhaps 90% polyester and 10% cotton. I've always had good luck with other merchandise from Jos Bank. Maybe next time I'll try a more expensive pair of slacks. 
Very good material in construction of these pants. Good fit, good looks, good price 
I love these boots so much I bought them in every color and leather type available! They are very comfortable yet stylish enough to wear with dresses and skirts. I hate pointed toe shoes and was worried that these might prove too narrow, but the toe area is only gently pointed so they feel and fit fine. Also, I have a fairly wide foot and typically wear clogs with socks, but these again worked well for me. The leather is soft and I assume will give a little over time which just means a slightly thicker sock from my huge stash. Also, there is minimal padding so a sock helps with cushioning. Sometimes I unfold the flap to make the boots a bit taller. I only wish they had a version that truly came to just below the knee. I'd buy that in every color, too 
I love these boots. They are comfortable and perfect for Chicago winters 
These boots are very comfortable they look good too 
My shoes came promptly and in good condition. I love wearing them and they looked even better then I thought they would 
For everyday wear with a little hint of fishnet but the comfort of cotton. They recommend 4-10, 4-8 is probably best. I have both the black and the white and can't believe the price 
Keep warm dry in wet weather with these unique boots that everyone will notice 
i cannot wear these boots in public for more than five minutes without compliments flying my way. many people think they are hand-painted. i bought them because i harassed a woman on the subway about where she got hers. i was obsessed; i searched everywhere before finding them on amazon. they are very comfortable, roomy and i will have them forever; rain boots never go out of style. enjoy 
I bought this dress and my wife loves it. The dress looks very stylish and can be accesorized so it can be "dressed up" or "down." On a cooler day, you may want to wear a turtleck and hosiery with it. It is kind of short, so wearers should keep that it mind. Overall, it is a nice-looking, good-value dress 
I love my new CalPak messenger briefcase. I have been carrying it for three weeks now and it is wonderful. Lots of space to carry things, convenient with holes for pens and little pockets for all your other necessities. It could use an area for bottle water but other then that I highly recommend it 
Perfect bag for our needs. Made very well and will last a long time. Nice bag for an excellent price!! 
It's a great everyday bag, well-constructed and durable. It's not made for laptops, but it never claimed to be. I can stuff plenty of items within the bag without any worry that it will split at the seams 
You'd be surprised about how much this bag holds! The only problem is that it's big enough fora laptop, but doesn't offer any protection for it. It's also hard to move through crowds with it sometimes 
I love the bag but it s bigger than what I had anticipated. Still, it is durable and waterproof. I got caught in a snowstorm and nothing inside got wet. 
Comfortable and seamless. All around good product especially if you need a good lift 
these are wonderful shorts. great compression and fit. they look and fit the same wash after wash and are so comfortable that I will probably order more pairs 
The Bloch leotard is by far my favorite of my collection of different brand and style leotards. It is soft and stretchy and breathable. This leotard and any of Bloch's cotton-blend leotards are favorable (and more forgiving) to larger-chested girls. It is the only leotard I've found yet that doesn't push one's endowments down toward the ground but instead keeps them close to the ribs. It was a good purchase, and I'm glad I have it 
I purchased this toiletry case for my son's year abroad. He needed something larger than the usual kit and this was perfect - it is large enough for shaving cream and lots of other needed items, is washable and folds flat when not in use 
I just returned from two weeks of birding in Brazil. We hiked for miles each day and the Tilley's Travel Socks were very comfortable in the hot tropical locations as well as in the cooler mountain regions. I took three pair with me as well as some regular socks, just in case I did not like the new Tilley's Travel Socks. From now on, I can save on packing space and weight by just taking the Tilley's Travel Socks 
I took the socks to Paris for a recent trip. I was pleased with the comfort of the socks as well as the ability to dry relatively quickly. 
This was purchased as a gift for one of our grandson's - he was very happy with it. Priced right 
I just received 2 and am going for more. Love the fit (much truer to size as jcrew)and personally do not mind the shorter rise 
About the "red flag: reviewer: This person ordered a children's sized sweater. I ordered this same sweater, properly, for my 8-year-old daughter, and it fits accordingly. Liz Claibourne makes a great product for the price - they are pretty much true to size. It is VERY IMPORTANT to pay attention to whether you are ordering children's clothing or adult clothing. Give me a break! It's no wonder it didn't fit 
I found the european back (basically a y-shape) to take some getting used to, but all in all, this is a decent thong. The 100% cotton is quite comfortable. This and the adequate waist band makes for decent comfort and moveability 
The 2(x)ist has reasonable support and comfort but most thongs do, so that's nothing special. What's not reasonable is its appearance. With its non-colors (black, white, gray) and jock-like look, this is one seriously dull undie. Considering one of the major perks of wearing a thong (compared with lesser styles) is how good it makes you look, this shortcoming is inexcusable. Even my girlfriend concedes that, although better looking than boxers or briefs (neither of which I wear), these are clearly below par for the style. There are plenty of alternatives that are more elegant and stylish. On Amazon alone there's the: Contour Pocket Thong, Extreme Thong, Glossy Thong, Microfiber Contour Thong, Microfiber Low-rise Thong, Skinz Thong and String Thong. Amazon even sells some excellent full backs: Contour Italian Cutaway Bikini, Microfiber Clip Bikini, Silk Extreme Brief and String Tricot Brief. Thongs are clearly the best style but there's nothing wrong with having a bit of variety in your underwear drawer. So in summary: Feel - C, Look - F, Overall - D 
I love this product. Just like the T4 which were discontinued. Good response when running 
This item makes you feel sexy, even if you are shy and/or not feel so confortable with your body. It make you feel dress and undress at the same time. I love it because I dont need to take it off at all, avoiding the sensation of been naked. With this you can enjoy been with your partner having amazing s..x. 
If you really follow the direction how to wash it then should not be a question. I promptly remove it from the dryer or hang dry. It dries out very fast and does the job it promises. "those who can't dance should not dance at all 
Okay, I admit it, I bought this shirt because I thought it was sexy and it is. But the labeling peels off after only one wash. Who is going to hand-wash a workout shirt? Looks good if you are extremely buffed 
Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal 
These are a very pretty pair of shoes and also comfortable. They go with practically anything. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because i did find them a little bit narrow 
This shoe is so cute. I love the shoe and the style, but the shoes run a little small, so I would recommend that you get a size or half size larger just in case. 
These are really great shoes. They look absolutely adorable with A-line type skirts and dresses, especially if you are going for the vintage look. Also very cute with capris. I would suggest tying them while standing and also keeping the ties closer to your ankle. I originally tied them up while sitting and when I stood up, it slipped down to my ankle anyway. 
Really nice shoe but if your feet is a little wider at the front then you should think about getting a larger size. I normally wear a 6.5M but I had to get a 7.5M because it's a little too narrow at the front. I could wear the 6.5 but it would have been really uncomfortable tight 
Great shoes , although some people wrote that they got a slightly bigger size then usueal , i found it to be unnecessary , use your regular size when ordering. the shoes are relatively comfortable as far as high heels go ( I usually wear flats and I have no trouble walking in these at all ). The color is exactly as picture describes . A great addition to any summer wardrobe 
I'm very happy with these pair that I bought. I got the dark brown sandals to pair with my skirts, jeans and capris and it really compliments my outfit!!! I love it, very comfortable and not too high...So, go ahead, don't think twice, get yourself one now!!! You won't be sorry!Promise 
These Tommy espadrilles are the cutest shoes I bought all summer. I get so many compliments on them. They go with everything. You can't go wrong with them. I am between size 6 6.5 and I ordered 6.5 and they fit perfect 
These shoes do EVERYTHING!!! They are the perfect dress shoe, but just casual enough to wear with jeans. If you want to be classy, the ivory and dark brown are great colors. If you want to be girly, the cotton candy does that for you. Or, if you want to be funky, the blue ithiga is perfect. I love it!! 
This wrapping paper is good and it's unique, I'm glad I found it 
Dunno what I fed to my kid, but very hard to get pants in this size. He wears them, so that's great 
These tanks are very cute. Infact, I am going to be ordering more for my little guy for the summer 
I am glad I listened to the reviewer that mentioned the Ankle Pain. I thought these shoes were very cute and exactly what I needed for my trip to Florida. They are indeed very cute on -- but run a half size large so buy a half-size down. I ended up returning them because I wore them around the house, and noticed my ankles were being forced to bend inwards. The size was correct, but the shoe is built to angle inward. I didn't wear them long enough to have pain, but it definitely was getting uncomfortable. The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn't stay shut, the velcro kept releasing. I was constantly re-fastening them just the short time I wore them. The style is perfect, I hope Skechers tweaks this model to fix what is wrong. I ended up buying the Skechers Bikers Tailgater (runs true to size), which is similar but has a better velcro strap, and have suede inserts where the mesh ones are on the Sightseers (I would have preferred the mesh given I was buying them for Florida) 
I purchased this shoe at a retail store, before just now finding it on Amazon, for less (of course). Buy this shoe!! It is the most perfect shoe. It has the graceful look of a ballet slipper, the comfort of walking barefoot, and the active sole of a tennis shoe. The velcro makes it easy on and off, so it is great for the active mom. I wish I could get it in every color, but the pink is just too fun. And, it actually looks good with whatever color I'm wearing - it's just that cute of a shoe! Enjoy 
Very comfortable casual shoe. I stress casual because there is no support. Love the mesh ventilation! Keeps feet cool. Easy on and off. Toss them in the washer when needs cleaning. Every time I wear them, someone stops me and compliments my shoes and wants to know where to get them. 
I'm buying a second pair of these in a different color. They're really cute, far dressier than tennis shoes and extremely comfortable. Perfect to wear with broom skirts, slacks and jeans. They seem to run a little large so I'd suggest you go down a half size from your normal shoe size. 
Skecher's shoes have always provided a good fit for me since I am between a size 11.5 and 12 most shoes don'r really feel good on my feet. THe fit that these shoes provide is perfect for my feet. These shoes are great for work since I tend to walk around a lot during the day at a high school, and they look good 
great looking tought shoes, not quiet as good looking in the flesh as they are in photos, but good none the less 
This is nice looking,comfortable and true shoe size as mentioned. I am happy with this purchase 
My husband fell in love with these shoes but couldn't find this exact color in his size in other stores. When I finally found them on Amazon for such a great price, we snatched them up immediately. These shoes are very nice and also very comfortable. They look good with almost anything; you can dress them up or down and look fashionable. My husband is very picky with his shoes, and comfort is a must for him. If you have a hard time finding shoes that fit your style and comfort, these may be the ones for you 
When I received the product, I freaked out because it seemed really small, but I decided to try it on anyways. As it turns out, Poof makes their tops with a kind of slenderizing cotton/spandex blend that is very flattering; kind of like jersey material. The shirt is well made and I will be ordering this in a few more colors. Grab these while you can, girls. This is way better than what you will find in the mall 
I bought this one in red and it's so cute. It does run small though. I'm a size 1 and it was tight. I had to cut the edges up top. It looks so cute and my fiance thought it was very sexy. It's form fitting so if you aren't skinny, this top isn't for you. 
I bought these for walking not running. They are very comfortable and offer very good support. Good air flow for cool feet. They look nice too. The clincher was that they come in a wide size for my wide feet 
At first I thought it was dumb to review my running sneakers but I chose to share my experiance. I hope someone finds it helpful. If your new to jogging or long distance running, do not place your faith in these reviews. Everybody has a different feel. If your interested in any type of cardio that involves running, go to a foot doctor and find out, the type of feet you have. The doctor will give you a list of the type of running shoes you can wear. If your wearing the wrong shoe, your feet is going to tell you because after about a week(maybe) your going to have pains in your feet, ankles, and back. I know this, through trial and error. I have spent hundreds trying to find the "best shoe". In my opinion, the dumbest thing anyone can do is buy running shoes online. This is not like buying a movie, go to the store and try on your shoe. That way you can leave happy 
I am what most runners call a Clydesdale, tipping the scales north of 230 pounds. As a result my feet and joints take a real pounding (no pun intended). I run on tar (no concrete), wooded paths (dirt), and occaisionally a treadmill, and I have found that these shoes are ideal for me. I have mixed wearing Asics GT-2000 series shoes with various Nike, New Balance, saucony, reebok, and other stability oriented trainers for more than 20 years, and the GT-2000 series in unsurpassed in my view. While I have a tendency towards plantars fascitis, I have never experienced any bouts while wearing the Asics shoes. I also prefer the firmer feel of the Asics to some of the Nike Air shoes I have used in the past. as you can see, I am sold on these shoes. But make sure you try a pair on before you order them; I believe the reason they are so good for me is that they fit my feet well (I have a wide forefoot and narrow heels). They may not work for you. if not, I would suggest you try some new balance, as they come in various widths, and to me have a similar "feel" to these. Good luc 
Great shoe for my milage. I recently had my "step" analyzed by computer to make sure I was using the correct shoe as I prepared for a half marathon. I wanted two things: Comfort and Stability (to protect my ankles). I tried out at least 7 different shoes. The Asics GT-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of "give" it had during each step. Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands. In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles. Turns out it wasn't necessary. I'm running 5-11 miles per day, both on a tred mill and the road and in both conditions I'm pleased with the shoe. I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe. The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved. After a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!) I've been using a bulky ankle brace. Even with the brace, the shoe has been very accomodating. I've run in wet conditions a few times and they haven't gotten too soggy, but I've yet to find a shoe that feels "great" in the rain. 
I have purchased several flexees products following a tummy tuck. They wash well and are comfortable. The only problem with this product is it is pretty long. I have a long torso and this was longer. I would buy it again though as it is well made and does the job 
They fit like a glove and are extremely warm and comfortable. They were fairly quick to get here. I reccomend them highly 
Got this duffle for our son who wanted a bag that he could get everything in while travelling the country. It's perfect and had so many features that we were astounded. The quality was excellent and the drop bottom compartment accomodated his sleeping bag and sleeping pad. Very happy 
I purchased last years model of the AT202 (not as pretty, but the same functionally) and took it on my trip to Peru for 4 weeks. The bag is huge and it is well separated so you can divide your things exceptionally well. It can be wheeled, carried (with top handles) or hefted on your back. I put the bag heavily loaded on my back and carried it for about 3 blocks in Cusco. While it wasn't the most comfortable carry - it allowed me to move faster and more easily. The one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers. At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined. But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end (using small force) and the teeth seemed to be fixed. I really love this bag and will use it often for all my travels, so the potential zipper problem is the only thing I can mention. I highly recommend the bag 
Above average for Underware..can't find locally so this is the place to get it.. 
These shoes look dressy enough for business wear, but are extremely comfortable and easy to wear 
Comfortable, classic, and true to size. I am happy with this purchase 
In my last order I bought both Ravissant and Lace Nouveau panties, so have had a good chance to compare both. As a fan of retro 50's lingerie I love them both. They both have the same silky material that feels so slinky, but the Ravissant are not as sheer as the LN. Ravissants are more plain jane quotidienne undies than the L.N., however I like to dress them up by wearing lace top stockings or even better a lacey garter belt under the panties as they are still sheer enough to be revealing.One small point is the sizing. I usually wear a size small in panties and the size 5 are a generous fit more like a medium. I like snug fitting panties, but not everyone does. Same great bargain as the LN and I wouldn't hesitate to try more vanity Fair lingerie 
This is a very high quality product...well-made, looks great in town and performs well on the trail 
The retail price listed on the tag ($88) is a fantasy price. These pants are not lined, a fact more noticeable given the thinness of the fabric. But they fit well. They are not as ridiculously generously cut for the size as some of the newer Jones of New York and Lauren by Ralph Lauren stuff (size is just a number but it is supposed to convery some consistency that is completely missing from the new clothing marketing framework). These pants are well worth Amazon's selling price ($17) but not the list price 
Living in Southern California there's not much need for gloves. But a recent cruist to Alaska made it necessary to find some. Couldn't find any in the stores in San Diego in August (go figure) so I ordered these from Amazon. They did exactly what I wanted them to do ... keep my fingers warm in Glacier Bay, Alaska. I bought pairs for all the other women traveling in our group. Everyone loved them and they are tucked away safe and sound for the next trip to "cold weather country". 
I purchased this jacket at a discount store for $80. I got the sleeve caught on a sharp object and tore a hole in it. I loved that jacket and went all over (store hopping by car and foot)but couldn't find another one in my size and in black. I took a shot at looking for it online - Wow - there it was on Amazon for $25. The exact jacket. I love it. The shipping was so fast. The jacket is great quality and fits well. I get so many compitments on it - even from my 18 year old daughter 
I ordered the black first and then the wheat. This identical jacket is over $100 at my local mall. I ordered a small and it fits perfect. You could dress this jacket up or down especially the black one. It is well constructed - looks expensive and is a medium weight but not at all bulky. A very classy jacket. I am very happy with my purchase. 
I live in California and bought this jacket for a trip to the midwest in the middle of the last big snow storm. I really don't know what I would have done without this jacket! It's not big or bulky at all and it kept me warm and dry. I really love it, very cute 
I don't like the fact that the side clips are not adjustable. Overal the jacket is wonderful, great to the touch and warm enough for NH weather - most of the time 
Looks good with jeans, looks great with dress pants. This is a great wardrobe piece. Lots of style. 
These have a nice fit. They are low cut and fairly flattering. I got the red ones and I would say they're of good quality. However, if you're in a hurry, good luck. It took awhile for them "notify the carrier for pickup". Then it was another couple of days before they actually got out. They got to me shortly after that 
This is my second pair of Tsubo boots and I love them. I completely loved my first pair , but unfortunately left them in a hotel room in Atlanta. I was devastated when I realized what I did. I recommend these boots to all 
We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season. Unfortunately, the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails. We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching. We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company, but we can not get anyone to respond. We will never order anything through Amazon again 
This is a nice gazebo. It's not the cheap $50 job that breaks the first time you try to use it. Consists of three pieces: 1) the frame that folds out like a huge accordian deal, 2) the nylon (like tent fabric) top that fits snugly on with velcro straps, 3) the case. Takes maybe five minutes to set up, if you're slow. Has three height settings, and you can stake it into the ground too, if you are on grass. It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too, if necessary. Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy-to-carry handles. It's a little difficult to get the fabric folded up and packed into the case, though. Other than that, it's perfect. It's a buy. 
Love it...Love it...Love it!!! Every football fan should have one. It is perfect for tailgating. This is the only site I could find it. Great price and the free shipping is a great deal. It also shipped really fast, faster then it had originally said. 
Lands End's turtleneck sweaters and mock turtlenecks, with long and short sleeves, have been staples in my wardrobe for almost ten years now. I own them in multiple colors, and they look as nicely with dress suits I wear at the office as with jeans and leisure wear. In addition, they are virtually indestructible; few other garments I own survive laundry this well - no matter how often I wash them, they don't fade, thin out or shrink. They're first-rate quality, and at a bargain price to boot 
Land's End Turtlenecks are world famous and rightly so. They fit as promised and last many years. The choice of colors are plentiful and very fashionable. Buy at least one for yourself and every one in your family every year! 
Buy these in quantity every year because they're soft, warm and top quality! They don't shrink and wear like iron 
"Wool and Nylon Blend?" It is impossible to be a responsible consumer if you do not know what you are buying. My poor review is based on this. In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk. Of course, this is only my opinion and preference. However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than "Wool and Nylon Blend?" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for. Stretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot. BUT - if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods. It would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture. The review reflects on "full disclosure in advertising" and not the product itself. Should Amazon find it inappropriate then a deletion is understandable. 
These soacks a superior and are excellent craftmanship. For the hunter they are a requirement 
These are extremely soft and comfortable, they fit true to their size chart ~ form-fitting but not *tight* ~ and work perfectly in a Yoga class. What else are they good for? Sleeping, lounging, hanging around outside, and on and on. They also work layered under a short skirt or shorts, or loose flannel plaid pants for an updated 90's grunge look. ^.~ And no matter how you wear them, they look HOT. Overall these are an extremely versatile article of clothing, useful and comfortable, reasonably priced, and made here in America (FINALLY really American-made wear!!) by workers who earn a living wage. I highly recommend them 
I love these shoes. I ordered this pair and Delectable and they are both great. They're both comfortable, easy to wear shoes for people who really need to be on their feet a lot. I like that the insoles are padded and molded, and not just flat. This pair goes really nicely with jeans. They are a little more dressy, and are a nice mix between comfort and looks. The sizes are exactly as stated on on the sizing chart, so you don't have to second guess them 
Such a cute and comfortable shoe, feels like a sneaker, but dresses up any outfit 
These shoes are awsome! My son absolutely loves them! He says that they have got to be the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned...well worth the price 
I just received these shoes today and here are my impressions. 3:30pm The shoes arrived and I eagerly opened the box and put them on. They feel quite a bit different from other shoes. The sole is VERY springy! The tongue is hurting my right foot and I'm concerned that I am going to need to return the shoes. 4:30pm I take the shoes off and it turns out that the tongue (which is connected to the sides of the top of the shoe where the laces go through)is not centered quite right so I fold it in place and put the shoes back on. I notice a difference instantly. My wife comes home from work and says "I don't like the way they look....but they are your shoes". By 5:30 I don't care how they look because they are soooo comfortable. The soft leather uppers seems to fit the foot perfectly and the soft sole is still really springy. The combination of these two is magnificent. By 7pm I love these shoes so much that I am sitting at the computer writing a review at amazon! I generally wear birkenstock and Dr. Marten shoes so I have spoiled my feet. It is a fantastice surprise to get these shoes and find that they are even MORE comfortable than the Docs or the Birks. I just ordered a pair of the Desert treks.... 
I am 67 years old and have worn these type of shoes most of my life. I started with Hush Puppies and then switched to Wallabees when they first came out. There is a place where you can have them resoled if you wish. Wallabees are highly recommended by me but of course they are not for everyone 
I purchased the Black Wallabee Boots for my son for Christmas. He had a pair of the tan ones, but they don't sell them anywhere close to my home. He's in college in another town. I found them on Amazon, less expensive than what he paid for them in the store. The black ones are sharp! He loves them, and said they are very comfortable. I will keep my eye on any Wallabee Boot sales . . when he likes a shoe, it's a big deal. Thank you. Sand 
Can't beat these shoes for comfort and durability, and the funky classic good looks still appeal after many years - these were purchased at the insistence of my extremely fashion-conscious 13-year-old son! (Should I tell him Dad I wore Clark's Treks in college??) :-) 
This is a great, comfortable pair of shoes. My son loves them and wears nothing else 
My son loves these shoes! He claims they are the most comfortable pair he's ever worn. The brown oily leather is a great look. Please know that these shoes run a little larger than most (ex: Size 10 in these shoes is equivalent to an 11 in others.) 
I got the maroon shorts. I think it is a good price for what we got. The material is a little thin which you can see in the product picture 
I bought 8 shorts (4 Blacks and 4 Blues) in the same order and they are perfect! The description and high quality of the shorts, the fast shippment a delivery are completly succesfull! I'm very glad 
It woul be good if I could purchase two shorts of different colors on the same orde 
I recently bought this item in beige color and the zero wasteband feels amazing. I mean there was no rolling and the color match my skintone. Looks great in boots or any shoes. Also, with parties, weddings, etc...my boyfriend gives me compliments on my legs 
With no waistband, there is still a feeling of control, but no waistband wedging into your waist and creating a roll of flesh above it 
Great shorts, nothing too technical or fancy but do the job. Tight on the hips for a large size, but once on they fit really well and are very comfortable 
I've been cycling with the Performance Canyon Mountain Shorts for three months, and they work great. They're very high quality shorts and comfortable to wear. The Liquicell padding makes a major difference in riding comfort. It's eliminated that tingly, numb feeling that made my riding so uncomfortable. I highly recommend these shorts, and they're a great value 
I bought the boysenberry 7.5M and I am loving it. It is comfortable, stylish and simply lovely. The boysenberry is a beautiful, rich colour. My only disappointment is that it is not a higher heel and not leather. However I still love it. 
This item is beautiful. The company is great. I received many compliments on these shoes. 
I like these shoes. The were comfortable. Made of good material. Stylish and wonderful design. I got alot of compliments on them. I would buy this brand again. 
It's unbelievable that you don't get these for free with the Zen. But, that aside, buy these now. You're going to want them right away to protect the screen. And, the other reviewer is right about putting them on. If you're not careful, when you're squeezing out the bubbles with your nails, you can scratch the protector screen you just applied. So, try to be careful 
I love these khakis. I have worn them for years and suddenly they have disappeared from the stores. When I found them on the web, I ordered them immediately. They fit perfectly and are just as I remembered them to be 
I have been wearing the slippers for about a month now, and find them very comfortable. They appear to be well made and for the price, I don't think you could do better. Lowell Huf 
Sorry for being lazy, but these slippers are very well made, and extraordinarily comfortable. I've had several pairs of what were meant to be high quality slippers in the past and they did not compare to these. You would not regret purchasing these 
Thank goodness I followed previous Amazon reviews -- which encouraged me to buy these slippers. The only unknown is durability -- but they seem very well put together and are very comfortable/sturdy. You won't be disappointed. 
The ad said it would ship within 3-4 days, and I would receive it in 7-10 days after shipment. Then I recieved an email telling me it was scheduled to ship on February 12-14 (10 to 14 days after the order). I RECEIVED the items, in perfect shape, on the fourth day after placing my order! What a wonderful surprise! Thank you! It is the first time I ever found a pair of footwear even close to my size online, and I'm well pleased. I love them 
I purchased these slippers for my husband as a gift. He just loves them. I bought a 13EEE, he normally wears a medium and hoped these would fit, they did perfectly. He likes the idea he can go outside with slippers and they are very sturdy and well made. A great slipper, you can't go wrong if you purchase these. I will buy them again when this pair wears out. 
This is a great slipper at such an excellent price. It is well-made and extremely comfortable. So versatile that it can be worn outdoors as well indoors. The wuality is outstanding 
Was pleased at the quality and comfort (according to my husband) of these slippers. Would recommend these slippers 
These are terrific slippers, well made, warm and comfortable. The size runs a little narrow, if you normally wear D or medium, these will fit just fine 
EEE's are hard to find in slippers. Bought these and my husband loves them 
i bought these for my boyfriend for christmas and he's been wearing them non-stop since then! they are well-made and very comfortable 
I am very happy with these shoes and would only add that they seem to run true to size. I purchased a size 8 and it is a little loose for me in the heel. I range between a 7 1/2 and 8 medium as a rule. 
My son is thrilled with his Tiki Barber replica jersey. I was sure it would make a great Christmas gift and I was not disappointed 
I ordered this for my son's birthday. It came very fast and was exactly what he wanted. We are both very happy with the service and the jersey 
I am very impressed by this garment...it does work. It does take getting use to wearing it. I how recommend you dont go to small But if you want to look like your thinner alot thinner, it hold everything in 
After my first purchase of these jeans I had to order another 2 pair because they are the only pants I will ware now. These jeans are extremely confortable in every way and the do not get cought under a boot heel like most other pants. I HIGHLY recommend these jeans to anyone!!!! 
Smooth to skin, but has static in the dry weather. Overall, good product, and great price; what's not to like 
Very confortable and stylish. The multi-colored shoe is sometimes hard to coordinate with clothes, but its degree of comfort makes it a winning shoe 
Happy with this item. The support is good. material used in this product is nice and soft. Overall a comfortable feeling. 
I bought this rather skeptically online, but turned out that these mittens (and other products from this company) are extremely soft and don't fade or shrink after washes. I'd highly recommend these for your baby's tender hands 
Being a larger breasted woman it is hard to find a bra that fits and feels great, this one does both! I hardly feel it at all while I am wearing it. The lift and support are amazing and is virtually invisible under tshirts. I highly recommend the Bali Live It Up to all women 
This is a compact traveling case. Compact doesn't mean tiny. It is probably one of the smaller of the name-brand standard size ones I've seen (Kenneth Cole, Perry Ellis, Swiss Army, Nautica, etc), but it is not a different size category. Just a different shape, slightly less deep, yet has a nice solid broad base (the bottom is of a solid material which doesn't collapse). It is definitely big enough for the average man's toiletries. I like it. It also doesn't have a lot of inside pockets. There is just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't have its own zipper. Not a mesh. I'm not sure what it's big enough for - floss and lip balm? The rest of the inside is open and free. It has a water-proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide (essential in a toiletries bag really). Well-crafted from what I can tell. The outside is a very handsome patterned leather. It looks aged without looking worn. It also smells of leather out of the box - so much nicer than the faux-leather travel kits. You won't mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage. I have a slight quibble with the handle - it is not as easy to grab as in most kits. It's more of a loop than a handle. So those are the cons: not a lot of compartments inside, not huge. Pros: leather, opens very wide, looks good, durable 
They are sturdy, fashionable, and run true-to-size. The price was very reasonable, and I'm very pleased with my purchas 
Website was easy to use. Product illustration was accurate. Received order in no time at all. Price was better than I expected 
My boyfriend is now the prettiest man in town. Who knew pink was his colour 
I originally purchased these for the cut and color. But after wearing them several times, I've come to appreciate how comfortable and sexy this thong is. The silk is shiny and smooth without being too delicate. My only concern is that the pouch shape is a little off, often requiring adjustments for comfort. Still, a worthy product at a decent price 
Product sent in timely manner in excellent condition. Very happy with the product. A regular customer 
I bought these for my mom, who has always complained of uncomfortable shoes (especially ones with heels). She loved wearing them in the summer. 
These shoes feel just like wearing a pair of slippers. They are the most comfortable shoes i own. 
I bought these for my wife, she has beautiful feet. She noticed them in a add and I surprized her with them. Simple things keep me a Happy guy! Thanks! Scott With Hor 
Excellent quality, made in Italy. But, the size Mediums seemed a little snug...Hope they stretch out (width wise) 
Although the Levi's 505 jean is usually referred to as the zipper version of the classic button fly 501, the Levi's 512 model seems closer to me. If you are looking for the 501 fit without the hassle of buttons, this may be the way to go. The 505 is rather full in the seat and crotch (technically "the rise") and can look pretty baggy. Though described as a "slim fit", the 512 is more of a moderate fit, snug but not formfitting, much like the handsome 501. Rather than slim fit, it really should be described as the 512 "tapered leg", because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle, which means it will not fit over boots, unlike the 505 and the 501. The only real downside of this jean is that comes in only one finish, a rather milquetoast medium stonewash. Over time, however, it breaks in pretty nicely and looks good. 
I ordered ombre blue/aqua colored scarf. The color is darker than in the picture, but still looks very attractive. It is thin and papery, but I believe, thats how pashmina/silk should be. It feels warm when you wear it. Shipping was fast and customer service is good. May be slightly pricy with shipping but you won't find this deal at any other website. I placed an order for two more. 
Best for outdoor activity, investigator,press and concealed gun carry or accessories that require low profile. Wish the price was little cheaper but couldn't be better!! 
But i expected a lot less for the price. All the pockets and clips and everything is really cool, and it even has a two way zipper. While im wearing this thing, I feel like i am ready to defend freedom. EXCELLENT SHIPPING SPEED 
This is undoughtably the best and most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. They comform to your feet readily and wear like iron. You'll feel like you'r "walking on a cloud". Plus they look great and you'll be proud to wear them. 
This is an excellent shoe. It is true to fit and looks great. Note that it is also airport and nuclear plant safe for metal detectors. Very comfortable and fits to your foot shape within days, which is amazing compared to other shoes 
Everthing was fine. I wish they could have hemmed them for me. We are Cool Chuck 
After ordering the shoes I realised that the carriage was almost as much as the shoes, I tried but was unable to cancel the order, on recieving the shoes in perfect condition they were far too small and certainly not the size stated I cannot return them as I would have to pay more again in carriage, I have written to both the company and to Amazon but have not yet had a reply. Due to the fact I have forgotton my password i have been unable to e-mail you about this althoughI have tried on numerous occasions. I hope someone may be able to hel 
I love these EarGrips, I got them about a year ago and they've gotten me through the coldest parts of Minnesota winters just fine. My problem with the things is that there's a slot to put headphones in, but I've yet to find headphones that are small enough to fit. I've come across websites that tell me that the headphones are sold seperately, but heck if you can find them anywhere. Other than that, a great product 
Wonderful product! Small, compact and keeps ears warm even during high wind chills 
I bought my first ear grip from a home improvement store. I work outdoors everyday and really need to keep all exposed areas covered. The Ear Grip works great! Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isnt as noticeable as other options. Since it is worn around the back of the head/neck it also keeps your neck warm too. Compared to other ear muffs I have seen the Ear Grip wont make you look like a fairy. There is no fluff/wild colors/fur here and you are still able to hear out of them. They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric. The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric thats covering it is more than enough to keep you warm. You can also take them off in a flash and compact them with a push and turn so they will fit in any pocket. I highly reccomend them 
I was introduced to Ear Grips over two years ago. Working outside for a school at least 45 minutes a day in Iowa meant some bone-chilling days, and then you have to go in and face people with hat-hair...but not with Ear Grips. They ride low behind your head, and really keep your ears warm. Since being introduced to them, I have spread them to two other family members and several co-workers. Seldom do products deliver so well on what they are supposed to do...but this product really does 
These are a well made, comfortable sock. But unfortuately, the tops are a bit heavy on the elastic and if you are prone to swollen legs, they cut into the calves. Still, a good sock and a good price 
I wanted a travel kit that does not weigh much because the person I wanted to give it to travels a lot on carry-on baggage. I was very happy with the purchase. Despite its light weight, the travel kit looks sturdy and is lined with vinyl, so it is perfect for my purposes 
I purchased this bag for my husband to cart around his daily pills (instead of one of those plasic medicine dispensers that make you take the pills out of the bottle on a weekly basis) and it works great! It also has enough room to fit some travel supplies (i.e. comb, shaving kit, etc) when he goes on the road. I got the olive color and was very pleased to discover the color was not at all like the washed out colors shown in the picture. It was more vibrant and matched better with what amazon shows you for the color pallets. I'm very pleased with my purchase. It's perfect 
Great product at a great price!! Fast shipping too! 
Whether you are a Britney Spears fan or not if you are a fan of light, feminine scents you might want to check out Britney Spears Curious. I notice the name Elizabeth Arden on the credits on the box so if you have worn Elizabeth Arden fragrances before you might like curious. It smells really good. When you first spray it and smell it, it seems strong, but once it completly dries it's a sweet lasting smelling scent. I am totally pleased and the price is just right. The bottle is very unique and stands out among my other scents on my dresser 
Very nice shoes, look good and feel great. Arrived in a good amount of time 
The quality of the tights is great, but they are a little short for someone 6'0 and 173 lb 
I like different shoes and I like to match my shoes with everything that I wear. I purchase these without knowing what I was going to wear them with but when I got them I was pleasantly surprised with the diverse colours in them. They are also very comfortable for casual dress 
Great shoes and great deal. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you 
THESE SHOES ARE EXTREMELY CONFORTABLE and CARRY A TRUE SIZE. MINE ARE GREEN AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT DIED PROPERLY, IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BUT NEVERTHELESS, I WOULD BUY THEM IN ALL COLORS IF THEY WERE MADE. VERY HAPPY WITH THE 
This is a great little training bra. I have looked all over, and on the internet as well. This is a Bestform product and has the best price of just $6.99 each. It's exactly what I expected in a traingin bra. This is for a 7 year old. Most places wanted closer to $20 for a training bra as they called it a sports bra. I love doing business with Bealls...always a great merchant 
These shorts are nicely made of a good fabric for practicing yoga. However, they are extremely short. I opted to trade them in for the somewhat longer version. These work great and are more modest. Sizes seem to be a bit small, so buyers might want to go to the next size up. 
These are very comfortable shorts and I hardly feel as if I have them on 
These shorts are awesome. They fit perfectly, they keep me totally covered, but they're short enough that I stay cool. They're rad. I will be ordering more pairs soon 
I've practiced yoga for almost a decade, and these are the first shorts I've found that perfectly suit my needs. They are short enough that I don't get overly hot, especially in a Bikram or Ashtanga class. They are snug and I know that nothing will be revealed if I bend over. They are also lined in the front and back so I feel extra protected. They are also great quality and last a long time. Made by a great company who puts attention into the details of their products 
The shorts are just fine. They are much more stretchy than anything else I've tried for Bikram, but not overly revealing, even without undergarments. They have a sort of front and back lining so you're not -uh- out there. I like them, and they kind of look like they're meant for yoga 
WOW I am suprised. VERY comfortable. Very stable shoe. I love them!!! They are very sexy. I live in clogs and this one is nice and tall and most important to me they are comfotable. I wear them a lot 
These shoes are so cool, especially for the price, but, the color on the Rust is lighter than what it appears in the photos. They are pretty comfy but really really really high 
I have nothing but raves about these adorable shoes! They give me NO trouble at all walking, and they are different! I'm a real shoe-a-holic, and I love it when I can find cute, comfortable, shoes that aren't "cookie cutters" (the same shoe every brand makes). I have 4 different pairs of Naughty Monkey brand shoes and I love every one of them 
I bought these shoes for a young friend of mine. All I know is he says they are absolutely awesome! He is twelve years old 
I purchased these shoes for my son's basketball season and he loves them. The colors matches his uniform which looks great and they have great support and comfort. Not to mention they are very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend these shoes to other mothers and sons! Karen Peterso 
What a wonderful garment! It holds me in and gives me a wonderful shape, but is comfortable enough to eat in. It is very light, but has amazing control. The stays were a little too long for me (I'm only 5'2"), but I was able to have it altered. I wish it were available in black and nude 
Love Love Love these shoes! they are not nearly as green as they seem online, more like brown olively color. I have these shoes in black/purple too they are so comfortable and perfect for so many occasions. I think i prefer these brown ones now though... 
The sweater is the usual high quality associated with Zegna. However, the material is so thin, it clings to my body. It was probably due to this undesirable feature, that the garment had been discounted so greatly. However, I knew that possibility existed, when I saw the sweater on your website. I initially planned to return the purchase, but later changed my mind. When worn with a jacket, the effect is good 
The Mundi change purse is nice and I can highly reccomend it to anyone looking for one. It is solidly built and can hold a nice amount of change - quite a bit better than the small plastic one I replaced with it. All in all a definite five star product 
This little change purse is perfect for loose change or keeping extra credit cards to business cards that do not fit in your wallet. Great space saver 
I ordered three of these types of items. They were all fairly good but this was the best. I use it everyday 
I have been wearing Wrangler Angler Jeans exclusively for the last 8+ years. The fit is the best. The extra pockets on the right leg come in handy to carry small tools and a pen. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the material is a little light (in weight and color) so they tend to look too worn out too fast. But I can usually get about 18 months out of a pair. The Tan ones wear longer and look good longer. I am truly a fan and hope they make these for a long time to come 
These are an excellent fit, great material, good craftsmanship. Especially for the price 
When I first received these, a present for my 18 yr old son, I was rather surprised at the trim cut of the shearling. But he wore them and was very pleased. He's very active outdoors and liked that they were thinner but warm, offering him a better grip. I wore them myself to shovel some snow once and they kept my hands nice and warm. 
these gloves are really nice quality, very soft both inside and out. The suede is smooth and pliable and the shearling is not too fluffy inside but definitely enough to keep your hands warm and it feels so nice to put your hands in these. I had a problem figuring out size so if it is any help, my husband tried them on and he is 5'9 and wears a size large in clothing. I would say his hands are medium in size, a bit wide but average length of fingers and the medium glove fit perfectly. I hope that helps someone who is having trouble deciding on size, for me that was the hard part. The gloves came tagged with an Amazon hang tag listing the regular price as $79.99 so I am not sure where the price they show comes from but still a great deal. Can't comment on how warm they are since we live in Texas and these are for my father-in-law, who lives in a cold weather state, for next Christmas 
I like the 515 cut jeans (I have very long legs and some curves) so I thought I'd give these shorts a try. I am happily surprised, these are very cute but not too short for this thirtysomething and comfy to boot 
This is a great product. Not only does it make a nice gift for everyone on your gift list, but it also makes for nice lawn ornaments. Highly recommended. 
I bought these for two reasons... Number one being that my son started walking very early and any shoes that my husband and I would buy him, were too hard for him to walk in. Like all shoes, they needed to be 'broken in' and at 9 months, you arent very capable of that. So with these little Uggs, he can walk around in a soft comfortable shoe that isnt hard and bulky. The second reason that I bought them is because they are so dang cute. We get TONS of compliments on them all the time 
My 21 month old twins LOVE their new boots. They bring them to me to put them on them all the time. THey have wide feet and they have no problem getting into these. They walk great in them and don't need socks. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is the soft bottom. If they had the hard bottom they would get more outdoor use, but with the soft bottom they can only walk to and from the car. They also look ADORABLE. At $39 a pair they were worth every penny 
My shopping experience was excellent. I received very quick shipping, and the item I received was just as I had ordered. They were very helpful with my questions and very cooperative. 
Great price but I suspect most people will want to pay a little more and get a better quality cap. Like another reviewer, my cap also arrived a little too large (I'm going to try his suggestion of machine washing drying it) 
The hat fits just right, material is great and the price is the best I foun 
I printed out their hat-sizer thing and cut it out according to the directions. My hat ended up being just a little too big. I threw it in the washer and the dryer (even though the tag said not to) and it shrunk enough to fit pretty well now actually...and it still looks fine 
These camisoles are so comfortable and run true-to-size The company selling them has very fast shipping and products arrive in 2 or 3 days. I highly recommend both this camisole and the company 
These are perfect, since I can no longer open/close the tiny hooks on my bras (partial paresthesis of arms/hands). I wish I could get more, in more colors too.. 
I got 3 pairs of them -- for my father, brother and boyfriend. They all loved it. Very classic and comfortable. Also, I recommended a friend to get a pair and he loves them as well. Very very good purchase. Clarks rocks 
The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing. Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers. Haagar has done a terrific job again 
This windbreaker/rainjacket is exactly what my dad was looking for. Lightweight, no lining, nice sky blue color. I searched everywhere and am thrilled to have found it here 
great long sleeve shirt, i wear mine all the time. very warm and comfortable. it is slim-fitting so if you like your shirts looser then get a size up 
I love this case. I used to have one of the new iSkins but since the ipod wouldn't fit in my car charger/FM tuner with the skin on, it took forever to peel it off everytime I wanted to use it in my car. This works much better for me. It's easy to quickly access and remove the ipod from the case for car use, but the rest of the time it's a great case to bring on trips. The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly. The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it. My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin. If you are going to be taking the ipod out of the case on a regular basis, this is a great alternative to the iSkin 
Nice quality, great design, quick delivery Was very pleased with the product and enjoying it very much 
I've bought variations of this shoe in suede and leather, but this little number is flat-out gorgeous! A low-key metallic that is as comfortable as a sneaker, and yet you look absolutely kewl wearing it just about anywhere. The silver flat actually looks great with a gown (when you're walking and don't want to destroy your feet in heels.) You can dance and have fun in them and look great; or just put them on to drive and switch to the tottering heels when you get to the ball. (But I bet you won't - these shoes look great anywhere.) I'm definitely going to be investing in them in all three metallics! I'm already on my fourth pair of this style of Skechers, and I'm just praying they keep making them. Best walking and looking shoe I ever owned 
The shirt is true to the description. It's lightweight, fit's true to size, wicks away sweat, dries quickly, and looks good. Heads up, it is so lightweight with thin fabric that the wearers undergarment can be seen through the material 
This is the black verson jock from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. A good buy 
WOW!!!!! This jock is ten times better that their previous jocks, at least by my standards. The pouch is bigger, softer, less constricting and all around, just more cofortable. It has a nice modern look and feel. I actually bought this at a local sports store. I am very pleased and will get another one, probably the white one. I am actually wearing it now under my suit and can't tell I have a jock on. It is that comfy!!!! Love it and highly recommend it. Thanks 
I use these sneakers for work becuase im on my feet for 11 hours. I have no pain on my feet at the end of he day. I highly advise any looking for real comfort to get the Adidias Megabounce 
I have always been an adidas man... And as usual this time too I was not disappointed. Fits excellently. Not too sure what to do with those spare insoles though 
If you are the kind of person who can't stand a big wallet this is for you. Surprisingly you can fit a good amount in this and it is no bigger than a credit card. Right now I have 6 bills, 2 credit cards, license, and a few business cards. 
Russell Track Pants are terrific. Cheap, comfortable, durable and last just about forever. I prefer the ones without pockets though their tough to find in stores now - so glad Amazon still had them. The elastic ankles - though not as fashionable - are very practical for in house wear and stretching since the pants won't fall down or slip 
The pants seem to be good quality, fit well, comfortable, easy to wash, durable, reasonably priced. We are very satisfied with this purchase 
Excellent buy for the money. Nice quality fabric, ingenious construction. Great to have in the car, for traveling or camping. 
it protects to you totally of rain. It is easy to keep and to transport. It is excellent. It is a great investment cost/value 
I purchased the Vaneli Black Patent pumps and I am thrilled with my purchase. The shoes are true to size and quite comfortable. 
This shoe looks classy, and is comfortable, even for someone who wears a wide width - like mysel 
After looking high and low for pointed toe navy pumps, I was so glad to find these 
There's one major flaw with Bostonian square toes - I have three pair so trust me when I say this: you can't find inserts/insoles for them. The shoot fits snuggly and comfortably, the backs don't wear out and cause pain to your heels, but the insole goes flat in less than a year and you'll be donating the shoes as there's no way to find square-toe inserts; Bostonian says they neither make nor can suggest where to find square toe inserts. 
I bought this shirt because it looked great and we call our little bar the Tiki Lounge. When it arrived, I found that not only is it great looking on a tubby guy like me, but the grass skirt is fringe that moves. Great shirt, gets lots of compliments. It's thick and well made. You can't go wrong 
I got the NFL folding tail gate chair to enjoy those times in the park and ball field and especially at draft day for the NLF. waiting on line for hours dressed in your favorite team outfit (Go Vikings) to show support. and nothing shows it more then relaxing on line sitting in these football folding chairs in your teams color and emblem. it does beat standing for hours or sitting on a cold dirty sidewalk 
i got and love it. however, someone else's product was shipped inside the box. it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box. the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it. I contacted them and sent it to them myself. it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy. I hope all that get things for others send it to them too! you never know whose life depends on it 
I think the chair is great sturdy and exactly what I was looking for in my game roo 
I was very pleased with this chair. It is well built and VERY comfortable.The receiver of the gift is very happy. I would biuy this again 
This is very portable and at the same time very sturdy. Perfect for the patio or to take to grandson's soccer games 
I bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets. He LOVES everything about it - especially the fact that it is the Bears! = 
Thanks, Amazon. Product arrived before I expected it. My boyfriend LOVES his Redskins chair. Right now, he's got it set up in his backyard...this gift may haunt me. I may be seeing this chair for years to come on every beach, park, or park outing. As of now, I am winning the argument that it shouldn't be used in our tv room 
I love these. They are so comfortable and of excellent quality 
I bought this hat for my son and he loves it. It wears and washes well and he will get a couple more winter season out of it 
Very comfortable, great for working out at the gym. These pants do run a bit small as far as addidas pants go I wish I would have gotten a size bigger 
This product is great, keeps the IPOD in place when you are exercise, and if it falls it doesn't hit quite as hard 
What a fun and stylish way to wear and protect your ipod. It is just so unfortunate that the shipping on this item is $8.49. Yes, you read that right. Over 8 dollars for shipping. And I am talking standard shipping within the United States. The USPS offers a flat rate Priority Mail envelope, which would be more than big enough to fit this item in, for $3.85. What a fleecing these people are trying to perpetuate on us. It is just like those "cheap" cell phones on e-bay with $35 shipping charges. I guess it is a matter of how desperately you want your Nano to be pink 
This particular shoe is the best i've ever worn. With my own inserts it is very comfortable . i work on my feet all day and at the end my feet still feel good. I love the look ,feel ,style ,i just wish they came in black. i actually bought two pairs and had 1 died Black and they really look good .Looks like they camethat way. You can wear them with Jeans as well as dress pants .Either way they look grea 
Writing this review 3 weeks after the purchase...wore this shoe couple of times,excellent leather ofcourse its Clarks...well my brother has Clarks who's been using it for the past 3 yrs,its serving him real nice,mine goes well with casuals..i'm lil uncomfortable with the size...reason might be the shoe needs more time to blend in with my feet...overall its a nice shoe...than 
I was very excited to get these boots, they looked to be excellent quality and a great value. I ordered them in plenty of time to take them on our planned weekend away. They did not arrive, instead I recieved some sort of excercise ball in what was suppose to be the boots. I immediately contacted AMAZON because at that point I only had 3 days before my trip. I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake. They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly. I did and FOGDOG said sorry, we can only send you the boots if you order, pay for them again and pay for the express shipping. Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase. I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store. I am still waiting for the refund of the excercise ball and it has been 3 weeks. After many great purchases from Amazon over the years I am now saidly disappointed. This will change my Amazon purchase plans in the future. 
I like this boot. It is durable, warm and practical. I leave them loosly tied so that I can slide my feet into them and go. Good price too 
This is a great jacket. I could not find a decent lightweight nylon jacket at any store locally, so I took a chance and ordered this one from Amazon/Turfer. It is made very well and looks and fits great. I could not be happier with the jacket or Turfer. 
Great fit, great color, used for camping for boyscouts. Decent price. 
I work as a model and this is the best for me professionally and personally. Comfortable and no lines 
I got these shoes for my husband, and he loves them. They wear like tennis shoes, but they look a little more dressy 
These shoes are very comfortable and have a rugged sole. I use them as business casual shoes as well because they are discreet enough. 
Fast delivery-shoes are beautiful and extremely comfortable. I had bilateral foot surgery in March of 2005 and these shoes are wonderul. Definately would buy from again 
I bought this wallet because I had alot of things in my back pocket and was tired of digging through it all to get my id out. Initially, I saw the leather band around the outside and thought it looked really good, so I got it. It has alot of slots for cards and other things, two clear slots for ids and looks just as good as it did on the computer. Again, it's form AND function, serving it's purpose and looking good at the same time........P 
I ordered this shirt in a large for my husband he is not a hard to fit large. This large is a bit short. The seller did ship fast though 
Sexy, practice, confortable, discrete under clothing. I had a couple in 98 and I just loved them. I`m glad I found it again I just whish it could still have in color Champagne 
I was looking for a good quality pair of shoes with leather soles. Leather sole shoes are getting harder and harder to find in stores. The Bostonian line of shoes at Amazon.com filled the bill for me. They are excellent quality at an affordable price 
If you want a well-made sturdy camisole, this is for you. I, personally, was looking for a microfiber-type product. This one is not (nor is it advertised to be), and I find the material to be a bit on the heavy side for my taste. BUT, I didn't return the camisole and wear it happily nnonetheless 
Very soft and comfy. Good support. Straps don't slide or cut in. A bit sheer so better suited for layering or lounging. Perfect for sleepwear. Nice colours 
Socks are comfortable although they make my feet sweat more-so than they would have. On runs of 4+ miles they will really be wet feeling. Sizing is like any other no-show sock. A large will usually fit 10-13 so if you wear an 11 like I do buy the medium socks. They stretch. A large size will be baggy and come high on a size 11 shoe. Socks start to fuzz up if dryed with high heat, use low heat and cold water to preserve. Now buy em and start running! Good sock 
i bought these for my wife, she loved the shoes but the first day she wore them they really hurt her feet. I guess that is a normal thing with womes shoes according to her. I would have given them 5 stars, but the fact that they were uncomfortable the first day i gave them 
Great Service from Amazon. Great coat. Great price. Long enough to keep my husband's bottom covered and warm. Medium is generously sized. 
This is a very sexy outfit. My one complaint is that the "3 piece set" is actually two pieces; the top being one while the skirt is attached to the g-string. This doesn't take too much away from the outfit, but it would have been nice to have been given a more accurate description of the product before buying it 
It looks very sexy! I'm a size 4 and it fits perfectly. The items are elastic and I assume it could fit many sizes. Besides, it's fabric feels confortable. Shipping is fast as well. I'm very happy abouth the purchase 
I like the peek-a-book look, you know, how you can see a hint of flesh between those stripes. The G-string isn't as tiny as some of the thongs out there. The three bows give the piece kind of a little girl gone bad kind of look, if that's the kind of fantasy you're into. A real baby doll look. I can't imagine a man who wouldn't go gaga over a girl who changed into this when she said she was just going to slip into something more comfortable. I know when I saw this drapped over a female form I went gaga 
I think I look really sweet and sexy in this and that's saying something, because I've never seen myself as a sweet and sexy kind of girl. The opposite in fact. It is really something how an outfit like this can give you a whole new opinion of yourself 
You just have to love an outfit like this. It says sexy, without giving away the store to your man's eyes. He's gotta look, keep those eyes glued on you to see what you know he wants to see. And I really love the pink trim, the way you can get hints of it showing off the G-string through those see through stripes 
I can't get over how good I look in this. I just stared at my reflection in the mirror. I almost wanted to make love to myself right then and there. This three piece proves that you don't have to show it all to be very, very sexy 
My daughter is happy with this purchase and her friends like it to 
These are the best shoes I've bought in several years. They are ultra comfortable AND stylish. Buy them, your feet will thank you 
I bought this for my fiancee as a christmas present. I looked all over including the homepage for the Chicago Bears any couldn't find this shirt.It was exactly what he had been looking and an awesome price. Everything about the transation was 5 stars. The quality to it shippping so quickly and a week before Christmas. 
I bought this shirt for myself....I love it, it fits well, and still looks new after multiple washings. I received this product faster than the estimated time and was very happy with the service. 
The Chicago Bear Touchdown T-Shirt is a great product for all NFL fans. I really like the style of the t-shirt with the big logo. The shirt was not flashy and simply lets people know what team you support. The delivery was very timely and I was completely satisfied with my experience. Kudos to the people at Amazon 
This shawl is soft, cozy, warm...a perfect wrap for the winter. I'm getting one for all my friends this Christmas-it couldn't be better priced. 
I gave it 1 more star than hot swimmer because I consider the pilling to be very minor. I have washed my shirt every week for a year and the pilling is barely noticeable. After a year the shirt looks great, I bought more because I have been a dull guy wearing the same black shirt every time I go to the gym. Oh yeah, a major reason for selecting this shirt is it hangs loose around the waist. This is good because paunches are not emphasized. The competition's shirts(Nike) allow you to show off your "cut" abs, I don't have any, so this is a good shirt for me 
I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning several of these Tech T-shirts, also own several each of the Loose Gear shirts (0084) and the Heat Gear compression shirts (0039) - I've written reviews on those as well. The Tech T-shirt (0382) feels really good on your skin - like your favorite, most comfortable old cotton t-shirt. It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it's not shiny/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look. The tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it's supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation. The tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like the cotton ones. While I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour's "budget" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven't worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I'm going to venture that the tech t-shirt won't be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it's about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for. When stacked up against UA's other shirts, I'd say the tech tee is for you if: 1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt. 2) You don't care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt. 3) You want a shirt that's a little roomier. 4) You want a shirt with stretch in it. 5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt 
These shoes are HOT HOT HOT SEXY SEXY SEXY.... but they are NARROW... AND I even went up two sizes to try to fit them...boo hoo... they are still sexy and if you have a narrow foot you'll get lots of attention from wearing them 
The shoes are beautiful! Not only are they classy but comfortable to walk in despite the high heel 
I have these in both black and brown, and I wear them nearly every day. I walk to work and back and other than the first day of use, they required very little break in and they are just comfortable and great. Note that my feet are not wide, I have no idea what the width of my foot is, but I just buy normal sizes when I get shoes - if you have to go wider, perhaps this would not be the boot for you. The only downside is that I normally wear a 13 in shoes - but these are too big for me at that size, so I really should have gotten a 12. 
I ordered these boots from Amazon at Xmas time. I am glad I bought them and I was lucky they were 50% off then. Lots of my friends had plenty of compliments about them. I wish I had bought them in brown also at the sale price. As always the Amazon shipping and service was top notch. Too bad this time they are only offered by Macy's and at regular price 
I was a little hesitant to order these as the only size available was 1/2 size below what I usually wear, and other reviewers had mentioned true sizing with these boots, such that you shouldn't order half a size larger or smaller, but rather your standard size. These fit great, though, and I've loved them 
Awesome looking and very comfortable, be sure to get a size smaller than you normally would wear. I wear a 13, but ordered a 12 based on other reviewers, and they fit perfectly. I wear these with jeans on casual Friday's at work all the time 
Those boots are of the excellent quality that one comes to expect from Kenneth Cole products. Great price and super fast shipping 
I bought these just before New Years and accidentally spilled wax on them being too "festive." Thankfully Amazon is offering them at half the price I paid at a major B retailer. This boot has great style and very soft leather. It fits exactly as advertised so get the size you normally wear 
These shoes are comfort and light weight. I have arch pain. And these shoes reduce some of my arch pain 
I bought this shoes after reading many positive reviews. My work requires me to stand for a prolonged period of the day. I have bought many other name branded shoes such as Kenneth Cole, Cold Hann (with nike hybrid, Boss..etc..they are not as comfortable as Clarks. I give this shoes a nice 5* and i refer to others too 
I've been wearing Olga underwear for many years. These were a nice discovery. I like the wide lace band just below the waist. There are no lines under my clothing 
These are high quality sandals and cute to boot 
I bought this for a 10 day trek across africa, followed up by a North Pole trek. What a challenge to get to operate, and when it did start to operate it would stop recording mid day. Also battery life is weak, didn't make it across africa. PS I'm a computer geek, so it may be user error but doubtful 
I bought this watch as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it! It does everything you can imagine and he has fun showing it off, but it's practical uses are undeniable. He is a mountain biker and uses it for elevation, speed, barometer, altimiter, and the GPS directions. He is also a Land Surveyor and he uses the GPS and compass daily. He would recommend it to anyone serious about a GPS watch. It is the best we've found and I did my homework before I purchased it--others just don't compare 
These pants have LOTS of room in the legs! I am gonna have to get more of 'em 
YOU CAN RUSSELL AROUND WITH THESE TEES AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY THEYRE VERY HIGH IN QUALITY AND PRICED RIGHT .I HAVE BOUGHT 20 OR SO OF THESE .THEY REALLY HOLD UP WELL 
I bought the navy for my boyfriend. He's tall--around 6'2"--and he often has problems finding shirts long enough in the torso, but this shirt solves that problem. If you're long-waisted, I recommend buying the "tall" size. He finds the shirt extremely comfortable and I think it looks good on him. It's good for casual or exercise wear. The material is very light weight, flexible, and soft. The shirt also has a slimming quality because of how it drapes. You really can't beat the price. 
good looking shirt, but in the picture you dont see the tag embossed on the lower front left. Thinner fabric than expected as the white is see-thru 
I recently ordered this sports bra through amazon, and am very pleased with it. It is cute on both sides (the solid white side with navy stitching and navy mesh back, and the solid navy mesh side), and it's the rare white sports bra that I would feel comforable wearing alone on runs outside -- the double layering with the navy mesh keeps it from being see-through even when drenched in sweat. Speaking of sweat, even after a hard workout this sports bra kept me feeling dry and comfortable, as well as secure. The only slight drawback is the small reflective label in the middle of the back - it felt slightly scratchy when I first put the sports bra on, but I forgot all about it within a few minutes of starting my workout and didn't feel any scratching from that point onward. I imagine that with repeated washings, even the initial slight scratchiness would disappear. And even though this item did not ship directly from amazon, shipping was fast from essentialapparel and I had no problems 
I bought this beanie for my husband. He just loves it. Now my 17yr old grandaughter discovered it and she wants to wear it all the time. I guess I will have to order another one so they don't have to share. Very fast shipping too. 
The Beyond Yoga line of clothing is just incredible. Very soft and unlike any other yoga clothes I've felt or seen. I wear these Beyond Yoga Capris to class and they perform wonderfully. Then I go shopping afterward and don't feel like I'm wearing exercise clothing because they're so cute. I love the lotus drawing on the back and the way they flare at the bottom. I would recommend anything from this line 
Great fit. Very warm! It's below zero outside with wind chill factored in and I never feel the need to layer something over this beanie. The hat pulls down tight and stays put when I strap on goggles and pull up a face/neck warmer 
I took a gamble over the holidays for my b/f as he's very selective when it comes to clothing. I picked this one since he prefers beanies with a smaller/shorter top. After some speculation, he was nice enough to try it on. He loves it, he wears it almost every day! And it keeps him warm too.. 
I agree with D. Katz 100 percent. This item is horrible. I bought it at 5 dollars and I still regret it. The worst thing is that it is looks horrible. If it performed badly at least I could look good but it didn't even have that 
nice burgandy-ish color, leather is sturdy, yet comfortable. Cute style, slightly larger heel than Clarks usually has. Also, gives a bit of o squeak the first few times u wear them Overall nice shoe, should be durable too 
These are great looking and overall I am pleased. They run about a half size small. I was able to make it work because of the open back 
I bought a pair of these online last week (against my personal rule never to buy shoes online!) because the price was so good. I even bought up a 1/2 size to be sure that they would fit. I own other Clarks shoes, but in my experience clogs tend to run a bit small. Even buying up a 1/2 size, these shoes are a bit too small and narrow. I'm going to try to stretch them out and keep them, because they are really cute, but be warned, size up 
I know one person said they could put 4 loads of laundry, but I put in 2 pairs of pants, a towel and other clothing - just about 2 loads. The very first time I lifted the bag, and put the strap over my shoulder to do laundry, it ripped where the top strap is sewn to the bag. So it is worthless to me. Not durable. I am not pleased 
I did not purchse this bag for my own personal use but (while being large) was not quite large enough to serve it's intended purpose so it was given to me. I've used it quite a bit already and it has held up incredibly well with heavy contents, and holds quite a bit (well over 4 loads of laundry). I like it. 
Great shoe. Very comfortable and lightweight. Sturdy and easy on the eyes. But buy with care. They run large and I suggest you buy a size smaller than you wear. My shoe size is 10 1/2 and the men's 9 is just right 
I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, both in a size large. The pajamas fit nicely, but the robe was WAY too big! I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online. Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund, and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange. So, now I have to re-order the robe in a smaller size, and the price has gone up $7 since Valentine's Day. This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size, but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed. MORAL: Order one size smaller than you think you need. 
I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas. He absolutely loved it--the color, the texture, everything. After searching around on the internet, it was one of the best deals, as well. The gift arrived quickly and without any problems. I highly recommend 
The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift! Thanks again! :- 
The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there. Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time 
I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else. Happily, I was wrong. This robe is well-made, comfortable, and it really looks nice. 
The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful. 
I bought this item as bridesmaid dress for my friend's wedding. Package arrived 2 days after I placed order. Impressive! I measured myself but still ordered one size up since this item was described as junior dress. Shouldn't have done that. Their size chart is pretty accurate. Now it needs some minor alteration, but that's fine. This dress looks absolutely stunning. Before making this purchase, I've tried local stores and other websites. You can't beat the price of this dress, and the quality of the fabric is not bad at all. 
My favorites, retail stores never have anything bigger than size 10. And the price is right. 
This shoe is true to fit in every way. It's very comfortable and secure feeling. I can wear the shoes all day and never feel any discomfort. I bought them in black and they look really nice with any slacks 
As I approach 50, I find myself in retro mode. I sought out the adidas I loved in grade school and found them. Having purchased the blue (Rom's) I found them to look every bit like the orignals. I got many flattering comments. However, you get what you pay for; these are not the most high quality shoe. They are one size too tight. If you buy one size larger you'll be fine, but wear them sparingly for looks, not performance. I'm going to buy a second pair, but this time a size larger 
I like the design simplicity of this shoe but don't use it for jogging or running as you will feel uncomfortable. I guess it is made for walking 
These shoes are awesome! They fit a little tight, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. They're also pretty fashionable. I would definitely recommend these for anyone, men and women. It was a great purchase. Free shipping is also included so if you are intrested I would tell you to go for it! 
So glad I went ahead and ordered this before Christmas. My boyfriend loves them, and they got to my house two days later, even thoughit could have taken until Jan. 10th. I knew I could wait to give the present and save money, but fortunately I didn't even have to. Super light, comfortable, and look great with jean 
I redeemed a gift certificate to purchase my Betula by Birkenstock Woogie Mocha Nubuck 3 Strap Sandals-742483. I decided to indulge myself, and I'm glad I did--they are very comfortable, and also attractive. I'm very pleased with my purchase 
Very comfortable and stylish. Looks great when your wearing just the trunks 
I have been trying to publish a Wikipedia article about this particular brand and cut of male underpanty, but after several rejections I am forced to come ...here. At any rate, I find this underwear very stylish and I have the unanimous approval of any fortunate enough to see me donning them, male or female. My problem with them is that they wear out too quickly. Granted, I alternate between only two pairs. They breathe rather well but after 6 months or so they are A) rather dingy B) have running seams C) both. When I wear them I have the confidence that I could drop my pants in front of anyone without embarassment. Sometimes, while waiting for someone to come over, I make a point to put my pants on last. I enjoy walking outside to get the mail in them, and generally walking the line between nudity and clothedness, a joy any fellow metrosexual surely shares. In conclusion, they are the best cut I have found (and I have searched the universe, so to speak). They have helped me "close the deal" several times, because they are simply gorgeous. They could be less expensive, if you ask me. 
When I first bought these over the summer as a last resort before I went to Europe, I was skeptical and I wasn't sure if I liked them or not. Now that I'm back in the states to the cold winters of the Northeast, I've decided that I really do like them. They're design lifts everything out of the way, which is very comfortable - no re-adjusting necessary. They're a good buy 
I really love these underwear, almost as much as the model wearing them. Unfortunately they look "bigger" on him than mine do. ; ( 
these are by far the best pair of underwaer i have ever worn. not only do they improve your profile, but they keep the package in great position while wearing making them the best fit ever. i have already ordered more. 
Who wouldnt want a better profile? I was very excited with my purchase, however I was quickly disapointed. The sling hurt and didnt fit my private area comfortably. After one wash, the underwear shrunk. Love low rise, but these pair were too low. My crack was showing!!!!! 
I actually enjoyed these underwear and it took some getting used to. I consider myself a savvy internet shopper and have had great experiences. Freshpair.com's service is not timely and quite hard to get a hold of. My order took over a month to receive. Four emails later they finally responded with a 10% off coupon; which was insulting. I suggest Amazon.com for most of your shopping; FRESHPAIR NO 
The sling doesn't really do much... the underwear is sized very small, so make sure to order your size accordingly. When they say low profile, they really mean it. If you really want underwear with a sling, go buy some elastic and put into your current tighty whities. 
These shoes are great. I bought myself a pair and wear them everywhere. I even wear them to work. I'm getting them for all family members for Christmas. Even the babies. 
Girls, this underwear is great for comfort (my girlfriend loves them) and it's sexy enough to keep your man's interest. We don't like no granny panties, OK 
It IS the only underwear I will ever use. The quality of the brand speaks for itself 
These panties fit and feel great. They never ride up in the rear, and they don't show above today's lower rise pants. I completely wore out my last 3-pack so I'm very glad to see these are still in production 
I've been wearing these for over 15 years and love them! They are cool, comfortable, cute and sexy at the same time AND they last a long time. Although I'm a size 4, I have a "full caboose" and these accommodate that very well. One of the other things I just can't stand is when the bottom rides up (like those boy shorts)in the rear and these don't do that with me. 
I've worn these panties for years. They are comfortable, long-lasting, and attractive. Best of all, they never wedge up on me. Everyone needs cotton underwear, and as far as I'm concerned, Jockey makes the best. I will keep wearing these as long as they make them 
received after about 9 days...made of authentic material...fit well...the proportioning might not fit a little boy thoug 
This was a very professional elegant combo set for the price. I have yet to find anything that can compare 
Underpriced. Prompt delivery. Excellent quality. Waist pockets are fake. Matching tie is also really nice. Undersized, (minus 1 star) order the next size up 
This doesn't come across on the pic as well as in person. Well made, excellent buy, great vendor. Prompt, have used before and will again 
I really like this item. Its extremely comfortable and very stylish for a man's slipper. Also its' seemingly strong. Great bu 
Stylish and durable would describe these men's slides by Cherokee. Casual activities around the house can be done in comfort wearing these good-looking, quality leather slides. Thick rubber soles provide support for walking around the yard or the mall 
I ordered it in bronze even though I wasn't sure what I was buying. It's more like a brown, a beautiful satin brown! I can only say good things about this jacket. The rouching is elastic so, besides it's a roomy jacket, it gives more space for movement. It can be dressy or not and is eye catching because its rouching is hard to find in other jackets. I've gotten many compliments on it!. Also, it's light weight. I ordered size L and wear it with a thick sweater underneath. I love it and the price too 
I ordered the cranberry scarf with the matching hat for my daughter for Christmas. She loved the set as it is light weight and not bulky for packing for her honeymoon. Thank you for making these gifts available. 
Very Comfortable. I like the compression, but stays dry with intense exercise. Keeps the cold out and body heat in. 
If you're tired of the one-color dri-powers (which are very functional) this adds a bit of style and keeps the original functionality. Particularly if you have a huge expanse of shoulder-to-shoulder area, this breaks up the monotony a little. Monocolor dri power tees work fine but these make the wear interesting enough to not look like something you'd wear as a shirt, and not under your shirt The material is just as good, wicking away sweat fast. I've realized that the wicking keeps the dampness from creating that gym sock smell. Fresh sweat, gross as it sounds, doesn't have that sickening odor. And when it gets to evaporate fast, you can last a little longer before smelling like socks. I find the dri-powers most valuable if you have to go bike to get a coffee or small groceries and you don't want people in the store maintaining a perimeter around you 
These shoes were perfect for the occasion I used them for. They were pretty comfortable and absolutely adorable. They came quickly, which was also appreciated. I can't wait to wear them again 
VERY fast delilvery. Excellent quality merchandise. Would order from this company again 
Wife was pleased with the bra altough she had to repair one of the hooks. 
Good quality handbag. Medium size is big enough to carry everyday necessities even when that includes quite a bit! Seller honored return/exchange policy. 
I've loved wearing the two pairs of these sandals that I have, and they've held up really well. The tan ones have been fine, but the blue-dyed ones got wet once, and they stained my feet blue quite badly. It was very hard to remove, and I went around with very odd-looking feet for quite a while. I'd like to buy more because they adjust to fit my narrow feet, but I'm afraid the black ones will stain my feet black if I get caught in the rain 
I had one of these sandals and they lasted me a long time. They are awfully comfortable sturdy and flexible. The adjustable straps lets you adjust the sandals if you are wearing socks and need extra room to wiggle your toes. However, if you are flat footed this sandal does not provide much of an arch support. This was one of the first pairs of sandals I bought before I was diagnosed with a really bad case of flat foot / feet and had to swtich my footwear. I cannot believe the price at which these sandals are available. You cannot beat the price! 
Early in the '90s I happened to buy a pair of these and I have always had a good pair and an aging pair since then. They are extremely comfortable and they give me an excellent sense of being solidly on the ground. I wear these so much that even over the winter the stripes on my feet never go away completely! 
I bought 3 pairs of these sandals a few years ago and have worn them out. The footbed is very comfortable and I like the adjustable buckles for the ability to wear under different circumstances (with socks, weight loss or gain, etc.). Walking is very comfortable for me in these sandals; they are my shoe of choice for walking where a closed toe shoe is not necessary. Lately, I have been looking and looking for more of these sandals. I don't like Velcro fasteners and was very happy to get 2 new pair. I'm going to buy more in different colors. More colors are available online than the department store I recently visited 
These are very comfortable and are an excellent value. Pockets easily handle 2 tennis balls. Would have been nicer if the Adidas logo was embroidered instead of silk screened 
Mesh shorts aren't usually that shiney, but these are. The tissue is very light by which it can be roomy (lot of tissue) but still keep a nice form. The pockets are small, but one could not expect more when the tissue is that light. Delivery was in a week (for Europe), I could not expect better 
These are by far the most comfortable Sheer Knee Hi's I've purchased. They are available in a variety of colors rather than in only two or three shades. The invisible reinforced toe does not cause any discomfort when wearing pointed toe shoes. The elastic band does not pinch the leg. They resist multiple washings without tearing and once dry, return to their original shape. The material does not itch when worn in warm climates 
I bought these shoes in my usual size and had to exchange them for a half size smaller... They are great shoes, but they run big! 
American Apparel (aa) produces the best shirts in America. Great style and fit are the hallmark of an outstading conpany. Help America produce more jobs and look great too. Support American Apparel and other american companies. I love my aa shrits 
I bought these right before Xmas. I love them. Well made, cute boots 
I wanted these boots when they first came out in the fall, but I refused to pay $159 for them. My mom loves wedge heeled boots, so luckly I found them here for $45 WoW. I purchased a pair for myself and my mom. After wearing them my mom had to have all of the colors in the line. Unfortunately, I was not so luck to find them again for that price, but I purchased them for $89. I still love them they are worth every penny and you can wear them all day. They work with any outfit. Good job to Aerosoles!! 
This is a beautiful boot! Very nice fit and good shape. Also very comfortable and easy to walk in. Great casual or dressy. I definitely recommend them 
I purchased these boots because I have another pair of Aerosoles, that I've been wearing for almost 3 years that are SO comfortable. The heel is a bit high for me, which makes my food slide down to the frong (maybe they run a little big)? I do get a bunch of compliments on these shoes though. Overall, I am not dissapointed. 
I love these boots. I usually wear 7.5 or 8, I ordered the size 8. Perfect fit. They are comfortable too. Would order again. 
I really like this boot. I wear a 7.5 and a 7.5 fit perfectly with a medium pair of socks. I like the look. I have wider calves so this was great for me, but might now work if you have thin calves. The only reason I didn't give it a five was because after a few wears the seam on the back of the boot split by the ankle. I went the the aerosoles website and called the service number. It had been within a month (their guarantee) and so they sent me a new pair. You have to ask to get the postage sent to you. They were very nice and on the phone said this wasn't a normal occurrence, so an exchange for the same boot was fine. 
I love them, they are very comfortable and that is important to me. I have them in black and I am also ordering them in the Brown color. I just wanted to share the news of my love for these boots 
These boots are very cute and super comfortable! They are even better than I thought they would be and I am thinking of even buying another color. I would strongly suggest buying a pair, you won't be let down. 
I just got these in the mail last week... They came free shipping via Amazon in a huge, well padded box right to my front door. I decided to purchase these after reading the reviews for them on the zappos website and all the positive reviews on there. These are MUCH lower priced on Amazon and a great deal. I wore these out for the first time Friday night and although they have high heels, they aren't the hardest or most uncomfortable things to walk in. I'm thinking for a neighborhood stroll or most activities these would be fine, maybe not a whole day of walking/shopping. They have plenty of room to stuff in your jeans if you want. On jeans with a thinner leg, you can't really get by with wearing the boot under the jean or you can see the outline of the boot under there. I'm definilty satisfied with this shoe purchase. 
I'm keeping the boots even though they look different than I thought they would. In the picture on Amazon, the boots looked a lot more reddish pink. In actuality, the boots are more pepto-bismal pink. They are still cute, but different than pictured. Also, the sizes seem to run a bit big. I am normally a 7, so I ordered a 7, and my feet are swimming in them. It's nothing I can't fix with 2-3 pairs of socks though 
Just gorgeous and so much fun! Enough room at the top to tuck your pants in and adorable with a skirt or capris. Great quality. Lots of prints to choose from. 
These boots are gorgeous, fit true to size, and absolutely puddle-worthy. I've gotten so many complements on the unusual pattern! Colors were a little different than the picture suggests: there's a little more light green than I thought there would be, but this doesn't bother me at all. Great product 
Add lots of fun to any event! Lots of attention and well priced too 
It was exactly as described, nicely made. Perfect to top my holiday dres 
these are officially licensed gloves. the quality was much more than i expected. its made out of a nice leather material and the finger wholes are sewn in a way that they don't loosely move around but actually grip around your fingers. there is even some extra padding inside the glove underneath the metal plate. roughly 5-6 inches lon 
This product is great. It protects my MP3 player from scratches and it arrived quickly 
This bundle includes everything you need to use your Zen Vision M since it comes with nothing. I use the portable charger all the time since I have a laptop which is only on when I am using it. Without the portable charger my player would be dead all the time! I recommend this bundle 
Just having bought a Creative Zen M, mainly so I could walk laps on my driveway with it, I needed someway to clip it to my clothes. Found this and bought it. LOVE it! Bright magenta skin slipped on easily and works very well. The belt clip is good. The chargers are WONDERFUL! No depending on a computer to charge my Zen. Well worth every penny 
To begin, this package arrived way ahead of schedule and with no problems. The skin fits the 30gb just fine and the wall charger works well. I haven't timed it, but I think it charges faster than USB. I haven't used the car charger yet, but I would assume it works just as well as the wall adapter. The only reason my rating was 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered the green skin for my green Zen Vision:M and the colors do not match exactly. I might have preferred the clear skin but besides the looks I am satisfied with everything else, very functional and the price can't be beat 
The chargers are your basic necessities and they work fine. The silicone skin is better than average protection but expect some adjustmens as to how you work the Zen. It impacts the Zen's sensitivity. 
Buying these items bundled saved a good deal of money and it's nice that the adapter is built into each cord. Priced individually, it's like the skin is free ($9.99 at Fry's). The vendor shipped right away and I received the package in two days 
I love my skin kit for my Creative Labs Zen Vision M!! For the money it's a great deal. The car charger and AC wall charger are adequate, though I wished the cords were longer. And the skin is awesome to protect the player and especially the screen. I bought my Zen, then immediately left for a Caribbean trip. It was fine on the beach and I didn't have to worry about sand invasion and scratching. I've also taken it into vapor caves and it's an awesome protector. The stand is a little wobbly, but works fine. I love my kit, especially because it's PURPLE!! ; - 
The skin fits well and both chargers work perfectly (so far!) Also, I was impressed with their extremely fast shipping. I ordered it on Friday and had it by Tuesday, with Monday being a postal holiday! Wow! The skin is more flexible than I expected, but it stays in place nicely while allowing all the controls to be used normally. The belt clip is a little weird, but I probably won't use it anyway. I really like not having to carry the Vision:M's dongle around to charge it, now I can leave the dongle with it's USB cable and not worry about losing it. An excellent deal 
I was thrilled to see that these gorgeous sandals were as beautiful as they looked on the website. They are also very comfortable and VERY inexpensive. What a delightful purchase 
I bought these shoes to go with a black dress I recently purchased. I hate having to get a new pair of shoes for one outfit but there was no way around it. I'm short but have a hard time with shoes with any kind of heels because my feet are fairly wide and somewhat flat. I'm usually of the mindset that you get what you pay for but in this case its not true! These shoes were not only inexpensive but extremely comfortable to wear and they're adorable! 
This attache case is perfect for my court appearances, when I go to court to take notes for my employer. It has plenty of room for my notes and court documents, a small bottle of water, my personal identification, car keys, cell phone, camera, etc., etc. I could not be happier than I am with this purchase, and, besides that, the case is far easier to carry than a purse, because I can put all I need to carry right inside. Thanks a lot for a great attache case 
This is a great gag gift for Helicopter pilots, I enjoyed giving it. 
They fit well and have a good amount of space for growth. My daughter likes them and they were reasonably priced. A good value all around 
The hunt was on for comfortable shoes for my two boys as they began to learn how to walk. They have been barefoot or in socks for their entire lives up to this point and it was important to me that their first shoes be a tolerable and enjoyable experience for them. While the price is what initially attracted me to these shoes, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were constructed in a sturdy manner. There was no shoddy workmanship on these shoes. The soles were solidly attached to the body of the shoes. The velcro closure to the shoes is much appreciated as I did not want to waste time with lacing up shoes that could easily be untied. On a cosmetic level, the colors of the shoes were nice and neutral while still leaning towards boy's colors. I bought several of these in different sizes so that my boys will have comfortable shoes to wear as they grow. How nice it is to just reach up in the closet for the next size shoe! I would not hesitate to recommend these shoes to other parents. 
I really like the shoes, they are very cute. The only downside is the velcro. The velcro is thin so after shoe is worn for awhile the strap starts losing its stickines 
We were unable to get these on my little one's feet. They could have been marked wrong but they are not the size mentioned. Love the shoes anyway 
These are really good shoes. My 3yo is getting great use of them. They are perfect cause he can put them on himself. Holding up wel 
Very good shoe. Easy for a child to put on with no shoestings to tie 
these are great for the diego fan in your house, my son loves them and wants to wear them all the time 
I LOVE these shoes. I actually find them to be confrontable, but i wear heels everyday. They are a pretty color brown and are so fun! I wish they were available in more colors, because i would buy every pair! They fit me true to size 
I always do this.. give Steve Madden shoes a chance, when I know for a FACT that no matter what shoe I buy (sneakers excluded.. I love SM sneakers) they will definitely be unbearably uncomfortable. These shoes pinch my feet in an area that NO OTHER SHOE I'VE EVER WORN has pinched me before. I'd return them in a second if I didn't have to pay shipping... now I'll just have to sell them. Plus, the material is subpar -- thin and of cheap feeling quality. I tell myself this every time, but I am never buying Steve Madden shoes again
