This all-Spanish handbook for parents with new babies will prove essential for any concerned about a child's health. Manual Pediatrico appeared first in English; the Spanish edition provides essential health information at a glance for parents unversed in medical care; and should be a mainstay of any Spanish-speaking home with children 
McCarthy's writing and portrayal of Lester Ballard, a necrophiliac, is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape. And then you have to wonder...why am I siding with a necrophiliac of all people? The writing is up to the high standards expected of McCarthy, and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche. The book has an interesting twist to the plot - Ballard is falsely accused of rape, his house is auctioned off and he's left as a social outcast, an animal. He is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal. If you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read 
Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you. I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book. The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
I was initiated into the world of Cormac McCarthy with this novel in Southern Lit class. My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I. This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner. It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point. There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned. There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard. There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying. However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor. McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about. The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts. This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read. It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to 
I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was "WE SELL THE EARTH." C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community 
There is no denying the strain of Faulkner that runs through McCarthy's early works; like his predecessor, McCarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place (here, the hills of Eastern Tennessee) interact. But McCarthy is more fun to read; his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind's eye. He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms. "Child of God" is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose. But that is one of the great joys of Cormac McCarthy's early novels--they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of beautifully painted landscape and haunting, nightmarish imagery 
I have read sevral of McCarthy's other novels. His best ones stretch something to the limit. In &lt;Blood Meridian&gt; it was violence. Here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings. Lester Ballard is the ultimate user. Other people exist for him only to meet his needs, even if they are dead. I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach. Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic. Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away. The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester. Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book. I don't think the title is meant to be ironic. I think we are meant to see that even Lester Ballard really is a child of God 
This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs 
If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association. It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like "is the kennel business for me?" and "what are the main issues in kennel management?" Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US. For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag 
"Ha ha ha hah ha hah!" That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank. Or at least I hope that's what he is doing. But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down. Quick! Stop me! I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron! The genre requires we make a leap of faith. And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly. But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel. But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all. But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense! My recommendation? Read the book. Laugh a bit. Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for 
The Protector's War (2005) is the second Alternate History novel in the Change series, following Dies the Fire. In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee. They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction. Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders. In this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring. The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings. Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons. When the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door. They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room. Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers. When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway. Nigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen. She bleeds out as her husband holds her. At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window. The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside. At Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder; as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list. Lord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change. The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value; the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure. Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change. It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct; someone or something has imposed the Change upon them. In McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort. This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete. Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack. This story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War. Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away. The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster. Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy: self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness. All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond. BTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic? It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean? Highly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance. -Arthur W. Jordi 
I loved Stirling's "Islands in the Sea of Time" trilogy, and I also loved the first book in this series. Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL. It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters. This book is a major disappointment. Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters. It comes across as simply ludicrous. The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters. This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing 
It completely sucked. Very long with nothing to say. Author was proud of his own knowledge of the SCA and Wiccans, and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development. What's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters. I now live overseas, so I bought a bunch of books in the "4 for 3" price discount section in order to save money. This is the first one I read of the received books. If they're all this bad, I'll be avoiding that discount database in the future 
I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like "what just happened!". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense. Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages. There seem to be no faults in the utopian "good guys" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes. Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story. The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional "Clans". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense. But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing: What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story. That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer. I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it 
Yet another fine effort from Stirling. The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again. A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed. The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels. I found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops. No spoilers, so I won't elaborate other than to suggest "Gathers the Storm" or somthing similar might have ben a better title. Hopefully "A Meeting at Corvallis" will be equally entertaining 
Mr. Stirling has succeded again. Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read. Honestly, I don't know where to start when explaining how good it is, so I will let you know the one thing I found highly disappointing about it, in one word: Wicca. That's right, Mr. Sterling has filled this book with so much "blessed be's" and "Lord and Lady" junk that you have to actually wade around that gobbledeegook to get to the real story. In fact, if it weren't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I'd have given this book two, maybe three stars. Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here. Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism/Islam in Africa, Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism/Shintoism/Anamism in Asia, etc. But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the "Lord and Lady" actually interact with some of the characters. Yet the characters don't sit there and think to themselves, "Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!" Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind. Oh, well. My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum. We don't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let's try to keep to a minimum the "blessed be's" or "lord and lady" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay 
While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook. I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library. 
Read this book! I never thought a history book would be one I could not put down. It's enlightening and eye-opening. It's a broad, fascinating history. 
Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's "American Colonies" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do. This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution. Among the Revolution's motives were "liberty" (a better form of government than that provided by London) and "empire" (eliminating British barriers to the colonies' territorial expansion). Since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists' territorial expansion, giving them a larger role in the history, as Taylor does, makes the history read more in the "imperial" vein. See chapter 18, "Imperial Wars and Crisis: 1739-75." In an important way, the "liberty" and "empire" motives both came down to land. The colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average Briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples. Jefferson summed up their objective as "an empire of liberty," which Taylor uses as chapter 18's final section heading 
The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted. This is one of those times when I wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend 
Has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative well-written text by a good historian. That is, unless your car won't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following Monday two days before Christmas. In that scenario, his good-historian-ness flies out the window and you just hate his guts. Taylor: Not all of us come from big money! Sorry my 80s model car exploded and inconvenienced you so! Thanks for ruining my gpa! Good book though 
I found this book well researched and full of information I knew nothing about. Taylor doesn't pull any punches when discussing our European ancestors and their brutality towards the native americans they helped destroy. Fascinating reading for anyone interested in our early history 
We all learned the basics of colonial history in school: the Mayflower; Jamestown; Tobacco; the development of New Amsterdam, Boston, Charleston, Philadelphia; indentured servants; and French trappers / Spanish Conquistadores. However, most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760. Moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and Indians. Despite being an American History buff, it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that I realized how little I knew. Taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the Spanish, French, English, Swedish, Dutch, German, etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the United States. There are plenty of fascinating details about exploration, the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies. More importantly, this book provides a solid background for why the English-speaking colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period. A well-written and well-researched book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about. This is history that is hard to put down 
Traditionally, coverage of "colonial America" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage. Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants. His scope is impressive. After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region. The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries. Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa. Taylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though. Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development. The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today. As the first book in the "Penguin History of the United States," Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes. By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come 
Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done 
Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s. Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States. A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied. Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests. And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well. The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book. Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution. For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations. And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans. 
The above is my favorite book and SLB conjured up similar emotions in me. I read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter's "must read" pile when she is ready for it. This is one of those books that, when you read it, it forever changes your life. Atleast it did for me...the same way TKAM changed me and has stayed with me. I highly recommend this book 
The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy. I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested. Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable 
I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books. The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing. I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia. You fall right in love with the charicters. This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love. It is such a dynamic story with suspense. I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone 
A wonderful, gentle, informative coming of age story. And the reader was a pleasure to listen to 
This book really great. I enjoyed the story immensley. Character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized. I really could picture myself at the "flamingo pink" house in Tiburon. The main character, Lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across, but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother. The group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life, love, faith and understanding. It's very heartfelt 
One of the best books ever!!!! I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over. I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair. Different genre, but also very entertaining! I have become an overnight, true fan of this author 
Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen. When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out). On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county. Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father. While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside. A very good read 
The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to. Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era. It was wonderfully told and beautifully written. 
Over the years I have read many books on the Red Scare in Hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism. This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films. In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists. In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party. This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist. And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings. But this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as right-wing Republicans. While I am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left, I find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias. The significance of this book to me from reading Ring Lardner's famous "I'd Hate Myself in the Morning" to watching Woody Allen's "The Front" and FINALLY getting a closing answer is overwhelming. I no longer feel the need to explore why Americans chose to follow another government's agenda to the potential detriment of our country. However, I do not fault these people for their initial attraction to communism and frankly, I don't view communism as wrong: it's just a different government method some choose. For myself, I remain quite satisfied with democracy, EVEN in these trying times. Rather, the attraction to communism was clearly a byproduct of the recent depression as well as the growth of fascism. I can live with that reasoning. This is an exceptional book if you have any interest in the 50s, movies, or communism. In closing, I must comment on the complete disrespect shown to Elia Kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when Nick Nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award. I suggest they read this book. The Red Scare was a horrible period but Freedom of Speech needs only go so far when supporting a government with intent to overthrow our own. I strongly recommend this book. 
While George Clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his "community" are proudly out of touch with mainstream America, I was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by Ronald and Allis Radosh. For readers with an interest in the context of the culture-clash between the "Hollywood elite" and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and DVDs, this book is an excellent resource. I say the "context" of the clash because this is a look at history, and a serious research work too. This is not a book that details the fashionable Leftist obsessions of Clooney, Streisand, Penn, and the rest, and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly. Instead, "Red Star Over Hollywood" digs deep into something far more serious and sinister ("sinister" comes from the Latin word for "left," by the way): the film colony's infiltration by agents of the Comintern, dedicated partisans of Stalin, and other actors, directors, writers, and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the United States. As Clooney's speech -- and even more so, his movie -- make clear, modern Hollywood's sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against "McCarthyism" and the blacklist (that's what makes Clooney's self-congratulation so laughable -- does anyone in Hollywood *defend* McCarthy?). But the Radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence (in other words, the witch-hunt turned up real witches), but that there was also a strong and active anti-communist Left in Hollywood. Even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in Hollywood, it was this anti-communist Left that was in the most direct conflict with the Stalinists, their apologists, and their dupes, particularly before and during World War II. All of this is important information, but it's when they turn to their discussion of HUAC and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront Hollywood's defining myth. Far from the usual pop-psychology analysis of the deranged and sweaty McCarthy (and why do so few people seem to notice that *Senator* Joe McCarthy had nothing to do with the *House* Committee on Un-American Activities?) the authors have gone in-depth in committee records, and also into the backgrounds of the people from Hollywood who came before the committee. It's certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of McCarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents. Ronald and Allis Radosh are to be commended for doing the latter. It's because this book is so heavily researched -- so filled with names, dates, and places -- that I note again that it may not be to everyone's taste. It is, I repeat, a work of history. It notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of, say, an Ann Coulter book, and so doesn't have the fist-pumping, take-that-you-commie excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works. But those books seem to disappear as soon as they fall off the bestseller lists. This, on the other hand, is a book that deserves to be around for a long, long time 
Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's "Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left." Talk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves. The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true "United Frontism" and "Popular Front" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed "revisionist" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like "Mission to Moscow," "The Spanish Earth," and "The North Star." Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views. I enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. "Red Star Over Hollywood" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life. So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat. I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another "we were innocent" propaganda piece. 
I have always been curious about the influence of Communism in Hollywood. This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it. It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated. It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation. I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful. The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions. Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union. It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union. Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors. Finally, the Radoshes put the "Hollywood Ten" and the blacklist years in perspective. They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated. I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost. It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed. Who said you can't win for losing! 
This book touches on one of the touchiest and nerve-wracked controversies of the last sixty years. Precisely because of a tendency to close ranks around the defense of semi-myths one needs to zero in from two angles. Here we get the clear effort to indulge in what many would think revisionist propaganda. But despite an obvious bias built in to the account, the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know, but might not, after the shouting matches over McCarthyism. I really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction, but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading. Conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business, but you can read around the lurid conservative passages (not so bad) for some useful corrections of the record, and no doubt much left out. 
It's no secret that many of Hollywood's and the entertainment businesss's current "stars" are socialist afficienados (or worse), but where did this denationalized elitism come from? "Red Star Over Hollywood" does a spectacular job at laying out the groundwork and background of the Hollywood political left, Communists and fellow travelers from the 1930's to 1950's. With about 37 pages of reference material (diaries, speeches, Congressional testimony, biographies, autobiographies, news articles, interviews, etc.), the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the Soviet Union in its attempts to "take over" Hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a Soviet America. The names of the actors, screen writers, producers etc who were card carrying Communists, fellow travelers, quislings, leftists, and varieties of socialists who made up the Hollywood scene in those days will floor you. You'll have to read the book to find out who they were. And there were many heroes as well, who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs. You'll never watch movies on the Turner Classic Movies channel the same way again. After you read the book, look closely at the writing and producing credits on these old films. The authors draw some connections between the Hollywood leftists of that era and the current crop of leftists in the "entertainment industry" today. But that comes at the end of the book and is a very brief section. This is a must read book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the Hollywood of the 30's-50's and who here's the sophist leftist pontifications of the Tim Robbins, Barbra Streisands, Bill Mahrs and others. One thing that will strike you is how well educated, thoughful, well read and articulate both the left and the right were in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. There was intelligent discourse on all sides. They make today's left and right apologists seem like 3d graders reciting "Dick and Jane" from memory. That insight was worth the price of the book. Gar 
I used to wonder why Hollywood ignored the crimes of Soviet Communism, which easily rival the crimes of National Socialism, something they've shown us over and over and over again (certainly understandable). Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin's "Red Terror," the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin's purges of the late 30's, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on "McCarthyism" and the ghastly "blacklist." They're listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don't believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that's no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over "McCarthyism," the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn't have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps! The Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30's and 40's was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin's mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin's secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin's killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the "horrors" of "McCarthyism." While no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her "hero" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see "Mao: The Unknown Story" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood "useful idiots" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet's crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of "The Motorcycle Diaries," a saintly portrayal of Castro's chief executioner Ernesto "Che" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of "counter-revolutionaries" at La Cabana prison, something that's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro. The negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can't refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts. Hollywood was filled with Stalin-worshipping Reds (now Castro-worshipping Pinkos), the Rosenberg's were guilty as charged and Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy. Truth hurts - deal with it!

The McCarthy era is generally portrayed as one of the darkest times in American history, and those who faced blacklisting in Hollywood have been lauded as heroes. Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party. The Radoshes describe the infatuation of "the Hollywood Party" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union. They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the "Hollywood Ten" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the "Ten" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work. The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, "Mission to Moscow." This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin's purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed. Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either "named names" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names. For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration. If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony's long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book. In the meantime, "Red Star Over Hollywood" is well worth reading. 
The back lash continues against the media strangle-hold on revisionist history. How many times have you watched a documentary or a movie that exhonerates those poor persecuted innocents, dubbed the Hollywood Ten, as sitting targets seated before an array of mean and ruthless right-wing zealots - the HUAC committee of the late 1940's and early 50's? Over and over and over it seems, doesn't it? Well now we have a detailed and painstakingly written rejoinder, "Red Star Over Hollywood", which tells the real tale; that these were mostly hard core members of the communist party USA, who took their marching orders directly from the Kremlin. They were Stalin's men and, not to put to fine a point on it, useful idiots in his quest to foment a world-wide communist revolution. Ron Radosh, a communist from childhood, smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the Rosenberg's only to find that .... they were guilty! After he said so he was unceremoniously drummed out of the "leftist corp" and made to wear a political scarlet letter by his former comrades....some friends they. Radosh is a PhD in History and a diligent, detailed researcher of the facts i.e. he's interested in the truth and in that sense wherever the facts lead him he will go. Unfortunately, one doesn't find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians, archeologists, political scientists, reporters, book publishers or video media types. As an aside, I found it interesting to compare this book with Neil gabler's, "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jew's Invented Hollywood." The nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a world-wide communistic revolution? Is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism? I don't know, but I for one would encourage Radosh to address the subject. And, he's the man to do it (another book to read as a companion peace would be "Intellectuals" by Paul Johnson, the author of "Modern Times.") It's important to recognize that not all of those in Hollywood, whose lives were ruined by HUAC, were hard-core communists. Some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices. To the readers benefit, Radosh teases out these nuances rather well, and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest. Setting the record straight is important, but the Hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a "fable of innocence destroyed by malice." It's their shakey attempt at moral authority, the kind that underpins a Sean Penn in his critique of Bush's Iraq policy, while he ignores the evils of Sadaam Hussein. This book challenges the template of the Hollywood left: that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against right-wing bullies leading a witch hunt against "un-American activities;" that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers. Read it, it's good. 
Written for Training Professionals, this book will help you to launch a corporate university, run it like a business using appropriate financial models, use the corporate university to strategically advance your organization, deploy effective technological resources and measure the ROI of corporate university activities. In the world of Training and Development, this book is thorough, well organized and insightful. This book is written for a general audience and supplies a thorough overview of the subject. Allen knows that corporate leaders want to know what impact corporate universities will have on the bottom line, and what value the corporate university adds to the organization. Creating this link between learning and results, requires managers to identify their problems and needs, analyze employee performance, determine performance drivers, and then create corporate university programs that can directly improve identified problems and meet specific needs. The Corporate University Handbook provides practical guidance and proven best practices 
Published in 2002, The Corporate University Handbook is now considered required reading for anyone who has been charged with establishing or administering a corporate university. Edited by Mark Allen, the handbook features the latest thinking from leading practitioners concerning best practices for establishing and administering a successful 21st century corporate university. No matter how overloaded your bookcase is, throw something out to make room for this invaluable "how to" handbook 
Once upon a time in the halls of academia, being a college graduate was enough. But now, corporations need their employees to have a more intense, ongoing academic and technical education, so they provide it themselves via corporate universities. Mark Allen and other experts from ten corporate universities, academic institutions and consultancies contributed chapters to The Corporate University Handbook, a practical, behind-the-scenes manual about designing and managing a corporate university. The goal goes beyond education: corporate universities must train employees and help corporations excel and prosper. This thorough, yet conversational, examination includes best practices, source notes and programs offered by specific companies including Motorola, Toyota, Sun Microsystems and Charles Schwab, in the U.S. and elsewhere. We from getAbstract assign this insightful book as an authoritative homework seminar for corporate university planners or managers 
Because I don't get TV One and have only seen the show a few times, I was pleasantly suprised when I saw this cookbook today in the store. I recommend it a MILLION TIMES over instead of Mo'Nique's, especially since she got some of her recipes from him!!! A GREAT way to get a taste of what's in store for you if you buy this book is to to go the show's website. Many recipes are there, but nothing beats having a book that you can carry with you. Some of these will be making their debut at the Thanksgiving table next week and I can't wait! There are some beautiful photos but not a whole lot, but that doesn't take away from the book too much because you can view many of them on the site. Highly recommended. I wanna have backbreaking sex with G. Garvin. Thanks for letting me share 
My husband and I have been waiting for this book since we first saw G. Garvin on TVOne. Needless to say, I am pleased with this book. The layout and directions are clear and concise. The entire book is not in color, but I can deal with that. Here's the table of contents: *Super Simple *Family Style *Market Fresh *Good Food Made at Home *Building a Great Dish *Cognac, Sticks and Steaks *Entertaining with G *Sweet Thoughts *Index My one criticism is that I wish a hardback edition of this book was available 
excellent book. the recipes i have tried are excellent. i like pictures too but content and recipe outcome are more important to me. i would highly recommend this as a new purchase 
I am a big fan of N. Sparks and enjoyed this book as I do all of his books 
Sparks continues to make his readers feel. I hope he continues to write for a long time 
I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels. After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue." Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc., 
I absolutely Love all of Nicholas Sparks' books. I have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you. Get your kleenex's ready. You can't go wrong here. And I always preorder his new ones..... I'm addicted 
I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them 
I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October 
I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me. It was a very very slow start. I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot. I had even considered quitting reading it at times. It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading. What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were. I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read. 
I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked. And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like. If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all. I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah 
The above is my favorite book and SLB conjured up similar emotions in me. I read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter's "must read" pile when she is ready for it. This is one of those books that, when you read it, it forever changes your life. Atleast it did for me...the same way TKAM changed me and has stayed with me. I highly recommend this book 
The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy. I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested. Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable 
I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books. The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing. I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia. You fall right in love with the charicters. This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love. It is such a dynamic story with suspense. I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone 
A wonderful, gentle, informative coming of age story. And the reader was a pleasure to listen to 
This book really great. I enjoyed the story immensley. Character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized. I really could picture myself at the "flamingo pink" house in Tiburon. The main character, Lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across, but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother. The group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life, love, faith and understanding. It's very heartfelt 
One of the best books ever!!!! I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over. I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair. Different genre, but also very entertaining! I have become an overnight, true fan of this author 
Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen. When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out). On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county. Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father. While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside. A very good read 
The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to. Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era. It was wonderfully told and beautifully written. 
The Messenger by Daniel Silva is just as interesting, exciting, and intriguing as every other Gabriel Allon book has been. I was hooked on page one and had a hard time putting it down until I reached the last page. My only regret is that more of the story is not set in Venice, my favorite city. There is just enough of a parallel to characters and events in the real world to make the stories plausible and just enough romance and action to make it gripping and absorbing. I am already looking forward to the next Gabriel Allon story 
well, imho, not as great as the other books in the allon series, but well worth the read! i'm looking forward to the next in the series. 
Very pleased with the price and speedy delievery and quality of the product. 
In this novel we have the characters we have come to love. The writing is tighter and the plot clear. Not quite as exciting or fresh. Some further development with Leah happens which I won't reveal 
A caveat to all Westerners who may think our most sacrosanct values are protected. Silva reaches into inner space to warn us of the dedicated nature of the enemy. If this is fiction, it is well dressed as a wake-up call to its readers 
I'am unable to get this message to anyone. This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad. This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me. I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player. I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
Daniel Silva has taken his protaganist right onto the front pages of the worlds' newspapers with his best work to date 
This is a timely, well written and exciting book. I enjoyed reading it. 
Love Silva's characters and plots. Only wish is for more, more, more 
I think this is a brilliant book. A great selection of interesting and relevant ideas on art, politics and technology. Beautiful images too and well published 
I read Bruner's book in one of my doctoral seminars which added a unique perspective on curriculums in early childhood education; however, journeying into the book and determining the main points of argument will challenge due to Bruner's overly dense prose. He highlights the idea of culture defining curriculum through its langauge, customs, history, and society status, but he fails to offer examples accessible to the classroom teacher. I would recognize this book as a added addition to to any Early Childhood Professional's library, but please prepare yourself for many re-reads 
This is, by far, the worst book I have EVER been forced to read. One star is too much. The title of this book, "The culture of education" leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education. He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. "Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection." What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as "immutable," Pontogenetically," and "Hermeneutic." If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell 
This book is a gift for readers. Maybe not all readers, but those who are genuinely interested in human values and culture. Bruners ideas are bright and deep, making us understand that the future of education depends on human beings as agents of their destiny. The importance of every cultures history and the transmission of experiences is only possible through human interactions. We cannot be naive and think that technology is not an instrument of culture. It is, and we must acknowledge it, otherwise we will be overridden by it. But, education is only possible by means of intersubjective exchanges: they are the key to the development of human beings 
I don't know about you, but sometimes I stumble upon a book that is a salve to my soul; I am not happy about one thing or another, and I need someone to talk to, talk at, or listen to--I need to look into someone else's life so that I can feel human again and not totally strange and alone. Nora Ephron's HEARTBURN did that for me, and for that I will put it on my bookshelf, along with the many books that have served the same purpose. On my second reading I could not remember if the story was based on the author's life. I was afraid that I might not enjoy it if it was pure fiction. I was wrong. The book is a very, very funny satire of the Washington scene, whch has not changed. It is also a tale of real angst and heartbreak. What is basically a sad story has delicious veins of humor, wistfulness, sadness, prosaic pragmatism, and real recipes marbling through it, all of which magically meld into a satisfying whole: but that is what a work of art can do. 
Every year or so I re-read "Heartburn," one of my favorite novels of all time. It is fall-on-the-floor-funny, and possibly the best and most memorable form of revenge that a spurned wife ever had. Today's re-reading of "Heartburn" was inspired by the revelation that Mark Felt is the real name of Deep Throat, the former FBI mole who fed Watergate information to Ephron's former husband, Carl Bernstein. In this roman a clef, the chatacter based on cheating-husband Bernstein is called "Mark Feldman." Today I read Ephron's admission, in the Huffington Post blog, that living with the knowledge of Deep Throat's true identity was a "very heavy burden." So, was her estranged husband's character name inspired consciously by Deep Throat's name, or subconsciously? I don't really need an answer to that question. However, it does prove that the novels we love are gifts that keep on giving. Thanks, Nora. Thanks, Mr. Felt--for everything 
If I had it to do over again, I would have made a different kind of pie. The pie I threw at Mark made a terrific mess, but a blueberry pie would have been even better, since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer.......so Rachel Samstat muses on her marriage to Mark Feldman. Nora Ephron's thinly disguised account of her marriage to famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein is laugh-out-loud funny in parts, though if you're looking for advice on how to save your marriage, the aforementioned tidbit is typical of the advice you'll get. Rachel is seven months pregnant with her second child when she learns her husband is not only having an affair with a mutual acquaintance, but has fallen in love with her. This indignity is compounded because, due to Rachel's advanced preganancy, she can't even date. She does manage one innocent flirtation on the subway which, in true slapstick fashion, leads to armed robbery. Ah, the perils of life flitting between New York and Washington. Short and savvy, this contemporary 80's novel is peppered with recipes since Rachel is a cookbook editor and host of her own cooking show. A collapsing marriage doesn't seem suitable for high-level comedy, but Nora Ephron makes it work and will have you laughing all the way to the bitter end. 
This book took a little getting used to (This was my first of reading books with recipes within the storylines) , but once I did... boy did I laugh! Great story along with recipes. Who couldn't beat a book that was funny, witty, and full of recipes!! A great read for anyone whom wants to curl up with a good book 
I didn't like this book. Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago. The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good. I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does. Bummer 
Nora crafted one of my all-time favorite books. Why I picked up a paperback copy as a freshmen in high school is beyond me. Why I finally got around to reading it at 18 is also a mystery. Why I've reread it more times that my dogged copy can tell is no mystery meat; sadness steeped in life's tea. In real life, I've played the part of the toddler in this tale. Wish I could say my folks were class acts, such as the author and her former spouse, but chicken fried steak is more common in middle America than Lillian Hellman's Pot Roast. --Laurel82 
This is one of contemporary fictions first books. It was written in the early eighties before Bridget Jones became a household name. It is a thoughtful novel about the breakup of a marriage. It is a quick read, but its not an earth-shattering premise. I recommend it for the beach or the bathtub 
Now that our democratic system has been eroded almost to the point of no repair, perhaps we should read books like this one to refresh our minds about what this country has always stood for. 
I am unfortunately not suprised by any of the revelations in this book. It seems that the vast majority of Americans simply do not care what kind of scumbags claim to "represent" us. Unfortunately, I do not own a multibillion dollar corporation, so I suppose I do not deserve representation. Hey, didn't the Declaration of Independence say something about people not being represented properly? Oh, pardon me, I have mentioned America's TRUE patriotic roots. God forbid anyone not agree with Dick Bush's neo-Nazi (or is that neo- conservative? It's hard to tell.) version of patriotism. Anyhow, I'll save a seat for you other treasonous free thinkers in the prison camp, or Hell. We all know that those are the only two suitable places for those who do not agree with the "decider" 
This book is a terrific volume for understanding what's gone wrong in America over the past 30 years. Unlike many best-selling authors, who spout only uninformed opinions and vitriolic ones at that, this guy actually does substantive research on his issues and helps us understand the deeper context behind them: the history, the players, their connections to other folks. What good is that you'll learn how much of our world is being controlled/destroyed by people and regulations that you've never even hear of or about. If everyone read this book and spoke up, we might actually preserve this democracy and live better lives. We'd understand what in our democracy and world is going wrong and have some ideas as to how to fix this. 
Actually, you can't according to Greg Palast who challenges the results of the 2000 election in which he charges Jeb Bush with instituting his own style of Jim Crow laws to ensure that his brother would get elected. It's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that Bush would have won anyway. Palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up. But Palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote, and the votes that were not counted. He charges that more than 57,000 law-abiding citizens were improperly labeled as felons, and were kept from voting in Florida. These were almost all African-American who universally vote Democrat. There was an 80% criteria for finding a match of felon names. The company Choice Point started with a 90% match, but the state told them that was too high! They were told to make it an 80% match. So, a felon named John Johnson Jr. would also keep a law-abiding citizen named Jack Johnson or John O. Johnson from voting too. When did the state of Florida inform these people that they were on a felons list and could not vote? They didn't, even though they were supposed to give ample notice to allow any mistake to be corrected. The company that got the job of putting the fix in, Choice Point was awarded a multi-million dollar contract over other companies that would have done the same job better for literally pennnies per voter. Florida decided to pay much more per voter with Choice Point. Now here's the lie. Choice Point said that they did not use race as a criterion, but it was used as a matching criterion. Presto! Even with the disproportionate number of Blacks in the prison population, Palasts states that the number kept from voting was statistically way out of proportion to the number of felons. Just to ensure the outcome, the voting machines in Black neighborhoods were fewer and older than the ones in White neighborhoods. In some cases 18% of the Black vote was thrown out for one reason or another while in White neighborhoods were 1 to 2% was the norm. This was the perfect scam since anyone knows that Blacks would overwhelmingly vote for Gore, and the Whites would have had a large voting block for Bush. Florida's official reason was that the law prohibited felons from voting. They didn't want any felons to try to vote. (?)Palast asks, what felon wants to vote so badly that he would risk going back to jail for it? Good point! Not one person in Florida was arrested for voting twice. Then, there were the roving republican goon squads who went to wherever the recount was attempted to intimidate the recount process. Palast accuses the press of doing nothing or investigating nothing about a national election that was obviously rigged. When he offered the story to CBS, a network that has long since cowed to conservative screams of bias, they refused. Why? The CBS executive called the state of Florida to verify the story. They, the state, assured them there was nothing to it? Isn't that like asking the fox if he can be trusted to protect the henhouse? Palast gained a large audience in Europe bringing this story to light. It received almost no attention here, and when it did, it was way after the election. This was the most important part of the book for me. While I enjoyed his commentary on Wackenhut and other exposes, this one was the most riveting. It scares me. This isn't supposed to happen in the US. That is why I recommend this book and especially his newer one, "Armed Madhouse." Palast proves by showing leaked documents, pictures and statistic improbability that this and the 2004 election were stolen by electronic ballot stuffing. I thought this was only supposed to happen in a third world nation. Shouldn't someone go to jail for this? Shouldn't we be able to count on it 
I read this book in record time. Greg Palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government'. I am ashamed that our own US media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government. From Iran to Iran Contra to Iraq and the Oil fields, from the Halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm. Thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of ALL the people. AND HOW IMPORTANT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE FOURTH ESTATE is to your Democracy 
Palast bares it all. Put me through all 5 stages of mourning- from disbelief to anger to despair 
Greg Palast loves challenges.Bold and sarcastic. Now you can understand why emergent countries will always remain in the third world for the benefit of big corporations and corruptous politicians. Not surprising that all the info provided by Palast was never shown on the america's news. 
The first time I read this book it was because I'd heard an interview with the author on NPR and felt compelled to get the whole story. It's a fast, entertaining and SCARY read. Don't skip any parts if you can help it - it's not just about corporate and political corruption, it details (with evidence) how this world of ours works and what we need to keep our eyes open for when the bad guys get into our neighborhoods. The sections on what US corporations do in other countries is APPALLING. The sections on the country-destroying terms of IMF and World Bank loans is HORRIFYING. And, if you've ever wondered what the heck public utility privatization is all about, this explains it - AND IT'S UGLY 
Devour this book in small bites, or you're likely to choke on the raw truth of it. Between these covers, Palast demonstrates repeatedly why EVERYone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts. While I'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations, the policies and actions carried out by the Bush Administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of Palast's claims in broad daylight. If only the mainstream media were paying attention. Then again, the mainstream media is owned by corporations that make money selling fluff and not upsetting too many of their readers, viewers, and/or listeners. So why should we expect otherwise? Occasionally, Palast pushes the envelope on his ability to actually KNOW the motivations and responsibilities (blame) of various people he is writing about here. More often than not, however, he simply puts forth so many facts, and connects so many dots for us, that it's difficult to not come to many of the same conclusions he has. And, again, the actions of the Bush Administration -- and various members and associates of the Bush family -- have born out many of those conclusions over the past few years. Read this book and compare it with news stories from the past 5-to-6 years and, if you have done any digging at all, you will quickly see how scary the truth really can be. Hopefully, you'll also see how important it is now to stand up, speak out, and fight for genuine middle class America and those folks even less fortunate than us. One thing you can put money on, our current government sure isn't looking out for them...or you. Good luck to us all 
I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection. So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
THis book was horrible. If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have. I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend. I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire. One less copy in the world...don't waste your money. I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes. THis book wasted my life 
If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird. After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people. Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time. I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told. This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing. I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it. But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did. I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat. 
I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through 
This book is great. Augusten Burroughs is genius, and a great storyteller! I couldn't put it down 
Lula Cruz and her best gay friend, Jeff, embark on a trip to Miami just before College eats her time up. After a series of misfortune, they find themselves working for a somewhat Latin woman, Cece, in a Cuban cafe. SoBe's (South Beach) environment wasn't the only one that caught her attention---a guy named Enrique, a man who you could never go wrong, swooned her heart. But what if Enrique turns out to be her best competition later on? The first time I read the book, I got hooked with it. When I finished reading it, the book left me amused and it somehow satisfied me. What I didn't like in the book was its too predictable. However, because I was hooked in this book the first time I read it, it didn't show (as for me). However, though I enjoyed it, I wish the authors put some sense of "mystery and quality" in it---something that keeps the readers guessing until the very end 
Eighteen-year-old Lula Cruz is totally stoked about the road trip she'll be taking with her best friend, Jeff, the summer before she begins her studies at a University in Miami. She plans on checking out of hot, sweaty NYC, and diving right in to the cool waters that SoBe (South Beach) provides. However, the two friends are quickly realizing how hard it truly is to be out on their own, with no one there to support them. They get day jobs that totally run them down, and are, how should we put this...totally boring! So Lula and Jeff decide to spice things up by entering a local band contest that could get them televised and everything. The only problem, is that the newest hottie Lula's been hooking up with, Enrique, has also entered the band contest, and is her band's toughest competition. Sure, Enrique is totally mesmerizing to look at, but Lula's not sure if she can trust him with her secrets...or her heart. As a HUGE fan of the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series, I never pass up the opportunity to read their latest releases, which is why SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE quickly caught my eye. Suzanne Weyn Diana Gonzalez have created an excellent book for anyone looking for an easy read during their Spring Break or Summer Vacation. The characters found in SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE are upbeat, fun, and all feature unique personalities. The romance is cute, and will definitely appeal to pre-teen and teenage girls; while the band competition will appeal to aspiring musicians of the female gender. Overall, this was a wonderful addition to the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series, that will be enjoyed by all. Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
I love all the books in this "series" (Royally Jacked, Spin Control, Ripped at the Seams, etc.), and I couldn't wait to read SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE. SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE is about Lula Cruz and her best friend Jeff. They move from New York to South Beach, Florida the summer before they start college, and the trip is a bit of a disaster from the start. Lula is going to stay with her dad, and is planning on getting to know him better, and Jeff is going to be staying with his ultra-strict uncle. When both Jeff and Lula realize that they can't possibly stay where they are, the two of them decide that they have to find an apartment that's relatively cheap. Enter CeCe's Cuban Cafe, a small cafe in South Beach that isn't doing to well business-wise. There's an apartment over the restaurant, and the owner (CeCe) decides that Lula and Jeff can stay there if they offer to work in her restaurant. SOUTH BEACH SQUEEZE is a cute story about friendship, music, and romance. My favorite thing about the book was all the pop culture references, but it's overall a really enjoyable read. Overall grade - 
Then you will absolutely fall in love with this book. This book is full of images from a wide range of media and artists. The short bios on the artists are short but informative and don't take up much space (more room for pictures). If you're something of an artist yourself then you can certainly pull lots of ideas from this book. I definitely am glad I bought this book 
Not only the content is insightful, but the design of this book is just wonderful. It is a good source of international drawing's world and a good coffee table book. Get it now 
I am disappointed with the quality of the images. They are the quality of an ink jet printer set at draft quality. Most of the images are so faded it is difficult to see at all. I have returned this book, which is something I do once every 1000 books I order, and it is the first art book I have ever returned in my life. 
Beautifully bound and a pleasure to hold...what a book is all about vs the digital stuff. Two small niggles....first; the larger drafted works when reduced for the book become virtually unreadible (maybe they could have got a page each?) and second; the dust cover while beautiful and reflecting the texture and aesthetics of the book is virtually useless for it's purpose as it is too easily torn. I gave it 5 because I'm prejudiced 
It has many interesting works in the book. It is great to have it 
This is a book that when you first open it up and flip through a couple of pages you will be saying to yourself that you have to sit down with it for a long considered look. Myself, I just looked at the care that Phaidon press took while publishing this, from its rough artistic pages to the in-depth look at contemporary drawing and knew instantly that this was a survey book that I would be opening time and again for years to come. The artists that are covered here are not neccisarily unknown. Pettibon, Peyton, and other long standing luminaries stand along side scores of other artists that I had never heard of. What it is, is a survey of non-illustration/often conceptualy based drawing that is occuring today be the artist known or obscure. If you are into drawing, this is a must have book. One thing to keep in mind is that the format presented here is pretty much along the lines of Vitamin P and the three 'Cream' books. I think all four of these ranged from good to great, if you disagree with this sentiment, you might not like 'Vitamin D.' 
David Kennedy's "Freedom from Fear," the 9th volume of the Oxford History of the United States, is a generally exceptionally well researched history covering from the Great Depression to the end of World War II. In this book, Kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians, as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals. I believe most of David Kennedy's interpretations and judgments are well reasoned. However, I disagree with his deemphasis upon the major decline in the stock market between late 1929 - 1931 as one of the main causes of the Great Depression. Even more so I dissent very strongly with David Kennedy's suggestion the Roosevelt administration should have tried harder to avoid war with Japan by essentially appeasing Japanese aggression against China. To quote from his book, Kennedy writes on page 513: "Why not acquiesce, however complainingly, in the Japanese action in China, reopen at least limited trade with Japan..." Given the fact that Japanese aggression and atrocities in China were as bad or worse as Germany's in Europe by late 1941, I find Kennedy's opinion morally reprehensible. In general, this is a very good book, covering social, economic, political and military history of the era. However, don't read "Freedom from Fear," expecting to learn much about cultural history in the United States between the Great Depression and World War II. 
Freedom From Fear is an exhaustive study of America and its people during two of this country's most defining periods, the Great Depression and World War II. David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book. This period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life. The Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency. The New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely. The turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict. The major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war. This book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written. I've studied this period before, but I found this book very rewarding in that I also learned quite a bit I knew little or nothing about. I would highly recommend this book 
Despite the newfound popularity of social history, and ethnic history, and gender history, it's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice old-fashioned survey history of America. Heavy on political history, Freedom from Fear tells the story of America during the Great Depression and the Second World War. It is a survey, but it is broad and deep, running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years. David Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning text is worth every penny. Given the two broad subjects, it's not surprising that the book is essentially divided into two sections. In the first, Kennedy takes us on a journey into the downward spiral of the American economy during the Hoover years. Maligned by history, Hoover could have been a better president than he was, but events overwhelmed him. Even his great success in life prior to winning the White House did not prepare him for the immensity of the task. Indeed, possibly no one could have handled it. But Roosevelt is seen here to have been up to the challenge. Not of actually fixing the problems. Kennedy is quite frank in his evaluation of Roosevelt's New Deal programs and his performance in such matters. In many places Roosevelt could have done better, perhaps by adopting a more internationalist approach to economics, or by not antagonizing and demoralizing the business community. More broadly, we see the decline in living conditions, and at the same time the rise of labor unions and government programs both useful and not. We see the uneven performance of the economy in various parts of the country, and the desperate mobility that sometimes resulted. We see a country scared and in turmoil, unsure of itself and its destiny. But though the Depression dragged on, waxing and waning, events elsewhere in the world did not stop to wait. Though America was among the hardest hit of countries, it was not the worst behaving on the international scene. Rumbles of war began in Europe and in Asia, and America stood aside hoping to avoid it all. Of course this was not to be, and with the Japanese attack America found itself thrust into total war. The economy was finally freed of the doldrums by massive war spending. The people were roused from stupor by the drumbeats of battle. Alliances solidified, and the enemies were targeted. And America joined the war in its own unique way. It could never be said that America takes no advantage of its industrial strength. While the countries of Europe dealt with the situation forced upon them, America armed itself and prepped for battle. It built its forces. It provided machinery and equipment to allies. It transformed factories to a war production mode. Industrial geniuses, pumped with cash, streamlined methods of mass production on a scale never imagined before. And newer and better weapons came to be. More than in most books, Kennedy makes it clear that the American effort in war was a mechanized and deliberate effort. When the Western front opened, it was run with industrial clarity of purpose. If there is a dominant theme in Freedom From Fear, it is that America runs on its commerce. The business of America really is business. With or without government regulation, with or without organized labor, it is economy that runs Kennedy's America. But with such sweeping vision and engaging style, the reader could do much worse to learn about America in the interesting times than to read this gripping account 
There is much to like in David Kennedy's history of the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s. His book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period. His examination of the New Deal is both insightful and judicious, while his description of America in the Second World War is gripping and informative. Throughout the book Kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events, discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the American people and their government. Yet in some respects the volume is something of a disappointment. The book is a contribution to the superb "Oxford History of the United States" series, which has set a high standard with its earlier volumes. It is by this measure that Kennedy's book is wanting; it is hardly the comprehensive examination of its topic that the earlier volumes were, as his focus on politics and economics gives short shrift to American culture and society during the period. Moreover, his prose often seems excessively grandiose. Efforts to create soaring metaphors often become too labored and fall flat, making for a stark contrast with the clear descriptions and jargon-free analysis they buttress. Nevertheless, Kennedy's achievement with this book is impressive. He has provided a well-written account of America's efforts to deal with some of the greatest challenges that the nation ever faced. Readers seeking a history of the period would be hard pressed to find a better and more readable book with which to start 
With W. Bush preparing to undo the last vestiges of the New Deal, whether you agree with him or not I can't think of a better time, and reason for reading this remarkable study by David Kennedy. Kennedy debunks much of what the remnants of history have left most of us about Herbert Hoover. I think this was the most surprising part of the book because everything I had read, seen, or heard up until now left only negative impressions of the man. I have a both a new respect for Hoover as a man, dour though he was, and a clearer understanding of why he failed as a politician. I also have a fresh reminder of how nothing is really original - FDR borrowed much of the New Deal from Hoover. But where Hoover couldn't make the ideological leap from good ideas that were to be voluntary only with only minimal government assistance, FDR was amenable to trying anything, including transformational ideas such as mandatory business compliance with Federal regulation, an evening-up of the playing field between business (which had corporatized) and labor (which until FDR hadn't the power to do the same) and labor, to massive government spending. Although FDR didn't understand Keyensian economics, he nevertheless proved the theory. FDR defined the "general welfare" clause of the Constitution, and left a legacy that has affected every single one of us ever since, and continues to do so today. Beside the in-depth look at the Great Depression, Kennedy also provides a survey of WWII, debunking many more myths along the way, and exposing the beginnings of the cold war in FDR Churchill's unkept promises to Stalin about the opening of a second front in Europe. I consider this a "must read" for anyone who considers him/herself interested in American History 
This is a very literate and enjoyable history. It explains some of the greatest crises of Western Civilization and parades in all their glory heroes like FDR, Churchill, Truman, and Marshall, and it singles out others for less glowing treatment. Professor Kennedy's survey of the period from 1929 to the end of W.W.II is, in my view, the finest of those perilous times. Naturally, the Great Depression and World War II are too vast for any one volume, and if one has an interest in any specific topic, personage, or chapter, the author has provided an unrivalled bibliography to kick off the quest. The professor's writing is simple and straightforward and he knows how to keep his narrative moving at a good clip. This is essential in such a lengthy document. All in all, I'd classify it as a tour de force, essential reading for those interested in the Depression and the War. After the wonderfully enjoyable read, the book sits well on the shelf and comes down quickly for solid reference. This is definitely a five star effort.  
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The book is exactly what it says it is, a general history of the United Stated during the Depression and WWII. I found myself wanting to know more about many topics than author wrote. This should be expected though as the nature of a book of this type though is that some topics must be treated in a rather cursory manner or left out all together. The book does provide a vivid portrait of the era and of the events and personalities that shaped it. After reading it, I can see why it won the Pulitzer prize 
"Freedom From fear" by David Kennedy is a highly respectable history book for the Great Depression and WWII era. Professor Kennedy filled this book with lots of quality research, as well as his own opinions on the Great Depression. In the beginning of this book, Kennedy begins with Herbert Hoover and how he did things "wrong", but then he turned to FDR who kept up with the changing economy at that time. Kennedy portrays FDR as powerful and willing for change. He was an inspiring character for those during the Depression. Further into the book, Kennedy devotes his research to the New Deal and the effects it had on the Depression. Kennedy did go into detail about the effects, but he should have researched more about the causes of the Depression. Even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was Kennedy's writing style that made the book hard to put down. It was very enjoyable to read and we recommend it to any history lovers who want to learn more about the Depression 
Management new paradigms, strategy, the change leader, information challenges, knowledge worker productivity, managing oneself, Druker proved himself more than capable in his definitions and unique challenge to managers. Rather of a retrospective of his past work "he set aside to wirte not the known past but the unknown future". Peter Drucker discusses the profound social and economic changes occurring today and considers how management--not government or free markets--should address these new realities in the workplace. "Management is Business Management in all kind of organizations". This book is easy to read. For most content may be wider than how we think management usually is. Druker wrote in his introduction " the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century". Peter Drucker discusses how the new paradigms of management have change and will continue to change our basics assumptions and principles of management 
Drucker outlines lessons that management can learn from the changing world economy and population. 1. Management is not just business management, but is the ability to take advantage of opportunities in sectors of the economy that are likely to experience growth in the future, like education, the professions, and healthcare. 2. Recognize that there is not one ideal way to organize an enterprise. Both "team" organization and the "CEO cult of personality" have their shortcomings. It can be difficult for teams to make decisions effectively and popular CEO's must have successors. You must find the right balance of organization that fits your company's business needs. 3. There is no one way to organize employees. You need to lead workers rather than manage employees. This is because management increasingly does not know the areas of expertise that employees possess, and employees are now seeking interesting and rewarding work. 4. National boundaries and regional markets will become less defining factors of the companies boundaries. Innovations in an industry don't necessarily come from within the industry anymore. Further, national governments will be less able to protect local industries from facing the competitiveness of the global industry leaders. Global competitiveness must become a strategic goal for the business. Drucker also outlines the economic consequences of the declining birthrate in the developed countries. A declining birthrate means that the working population will become progressively older. New relationships must be forged with older workers, especially knowledge workers. Companies that attract and retain knowledge workers past retirement age will gain a significant competitive advantage. Managers must become Change Leaders, who direct inevitable change in a controlled and orderly fashion. Managers must look to extending the lifespan of their companies and approaching change as a source of business opportunity. 
Peter Drucker, an editorial columnist for the Wall Street Journal, a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world's most respected management thinkers. His books, over 20 of them, have been called the "landmarks of the managerial profession" by the Harvard Business Review. He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought. In 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams.' In 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers' concept. Here Drucker lays out six of the 'new' challenges facing the businesses of the early 21st century. First involves management's new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people. There is no 'one size fits all' approach. The method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is 'value.' Employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers, 'persuaded' rather than 'ordered.' The next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape. The collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for. Global competitiveness is a must for survival. Performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just short-term gains in order to inspire and commit 'knowledge workers' to their mission. Third is becoming a change leader. Educate others that change equals opportunity. Regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results. Enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company. Study what is working or not in the market with other companies. Don't confuse motion with action. Fourth are the information challenges. The purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action. Success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer. Information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity, competence and allocation of scarce resources information. The fifth challenge lies in vitalizing 'knowledge workers' into high productivity. Attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow. Differing from manual laborers, knowledge workers carry the 'means of production' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work. The sixth challenge is managiing ourself (ourselves). The biggest possible increase in production lies here. Intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance. Concentrate on your strengths. Avoid trying to change yourself. Ask yourself what your strengths are. Determine how you work. Do you like to work alone? Would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker? What are your values? This type of questioning will help determine where you belong. Most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once. You must learn what makes 'you' tick. Five Stars 
This book is first published in 1999. Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc. The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages. The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is. It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations. It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century. Concepts like "individuals will outlive their organization", "how to defines one's goal and contribution" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES. I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD 
Regrettably, Peter Drucker passed away just a few days after I picked up this 1999 release. At the age of 89 (in 1999), Drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business. His chapter on "Information Challenges," at 38 pages one of the longest in the book, Drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data. Few companies exemplify this better than Wal-Mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain. Perhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer, Drucker recognized that "more and more people in the workforce - and most knowledge works - will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES." (Emphasis in original.) Drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives, something he himself did. As Drucker put it in his introduction, the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century. With this book, as with all of his others, Drucker may be gone physicially, but his thoughts will live on for many decades to come. Jerr

Drucker is a master at Business management and a great visionary, this book is a must for anyone planning for the future--CraigAdams.ne 
An experienced Author's presentation 'Management Challenges for the 21st Century' is a challenging and an inspiring Read. Since years, there has been drastic changes in social and economic levels. Management requires re-shaping the business strategies from time to time. Peter offers new paradigms of management with thoughtful implementations of strategic ideas to face the critical areas, weaker spots, problems, practises and how to face in the 21st century. Slightly for the genius minds, the book demands deep business sense and profound knowledge. Management needs to indepth recognising strengths and analysing on performance, clear goals on how to achieve quality work, motivation and getting quipped with innovation. Peter argues that management will increase the productivity of the knowledge worker and with the global competitiveness, he focus on re-definition of corporate performance. Peter offer lessons with the major chapters like 'Management's New Paradigms, Strategy, The New Certainties, The Change Leader, Information Challenges, Knowledge-Worker Productivity, and Managing Oneself for the new waves. In the chapter 'The Change Leader', he clearly motivates the leaders to be ahead of times by starving the problems and feeding opportunities. The uncertainties can be overcome with change in accepting new and abandoning old patterns of management and make an increase in productivity. The Knowledge worker chapter is to enhance productivity piloting to fresh new innovative ideas. Managing oneself is a thorough learning guide as Peter leaves no room in grooming the new age management leader. An Outstanding Book for Read n Digest especially to all generation next leaders and a Must Read for existing Management CEO's to cope up with the change - Change before the Change 
Harper Neeld's book is an incredibly detailed compilation of the author's personal experiences in the sudden loss of her young husband, interviews with other widows/widowers, and discussions of phases of the grieving process. I would rate this book highly, along with one of my favorite grief authors, thanatologist Alan Wolfelt (e.g. Understanding Your Grief books). Harper Neeld seamlessly combines her painful, personal story with factual, helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks I have read on widowhood. I used the introspective questions with my grief therapist, who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught. 
My friends keep telling me I should write a book about my grief, but I think that what Elizabeth Harper Neeld has written is better than anything I could produce. This book is so readable and covers every aspect of grief. My husband died four months ago, and I have found this book exceedingly helpful. Elixabeth put the most important step first "To experience and express grief fully." There are hundreds of ways to run away from grief, but it is necessary "to feel it to heal it." I was given the best advice by a friend who said to "lean into the pain." The second choice "To endure with patience," has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself. Thank you, Elizabeth for this beautiful book. I will buy it for everyone I know who loses someone dear 
After my husband died suddenly, I was beside myself. My aunt insisted on placing this book in my hands. It has been a lifeline to me. I have purchased well over 20 copies of it for friends and continue to haunt my local bookstore when they don't have it on the shelf for immediate purchase. Having read almost every grief book out there, don't waste your money, just buy this one and learn to live again. 
My husband of 1.5 years but my soul-mate of a lifetime passed away a year ago. I have read so many books of grief, but only Seven Choices helped me find hope. This book is an honest account of a difficult journey, and like all things that are done with honesty - it touches the core of who we are. 
I bought this book in audio for a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer after 44 years of marriage. The day it arrived, she listened to both tapes and said she could so identify with the author. She thanked me profusely for this gift and said she was going to listen to it in her car as she drove. Her husband has only been dead a month as of this writing, and neither of us expects her to "heal" in record time, but she found comfort in this book and made me so glad this is the one I chose to send her. Based on her comments, I strongly recommend it to the grieving, especially widows 
This is a great guide that I recommend to all of you who are looking for scholarships. Check this out thoroughly, and if you feel you're up to the total scholarship plus being paid for training that West Point offers, I recommend that you then go on to read "West Point: Character Leadership Education..." by Norman Thomas Remick to understand the importance of this college that is the best kept secret and the one that everyone has a good chance of getting into 
It covered a lot of ground. I feel like I got my money's worth 
Tobias writes a bible in personal financial investment without the lack of humor and personal touch. He is clear on investing principles he preaches, states his opinions precisely and still provide overviews of investments he believes are pure baloney. American investors would be thrilled that he goes indepth with certain investments and terms but international readers might skip 30% of this book that deals with investment products, policies and law regarding the subject in US 
This is the only investment book I can get my husband to read. I gave copies of the 1987 edition to my sons when they graduated from college and I am giving them the 2005 edition as they approach 40. Tobias has been consistent with his advice over the years. He does not promise to make you rich but he gives guidelines for ending up with a comfortable retirement; partly by getting one to acknowledge what one does not know. He helps create a saving mind set. His explanations are clear and useful even for more sohpsticated investors than I am. Plus I enjoy his sense of humor which makes for an enjoyable read 
I can honestly say this book changed my life by opening my eyes on how investing and money really work over the long term 
I have found the advice in this book to be invaluable. You simply can't go wrong. Those looking for a book with stock/mutual fund investing howtos should keep looking however. This is a broad brush stroke at handling one's money. Period. If you are going to read this book, be sure to read My Vast Fortune as well. The two tell quite a story and show that Mr Tobias is not just blowing air between his gums. This book is eminently readable and there is just not much wrong with it. Everything from what to do if you inherit wealth, to what type of life insurance to buy, to how to buy a car, to how to use the internet to save money on staying at a hotel are covered, as well as everything in between. Read this and prosper 
It's clear, easy to understand and remember. Also entertaining and insightful. 
First and foremost, Tobias has a keen sense of humor, which makes this book an enjoyment to read. In my opinion that is the most important thing because if a book is dull albeit with good advice, then you're probably not going to get much from it. The real-world examples and down-to-earth suggestions make this something for everyone, not just the wealthy. This was the first investment book that I had ever purchased. And although it isn't the only one I own, it's the one I refer to most often. I've never taken a business class, and my career is completely unrelated, but I needed something to help me plan my finances. I learned an extraordinary about from Tobias and I definitely feel confident going into the investment world. I've since began buying this book for my siblings as a college graduation gift. I think that you can't go wrong purchasing this item 
I enjoy Andrew Tobias' writings. He is witty, concise and intelligent. While I don't agree with all of his advice, most of his reasoning stands up. I also highly recommend Tyson's Investing for Dummies, Personal Finance for Dummies and Mutual Funds for DUmmies 
I read this book because of I thought it was going to be funny, and it was. But I was not expecting to learn anything new, having read several books on investing. So I got a pleasant surprise when I actually did learn something. I would say this would be a great first investment book to read. BTW, if you are looking for more humorous and worthwhile investment books (a rare thing) out there I would recommend "Where are the Customers' Yachts?" and "The Money Game 
The book, "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" is a gross misnomer. At best, the book should be entitled "A Good Personal Finance Guide". If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed. The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all. Way overstated with the title! 
Very enjoyable to watch TV from that era - no cell phones, vintage cars. The DVD is very good in terms of color, quality of sound, etc. However, I did encounter freezing at the beginning of an episode. Otherwise, I recommend this product 
I found this story sad but very good with nice ending. She suffers alot but I really enjoyed the ending 
Danielle Steele is a writer who wields the written word like an artist... using story lines that attract you by their sheer difference from what people experience in their own "tame" lives. Widowhood, single parenting, trauma, and grudging admiration make this story compelling...a tear jerker.... I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the talent of a successful story teller 
I like Danielle Steel and I'm happy becouse I don't need to go to the store to see what's new...I have a good friend "amazon.com".I'm very satisfied about all items I received.Whenever I need something," I look for my friend....I trust amazon.com and I'm very sorry I don't know much more English words to show you how well we get along each other...It's easy,fast,safe and be sure you'll never send back items received becouse they come faster than you believe and the best shape you've ever seen.Just go to amazon.com and you'll see!Dorina(I apologise for my mistakes that more than likely I made! 
This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
This is a story with a happy ending about Liz Sutherland, an attorney, who lost her husband by a gun shot wound. He was killed when a man shot him at their office when he ran an errand on Christmas day. The killer was an abusive and enraged husband of one of their clients. The Sutherlands were family law attorneys and defended domestic abuse cases. Liz and her 5 children grieved for the loss of their father for some time... Not long afterward, her oldest son was severely injured in a car accident. In the midst of her stress along with grief, she noticed a handsome emergency room physician who treated him. His name was Bill Webster, MD. He noticed her also. The two soon began to date... and they began to fall in love. However, problems arose with Liz's children because not all of them were ready to let go of their father's memory. They did not want to accept Bill. On Thanksgiving Day, when he was invited for dinner, her daughter insulted him. He decided to leave...Liz's heart was broken.. 
The beginning of the book was excellent and then it tapered off towards the end. The House on Hope St, has tones of her earlier and much superior book "Accident", which I highly recommend. Pick it up for a good read, but realize as soon as she enters the relationship with the doctor, everything is textbook romance 
This book is a predictable love story, what we've all come to love about Danielle Steel's books. Perhaps we'd like a bit more UNpredictability, but most of the time I enjoy the story anyway. Reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have, that's always a good thing. It also makes you think that if anything bad were to befall you, you could probably survive. This wasn't her best book, but I thought it was decent. If you want to read a really great love story by Steel, check out: The Ring, To Love Again, Summers End, Answered Prayers &amp; Passions Promise 
August Escoffier was known as "The king of chefs and the chef of kings". This book is indispensible to anyone who is serious about the culinary arts. Escoffier defined the benchmark for classic French cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots, much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music. You can find essences of classic French cooking in even the lowliest diner fare. Much of what is taught in culinary schools today is based on Escoffier's tecniques. By purchasing this book, you are getting this information straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak, rather than second-hand with the possibility of influences instilled by the instructor skewing the information. I believe the most surprising section of the book is that dealing with treatments for various types of game. This section contains comprehensive instructions for dealing with a wide variety of game from buffalo to venison that are very useful today. I have noticed in at least two places, Escoffier appears to contradict himself. I believe this is due to the problems with translation, and if you follow carefully what he is saying, you can figure out the correct meaning 
I am very annoyed that people who do not have any idea of what this book is, have the audacity to rate it. If you made the mistake of buying this book thinking it was a cookbook that is your own fault! Please don't rate Escoffiers culinary writings based on your own stupidity. As other reviewers have pointed out this is a reference guide or encyclopedia of French cooking and not a cookbook. The author assumes that you have more than basic knowledge of French cooking and has no glossy pretty pictures. It is complicated yet simple and an is indispensable guide for anybody that wishes to research classic French cooking. To give an example of how this book is arranged, if you wanted to prepare a Velout Alboufera, first you would have to know what a Velout is and how to prepare a basic Velout. Then you would follow the directions to prepare a Velout d' Ecrevisses and finish with a liaison of egg yolks butter and cream. If you don't know that a Velout is a type of soup, skip this book and please please for those of you that made the mistake of buying it, please don't rate it! 
It has been said that the true test of any work,whether it be a piece of art, music, or a book is the test of time. This volume has done just that! First written almost 100 years ago these recipes are just as relavent today as they were in Escoffier's time. Please be aware that this book is not for the beginner. The author assumes that the reader has developed the skills and methods that are needed in any kitchen. I have worked professionally as a chef for 25 years and assure you that this work will always be on my bookshelf. When it comes to classic French cuisine this work is indispensible 
This is THE book on Classic French Technique and Cuisine by the Master chef, Auguste Escoffier. This the English translation of the 4th Edition of the Guide Culinaire by Cracknell and Kaufmann, and it supersedes translations of the Guide to Modern Cookery (1907). This is the "real" English translation with over 5,012 brief recipes for sauces, garnishes, soups, hors d'oeuvres, eggs, fish, poultry, game, garde manger, vegetables, desserts, ice creams and ices...on and on! Don't waste your money on the new abridged versions which have less than 5,000 or less than 3,000 recipes, as you'll be missing thousands of recipes and their commentary, for no good reason! Classic terms are clearly defined and described, and just about any recipe you have heard of in French cooking is here. This is for intermediate level and up cooks and chefs, as unlike conventional cookbooks, a knowlege of cooking is presumed, lest this be far more than than it's 646 pages in length. There are no pictures, none are really needed. Some recipes do make a gallon of sauce, rather than just enough for a couple or foursome to enjoy, so scale back or freeze a lot! Why read it? For me, it's living culinary history, and the recipes can make one drool with their simplicity or lushness...It's the source of thousands of "tried and true" recipes, unsullied by "fusion" fads or foolishness, where a "souffle" defines anything from a pancake to a meringue topping, and even "molten chocolate brownies" are also called "souffles" by food knowledge-challenged "writers" who apparently do not bother to read a recipe, nor have made or tasted a true souffle. I read the name of a tasty dish at a restaurant, and later see how closely it adheres to the recipes of almost a hundred years ago, and surprisingly there's little variation when cooked by a traditional French trained chef. There are many pointers on how to prepare things, unusual combinations to try, how to tie a roast, ... all sorts of tricks of the trade that are passed from one chef to the next, and not found in Joy of Cooking or most celebrity chef recipes. If you are serious about learning and appreciating French cuisine, don't need your hand held while evaluating or following a recipe, and appreciate access to thousands of classic recipes collected in one book, then this is THE source and the book for you 
great book not for the home maker of course must have a basic understanding of the art this book is great for refference there is no pics only usefull infomatio 
I teach Culinary Arts and this is a must have for every serious cook and future Chef. You must have some knowledge of professional culinary techniques to be able to understand and use this book. As one reviewer wrote, this is not a cookbook, it is a reference book, and my students use it when they have to do research work 
The book is probably the best reference I've seen. What it isn't is a cookbook for beginners. I'd recommend it for someone that already knows their way around a kitchen and wants a source for myriad (well only 5100) ideas 
There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts. If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it. 
Winchester, a geologist and proven writer, is a perfect choice for chronicling the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. I currently live and work in SF, and enjoyed listening to the book on my mp3 player while commuting in the MUNI subways. True to form, Winchester only spends a small amount of time on the catastrophic event itself, and instead develops the events which lead up to the event -- first in a geological perspective, and second in a sociological one. Unfortunately, this book does not come together as well as his book on Krakatoa. Being a current San Franciscan, I found his history of the city lacking. His conclusions about the current Christian revival as being strongly influenced by the quake is tenuous, but his points about its pyschological impact on society are well-received. The best parts of the books were the descriptions of the science and history of plate tectonics, as well as the detailed historical descriptions of the quake itself. If you're at all interested in the quake, you should pick this up, and also try his other books 
Plate tectontics... yawn... Hey the continents move, we all know that. But what you didn't know is why, what happens with they suddenly move quite quickly. If you live along either the Northern or Southern end of the San Andreas Fault you owe it to yourself to read this book. Lets just say, I won't be living there anytime soon. I liked Simon's other book, "The Professor and the Madman" and that book seemed less dry and fragmented than this one. But Krakatoa and the "Map that changed the world" are now both on my reading list for the summer. All and all good stuff. The way that history should be taught in High School. (and in this case Geology too. 
A lot of good factual information written in a readable fashion. I want my family to read this book. Anyone who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area should read this! I've already ordered another copy as a gift 
"A Crack in the Edge of the World" is a great read that I especially recommend to all whom live, have lived or who have simply just visited the San Francisco region of California. To all these individuals, it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906. This book covers that momentous year and much more as well. I had the good fortune of living in San Francisco for two years in the mid 1980s and experienced one relatively small earthquake. These tremors from below are no laughing matter. They are terrifying. One can only guess at the magnitude of the quake of 1906. Yet Californians are so blasï¿½. Are they foolhardy or simply ignorant? I think the former as no one could be unaware of the brittleness of the ground on which they tread. Simon Winchester's book provides the reader with a brief history of plate tectonics, the precise events of 18 April 1906 as well as some ruminations about the future. He puts this all in perspective and wonderfully entertains the reader along the way. His analysis of Portola Valley as a "deeply dangerous place (that is) liable to be destroyed at any moment" is courageously and provocatively true. I have visited this town many times and been simply amazed at how people can deny the very obvious fact that there lives rest upon a ticking time bomb. No doubt his further view that "many of its houses and offices deserve to be evacuated and abandoned" will be ignored. In the long run, he will inevitably be proved prescient. Winchester probably says much that people, particularly those who reside in California, don't want to hear. However, he is no crackpot. Rather he is a writer who deserves to be read by a wider audience. This book is a great work that I recommend to all....and that includes the residents of California. 
A Crack in the Edge of the World by Simon Winchester is about the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. This being the centennial of the event, there have been a lot of books produced about it, but I had heard good things about Winchester and his writing, so this is the one I picked. I'll have to find another one to read that has the info I was looking for. I was looking for a book filled with stories about the people who lived through it and how it affected their lives. I wanted to read about families separated and united, romances and businesses. I wanted to read about human emotion. This is not the book for that, but that's not to say that it doesn't have merit. I learned about plate tectonics, the formation of the world, the settlement of the American West, earthquakes in the Midwest, and much more, but only 50-75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in San Francisco, and once the fire it put out, the book quickly ends. There is a little discussion about the rebuilding, but mostly just to disparage the effort. Winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of Latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling. His research is excellent, and I did learn quite a bit, enough to sleep well in my stable state of Wisconsin and ensure that I'll never visit California 
Geologist turned journalist Simon Winchester is carving out his own fine niche in popular science writing, of which "A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906" is a very good example. However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books "Krakatoa" and "The Map That Changed The World". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes ("From Plate to Shining Plate"), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his "Annals of the Former World".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name. However, if you are interested in a sprawling, occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake, then "A Crack in the Edge of the World" may indeed be of interest to you, the potential customer and reader 
I am always sad to finish one of Mr. Winchester's books; they are definitely not to be read in one sitting and because they stay with you for so long, it is as if you have finished a memorable semester by the time you put the book back on the shelf. True, they are discursive--but wonderfully so, and "Crack" more than most. Indeed, the cover serves as a hint of things to come--folded into a cover is a surprisingly large poster--just as the ideas of this book are much larger than they first appear. If one truly wishes to understand the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the geological, sociological, historical and other effects that rippled outward in time from the central namesake event, one must prepare for a journey. As with any great journey, some parts are better and more interesting than others--but the combined and lasting understanding of the science and history to be derived from reading this book is unequalled. Suffice it to say that upon completion of "Crack" the reader understands earthquakes and their impact upon our world. Think of your favorite lecturer in college and you get a sense for Winchester's style--a style wryly self-referenced as bloviation. His diversions are often entirely unexpected (and not always entirely supportable) but enjoyable and thought-provoking nonetheless. He communicates a sense of the joy of scholarship and discovery--being able to drive up to Alaska, for example, just to see how the big pipe fared in the massive Denali quake; being able to utterly discredit the worthless dreck rushed into print shortly after the disaster; pointing to that most Californian of attitudes--the stunning failure to take advantage of the opportunity to re-create San Francisco according to a grand master plan, a mistake echoed in Southern California's loss of the redcars in favor of freeways. What Mr. Winchester desperately needs is a format that allows him more graphical content. Something along the old TimeLife science series or the Dorling Kindersley formats. Anyone that can work opera, immigration, Arizona's meteor crater, Watson Lake bashing, fault finding (geologic) and roadtrips into an interesting book about earthquakes needs all the resources he can get. Give the man a series and run him around the world like Michael Palin 
With the 100th anniversary of the Great San Francisco Earthquake I eagerly anticipated Winchester's latest book. I highly enjoyed "The Map that Changed the World" and "Krakatoa" and I expected a similarly great book this time. Winchester again delivers a wonderful narrative on the San Francisco earthquake and the tragedy that befalls the city. A lot of his personal narrative is a bit rambling at times, but the overall theme of the book, the journey across the North American tectonic plate is a good one (though I think John McPhee does it better in his book "Annals of the Former World"). Winchester again displays an uncanny ability to make the complex (plate tectonics) understandable. I only wished he'd gone into a bit more detail like he did on "Krakatoa". Still, I enjoyed the book and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the San Francisco earthquake, and the science behind why it happened then and will happen again 
How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding 
The alternate title of this book should be: THE ~COMPLETE~ AND ONLY GUIDE TO COLLEGE DEGREES BY MAIL AND INTERNET YOU WILL NEED TO READ. Excellent and up-to-date information regarding courses, tuition, residency requirements. I will FINALLY be able to confidently and comfortably select 'THE' Masters Program that is right for me! Tuition is quite varied and ranges from low to very high...Bears' Guide saved me the time and frustration of looking at schools with astronomically high tuition rates. If you are just beginning to look at Distance Learning programs, have been looking for awhile and are not able to make a decision, or you are just thinking about a DLP, this book is essential. 
If you want to get your education and not go into slavery with your student loans. Then get this book ASAP, it covers just about everything one needs to know on how to get your degree. I really think the future of higher education is going this way. But if you want to spend a lot of time, money, grief and get a real ration of manure. Then don't read this book 
And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups. Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many. It's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions. This book provoked in me anger, rage, confusion, compassion, sadness, and tears. I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly. I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks! I am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones. Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.  Randy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s. He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it. It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line. The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material. In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed. It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS. As far as I can tell, it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community. Where will the next Randy Shilts, Bill Kraus, and Dr. Gottlieb and the other saviors come from--and will they come soon enough? 
Good stories work on several levels; they are multi-dimensional views of the same event. To honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I reread Randy Shilts's groundbreaking work, which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the CDC. It is still an intense and provocative book that reveals the social and political motives that became both pathways and obstacles for finding a cause and a cure for the killer disease. Shilts, who tested positive during the research for his book, but said he didn't ask for the results until his writing was finished, nonetheless brings an emotional bias to his research. His regret (he engaged in many of the risky sexual practices against which he rails) runs like an electric current throughout and gives his story a kind of missionary momentum and zeal. As a result, "And the Band Played On" survives as a masterpiece of nonfiction storytelling because it is as much about a human disease as it is about the human condition including themes of betrayal and sacrifice, fear and love, exuberance and panic, loss and redemption - contrasts that the play "Angels in America" perfectly captured when it premiered in 1991. Shilts explored AIDS in America as a disease of both body and spirit - seemingly through the prism of his own tragic circumstances. It's a timeless and priceless view. 
To me this important expose on the begining of the AIDS crises and Reagan's response is extremely important. It's now classic and old information. But it's a valuable history lesson we all must read 
The sexual revolution is over, wrote an old revolutionist named P.J. O'Rourke, and the microbes won. This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war. Author Randy Shilts tells the story of all-night all-day playgrounds on America's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses. AIDS wasn't the gay plague, Shilts reports. It was the 4th or 5th gay plague, nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of Stonewall's closet. Gay sexual activists took it for granted, writes Shilts, that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases. When the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early 1980s didn't magically appear, sexual athletes did what any normal hot-blooded Americans would do: they blamed Reagan. Mr. Shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game. His scorn for bath house behaviors for blood banks is loud clear; cheap-shotting of Reagan is muted. Reagan, after all, had other wars and a rocky post-Carter economy on his hands. By the time Mr. Shilts' book became a tv mini-movie, however, Reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain. If only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name, thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved ... after all, we are now told, we all have AIDS. (Ponder what Reagan might have said if he'd been convinced by Koop or somebody to speak the name of AIDS in 1982 or 1983: Well, as your mothers probably should have told you ... Reagan, being a realist, understood that AIDS in America was/is overwhelmingly a behavioral disease.) Read And the Band Played On in tandem with Dragon Within the Gates by Stephen Joseph, former health commissioner of New York City and former Clintonista. These books, together, are the best war reporting of the recent past. They show how microbes won the war, and how microbes then won civil rights. 
You want to read a horror story? This is it. This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all. EVERYONE ignored it. The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a "gay disease." Gay men didn't want to discuss that it "might" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldn't even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening. By the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease. This book made me cry. The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, "Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people." How absolutely disgusting. This is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring. They didn't give up. No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted. Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994. God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US. What the heck is wrong with this country? Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long? What's so stinking WRONG with us? Another book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years. How many people did they kill by doing that? Far, far too many. We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program. This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn't think that was possible. God bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS 
Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased. I found myself taking extra time and care in reading "And The Band Played On" just to let the information sink in. 
Having seen the film that this book is based on several times, I was curious to read into the whole story... and this book does not pack any punches. Whilst I did not expect a 'G' rated book, I certianly did not expect some of the in depth writing that is included. However it is all relevant to the story. Definately a book for our times 
The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly. This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death. Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer. 
I was required to read this text for a class. I would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure. I found that this text is very attention grabbing, and it is extremly informational. I would recommend this text to others 
Shilts' great book shows us how much of the AIDS related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided. The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not. In between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years. Because the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain. Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared. Rock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer! But even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind. The bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus. And, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death. Shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's. On the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity. 
I teach practical Game Theory for executives. This book its an excellent complementary material for the course 
If you are really into learning Microeconomics right form the start, this is the book for you.. 
I am an unabashed admirer of Howard Zinn, but I am tremendously impressed with Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation. 
While I wouldn't recommend that my students read only Paul Johnson's work on US History, I would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts. Johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the American people/government than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today. He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears. While I agree that he can be classified as a conservative, I would also note that this is not a "conservative's conservative" book. By that I mean that people who are unabashedly Republican, Religious Right, etc., will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history. While Johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures, he does so on a case-by-case basis, always aiming to support his evaluations with fact. In many instances, these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks. They are not, however, smelling of the party line. Indeed, Johnson's book is fascinating for his historical scholarship, research, and deep analysis. His coverage of "forgotten" spans of time (i.e. Grant, Arthur, Hayes, Garfield) is welcome, as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage (i.e. Lincoln, JFK). I found the 1860-1900 chapters to be personally most enlightening. Johnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life. He is not a social or sociological commentator, which will relieve some of his more liberal readers. And in fact, I believe most people--liberal or conservatve--would gain an awful lot from his research and presentation if they read with an open mind 
Paul Johnson's History of the American People is a great response to Howard Zinn's work. Johnson's offers a conservative take on much of the events and people that Zinn criticizes harshly. The book is a fairly optimistic work, speaking to the resilience and ingenuity of the American people. I particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the Nixon and Coolidge presidency and his criticisms of JFK. Paul Johnson has an interesting perspective on American history, as he did not learn about as a child growing up in England. He appproaches American history with a certain zeal not found in other historian's works. I really enjoyed reading the book after reading Zinn's work 
I had to read this for a US History class I took in college and when I received it, groaned at the size of the book. But when I started reading it, I found that I really enjoyed it. It gives more information than your average history textbook but enough to inspire you to do further research on topics contained within the book. Its a big one - but very interesting so you won't mind that at all. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I wish that I didn't have to stop and highlight and take notes as I was reading because this could be purely a ""leisurely" read if you are into history 
This is perhaps the best concise history of the United States out there. Johnson writes beautifully, and, unlike Howard Zinn, he does not let ideology completely dominate the book. But be prepared to spend a lot of time on this one, as it's a heavyweight 
I had to read this book for my college US history class. This is the most interesting history book I have ever read. Besides making a good college text, this book would also be a fun read as it is written like good literature. True he does go on and on about how good the North American weather is, but I say this is only natural for a British Chap :) It is this incredible insight and depth that never gets bogged down that is one of the strong points of the book. A History of the American People reads a bit like Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America in that it is a European that is just fascinated by our experiment in republican self-government 
This has been a most surprising opportunity to enjoy the history of our society as seen through the eyes of a British historian. The author admittedly is a strong admirer of the American people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live. He supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey. We are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that I studied going through school in the 1930's and 1940's. Alas, maybe Washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all. 
Mr. Johnson brings the history of the United States to life in profound and exciting ways. I now emerge from four months of reading and intensive cross study with a WELL MARKED copy of this book and a better understanding of our great nation than ever before. I am already anticipating re-reading certain portions in order to use them in teaching. More than anything this book has helped me to reawaken a passion for history, learning and understanding. Mr. Johnson's unique voice has become that of an old and wise friend that calls us to take back up the moral imperative that has made this country great. I recommend this book very highly, especially to teachers, ministers, parents and anyone else who has a part in shaping the minds of others. This is a vital missing link in a complete education 
At over 1,000 pages of information, this book looks very intimidating. It's so fascinating, however, and so well constructed, that the pages go by very quickly. Entertaining and highly educational 
I really enjoyed this book, in that its not the usual wine and roses type text. He shows America warts and all and I found it most refreshing. Well done 
I just reread this book for the second time. I haven't read it since it came out a few years ago. I enjoyed it this time around as much as I did the first time. The book has everything, mystery, romance, humor, and sadness. It's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end. The main plot is around Callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on TV. She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant. After some investigating and tests, Suzanne is proved correct. But a baby stealing/selling scheme is uncovered in the process. Callie is determined to get to the bottom of it. While that is going on she has to deal with her ex-husband Jake being brought in on her dig, he's an anthropologist. I don't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed, reconciled and explored. Callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval. It is a wonderful love story and mystery. I think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction 
The story seems to go on forever. It is a novel after all; a very long one. Each character possesses his/her own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession. The final showdown is worth the reading and waiting. It is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery - who is the person behind all the killings. Romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception. Conveniently, Dr. Dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case - her own. That leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth. The man she never gets over is there to win her heart again. Her brother who she didn't grow up with has his own love interest. A divorced couple find each other once more. Everything boils down to loyalty among friends, lovers, and family members. Not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading 
Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it. The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.   
Roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer. This is a gripping story...I was glued to the book till the very end 
As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another. Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone. Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction. This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger! Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find. 
This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. I ADORE this book. The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating. Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts). Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot. It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are 
I have been a longtime fan of Robert's work....unfortunately, lately it seems some of the story lines are becoming repetitive. This was refreshingly new and I read it twice before putting it down. There are several different curves thrown into the mix of this book. Everything from Black-market baby selling, to ancient civilizations their cultures, to theories of ghosts curses, to dealing with ex-romances in the workplace. Only Roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing. Here is the cliff-notes version: Witty and beautiful archaeologist Callie Dunnbrook, is sent to small town Woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site. Unfortunately, the town isn't that friendly. When people start vanishing, many wonder...could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves? Not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site; but her partner for the dig, sent from the university, is none other than her ex-husband, Jake!! To make matters worse local, famous baker, Suzanne (think-Mrs. Smith's) claims Callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant. Only problem is Callie wasn't adopted...or was she? Poor Callie must decipher clues to the past; Suzanne's, Jake's, the remains in the ground, and her own. As the old adage proves true, secrets never last forever 
This book is worth reading if only for his journalistic sections of his personal stay in an abandoned station in the arctic. Also, his section which describes the equipment used is pretty fun to read once you've finished the story. I found sections of The Rifles to be quite monotonous, and the historical thread seems to run a lot thinner here than in dreams 1 and 2. 
Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like. It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination. The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction. Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples. As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the "Rifle-text", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea. Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger. As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt. Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the "ages" in which each novel dwells. Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad twisted "love story" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall). But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna. The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial. In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters. On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, "...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?" There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful worthwhile), but here in the most "modern" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced. Sound confusing? Check out the source notes for hints clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which "voices" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to for insight into the original Franklin expeditions. With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later. Next up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt? From what I understand this will be about the Hopi Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970's-1980's. Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century. And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians. Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can't wait - Vollmann's dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various "Ages" of our North American continent. 
I enjoyed reading the Rifles quite a bit. That being said, it was not quite up to par with the Ice Shirt. The plight of the native people of Northern Canada (it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves) is not something one usually reads about. While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the "great white explorers" and have little to do with those living there. I enjoy how Vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters, leaving them to become real humans. I will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment 
Although though it may be hard to begin Vollmann's "7 Dreams" series because each book in the series is so massive, it is certainly worth the time. Not only is Vollman attempting to create, with some fiction, the entire history of North America, each volume he writes is a totally new undertaking. New people, names,histories, and unique grammar reflective to the period. A truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice, Vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears, but since each is complete in itself, that does not matter. I look forward to his next "dream. 
THIS BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME . THE COPY I HAVE IS THE 1932 PRINTING . I KNOW NOW HOW LUCKY I AM TO OWN IT AFTER FINISHING . IT WAS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN .

SUCH AS INEPT GENERALS AND THAT LUNATIC WIFE , MARY TODD WHO'S TEMPER TANTRUMS WERE INFAMOUS. LIKE HE HAD ENOUGH " ROCKS IN HIS SACK " WITHOUT STRIFE AT HOME. I SO PITY HIM , EVEN NOW THAT HE IS BEYOND ALL CARES AND WOE . GOD BLESS YOU SIR AND GIVE YOU THE PEACE THAT SO ELUDED YOU HERE ON EARTH 
The storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes. Americans don't have to. Abraham Lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness, yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties, which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic. This book is a labor of love by Mr. Carnegie about his hero; it's his way of making his hero available to us all. I love particularly the introduction in which Mr. Carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it. This is one of the best books I've ever read. All the wisdom and insight Mr. Carnegie ever collected in his "how to" books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here, because Lincoln exemplified everything that Mr. Carnegie ever taught. This book is what will keep Mr. Carnegie's name alive, long after his institute has folded and his "how to" books have gone out of print. In this book Mr. Carnegie captures the living reality of Lincoln, his wisdom, his virtues, his beautiful and unfettered English prose, his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind, his deep reverence, and his abiding love. This is a book that you never finish. The experience remains with you. Besides changing forever the way you think about Lincoln, it'll change the way you think about yourself. This book is not overtly religious, but I'd recommend it alongside Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship, Chesterton's Everlasting Man, and Thomas Merton's Seven-Storey Mountain. 
If you don't know anything about Lincoln this book is for you! The author, Carnegie, was enthralled with Lincoln and by the end of the book you will be too. The book does an excellent job portraying who Loncoln was from childhood to adult to Presidency. It was the first book I ever read on Lincoln and I ended up learning so much about this superlative man. A great introduction to Lincoln. 
I agree with Oceandweller who said he/she wished this book were still in print so he/she could send a copy to all his/her friends. This book is terrific right from page one until the very end. I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid. Whatever I paid, it was worth it. It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining. Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends. Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men. "With malice towards none and charity for all..." these, his words, keep echoing in my mind. Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation. His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, "When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to. After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them). This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion. 
I first read this book in early 1994. It left a lasting impression on me. The account of Abraham Lincoln's life is remarkably written by Dale Carnegie. This is not the story about the Lincoln that we learned about in school. Lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest Presidents. Mr. Carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the White House. We can see the problems that Lincoln had while in the office of President. It would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if Lincoln had not been President because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable. For example, the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made Lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in Political Science or just wants to know more about the President. This is a very interesting book that I found hard to put down. I have read this many times and I cherish each moment that I spend reading the book 
All I can say is, if you really want to get most out of your life, and wish to be able to tell your friends and family you had a great life at your last day, you should read this book 
I recieved this book (which is "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" in one edition) as a gift from a Dale Carnegie Instructor (Thanks again Ron!). This has been quite possible the greatest gift anyone has given me. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody. Reading this book will increase your confidence and your skills incredibly. Not reading it would be a punishment to yourself, and you deserve better 
A lost love he mourned for his whole life, an extremely difficult wife, endless attempts to undermine his authority, constant personal sorrow - who knew? This book helped me understand and admire Lincoln the man, versus Lincoln the President. They are both likable characters 
This is a thoroughly engrossing book. I could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother's collection of old books. It inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that I do. This book talks about the Lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes. I was impressed with the fact that Lincoln totally despised slavery. Especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers. His triumphs and failures make him seem much more human. Not only was he a great President, but a great human being as well. It illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain. If you can get your hands on this book, it is a must read 
It is a superbly written book about one of the greatest leaders that mankind has known. It is amazing how Lincoln, from humble origins, shaped up to become so great. He is an insipiration to all. I only wish that this book was in print - I would send it to several of my friends 
I have been a manager for over 10 years, and have worked in different industries and different countries. And I gladly admit I still have a lot to learn concerning management. This book talks about concepts we know we should all be applying, such as learning from mistakes, responsibility and organization, attention to details as well as to a master plan, communication, etc. However understanding how Churchill put these concepts to work is fascinating. I did not know that much about Churchill in the first place, perhaps that is why I enjoyed the book so much. It is a nice change from CEOs' biographies. And yes, I am putting some of what I read to work, so it was worth my time and money 
I just completed this book yesterday and I must confess if it was any longer I might not have. While it was mildly entertaining, it contains little that is new or particularly informative. The book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in Churchill's life. Many of the comparisons seem strained. In fact, comparing Churchill's almost single-handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition, seems inappropriate and a little silly. It's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business, or otherwise. These kernals are relatively simple and (it seems to me) obvious. It begs the question, Why, exactly, do we need a book such as this? The people most apt to pick-up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for Churchill. If so, those people will likely have read books which are more informative, historically significant, insightful and generally worthwhile. If this is your first introduction to Churchill, do not let it be your last. Overall, I think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time 
As a longtime fan of Churchill, and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment, the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading. Well it was but only from the 'fan' position. The author sets out with good intentions and early in the book he relates Churchill ways back into the context of today's executive's environment. But, by the middle, and then thereafter, he's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no real relevance to application to today's leadership 'student'. At times Mr Hayward really is squeezing the pips to show Winston as a model to follow - I've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary hasn't picked up on the idea. If you want to understand Churchill it's a good read. If it's leadership you want you'll have to browse further 
I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book. It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his "executive success in the face of adversity." And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized and a bad judge of character. In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend Lincoln On Leadership 
As we all know too well, in the flow of flotsam from academe, there is seldom material that is both readable and edifying. Often neither quality is present. This book, Churchill on Leadership, scores high in both categories. Hayward's obvious in depth knowledge of Churchill and his times enabled him to organize the vast storehouse of material available into a useful and unique way of teaching the leadership principles Churchill personified. God knows the lak of leadership today evidences the extreme need for what Hayward has wrought 
Churchill's leadership and perseverance carry this book. The lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial - as if summing up Churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims. What Mr Hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us (women included). I learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work (I too can work on my short-comings); he had many failures, some fatal for a politician, but continued to soldier on (I too can persevere); he stuck with his own sense of self-worth when every one else proclaimed him as finished (I too can maintain confidence against adversity). The maxims, Mr Hayward, are not needed. But thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth, where we can all learn from his extraordinary life 
Steven Hayward places Churchill's experience and approach to executive problem solving into historical context. This is a must read book for students of leadership &amp; management as well as fans of Sir Winston. A relatively short book about such a significant topic, but well worth the tim 
I love these Examples Explanations books. The rules make sense when you can get decent examples, and these books do a good job of that. If you find your outline frustrating (Like Emmanuels and/or Gilberts - both of which drive me nuts with frustration) try the Finals series books. I like them much better as outlines than the "official outlines." 
Great book. Definitely doesn't cover every area of Torts that you're going to need to know for your course (IIED, false imprisonment, etc.). Get Gilberts or Emanuels or just use your class notes on this stuff though. Also: if your professor has a slightly different view on the rules (even if it's just a difference in semantics) use your prof's rules when working the Examples. Writing out your answers to the Examples throughout the semester will solidify your knowledge and you won't have to struggle to memorize the elements of each rule at the end of the semester 
The book is great as it is, no doubt, but the older editions do not have Products Liability in them, which is VITAL to your studies. Make sure you get the latest edition, which has two chapters on PL. Aside from that one missing element in the older edition, the rest of the book is excellent. 
This book is very easy to read and allows for easy digestion of complex principles. I find it to be very useful in understanding torts 
Very seldom is a sequel better than the original. Terminator 2 comes to mind, along with perhaps The Empire Strikes Back and the Aliens series. But for the most part, sequels suck. The opposite is true in law school support texts. I borrowed the 2nd edition of this book from a friend and found it to be utter crap (think crap on the level of the third Austin Powers or The Mummy Returns). It was almost as if Glannon, during a celebration over the success of his Civ Pro E success, got hammered and wrote Torts E 1st and 2nd Eds in a drunken stupor. It seems, though, that for the 3rd Ed. he either ran out of alcohol or got an editor. It's still not Civ Pro E, which single handedly rescued me from oblivion (and likely suicide) in that course, but it is definitely worth having 
For some reason I think Amazon's reviews bleed through different editions. IE. You will find reviews of the 1st/2nd edition on the 3rd editions page. This often misleads and/or distorts the promotion of a product. The newest editions of examples explanations are fabulous and settle a few issues that may have been present in the past. All to often students expect these to be comprehensive outlines like Emanuels that do all the work for them---no. The grades come to those who work and that is where this series shines. It gives you practice and furthers understanding 
This book was actually recommended for our Torts class and I am so glad it was. Glannon is a great writer and he makes things easy and fun to read (sometimes he is a little too punny). His examples are a great help too, especially around exam time. His practice exams are great at helping you to spot the issues and organize them clearly. Glannon also wrote Examples and Explanations for Civil Pro. That is highly recommended also 
Buy this and High Court summaries keyed to your casebook and you're set. I also used the Gilberts and Sum and Substance 1L tapes while commuting to school--the best preparation with the least effort. AWESOME! This book make Torts my best 1L subject. Even though I forgot a lot of details, the substance stayed with me for 1L and it got me an A in Torts. I'd recommend reading prior to the first year, and then reviewing as you complete each chapter during the semester. AWESOME especially since Glannon includes a sample exam--good luck trying to find many profs to offer that! An ABSOLUTE MUST for 1L! You WILL get your money's worth, and if you keep it in good shape you'll find another 1L to buy it from you when you're done with it. Unless you keep it for Bar Review. This book is like good foreign cars--the resale value stays up. : 
as a 14 year old girl spending my entire summer reading this book was possibly the worst thing my teacher could have done to me. i can definately see how some older people could somehow get into it but its really just not that good in my perspective, to me the symbolism made no sense i didnt understand what they were saying most of the time and i'm an honor roll student with straight A's in english. i really deeply and truly do not suggest this book to anyone that is a teenager because it will bore you to death. it did me. pips character was too boring estella was too much of a brat miss havisham was too shrill, the ONLY good part of this book was herbert. he was the only one i liked. my mother loved this book and is now driving me insane with how much she is into it. yes, this book has given Dickens a bad name in my mind although he may not be a bad writer. i can usually somewhat get into english literature but this was just about all i could bear.in a nutshell...its definately a college read. 
My first complete Dickens book was "A Tale of Two Cities." Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature 
Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance 
First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as "important," as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading 
This book has nothing to do with anyone expecting anything great, so I hate it! This book is perhaps one of the greatest books of all time, but I hate it, because the title is misleading. What the Dickens does the author think he's doing giving this book a title like that! 
Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement 
Read it, no matter what, no matter if you have to read a page a day for two years, get into it and you won't be able to put it down and then you'll think, that reviewer was right I love this book. It was the best book that I read in my junior year, it wasn't required reading, BUT IT SHOULD BE! And Miss Havisham and Estella! After reading about the endless virtues of Lucy Manette in a Tale of Two Cities, I found those two very refreshing and intriguing and completely unexpected. Read the book, love the book, accept the book and all of its truths, and then name your cat Pip 
Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my high school years. Get entertained with Mr. Joe and her violence towards Pip and her husband Mr. Joe Gargery. Also, Pip travels to France to become a gentlemen, which is one of the best parts of this novel. 
Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it 
Dickens explores various sides of human nature in Great Expectations, as he tells the story of Pip, a common, lower-class, laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman. Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides. The book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur, how quickly man can turn on his closest friend. A very well written story, Great Expectations continuously keeps the reader interested with its intriguing occurences. 
This book is well written and very ambitious in its scope. It is fascinating to get a "people's eye" view of the rise of Sun Yat Sen. Additionally it empathically covers the social response to mixed marriages by two very different cultures. This is a women orienated book about a very tumultous time and ties the events together skillfully in the Western U.S. and the emerging China of 100 years ago 
When I received this book I was really eager to read it. The whole storyline appealed to me and I was convinced, based on the first few chapters, that I would enjoy it. I'm not sure when I changed my mind. Maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political China when I just wanted to know more about the main characters. Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story. While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side. I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts. Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing. The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable. To me, that's a deal-breaker 
I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK 
Using stories told by her Grandfather, Aimee Liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in China. The story starts in San Francisco at the time of the big quake. It is a love story of an American girl and a very educated Chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a Chinese person, much less married one. Her husband is a part of Sun Yet-sen's battle to topple the Manchu Dynasty. Within the novel is the history of China from the Opium War in 1840 to the Communist's War of Liberation in 1949. Good insight into the people of China and their relationship with the Western Powers 
I had to write a few words. Every now and then I hit upon an author that pulls and pushes at your heart. I listen to dozens of audio books every month driving to and from work. This story was so very well written. It has real life in it. It has passion, love, danger, devotion, understanding, pain - it has it all. It is a must read/listen for historical and just plain enjoyment reasons. (The plot is in the description.) I must now seek out other books by this author. If you want to fill moments of your life with a treasure include this story. doroth 
While I don't believe that Elizabeth was totally the excellent strategizer, I do believe she was well advised and did her own thinking. This book goes back and imposing upon historical events the decisions made by Elizabeth-I and how it would apply in business today. There are certain parallels between a monarchy and corporation that do fit together and can be seen in examples. The major portion of the book covers the image that Elizabeth set forth by taking on being the image of the Mother Mary (Catholic church) to her subjects, thus, to make the people more accepting of the new Church of England as the religious seat of power, thus diffusing the Vatican's hold over the people. My only complaint, like others opinions, there were no mention of where things went wrong, only highlighting the good things. This is a very good book still and I recommend it along with another book called Big Chief Elizabeth (which is more of the history of the new World and Elizabeth's funding of the voyages to capture more land). 
Elizabeth I CEO was a wonderful reading that inspired me a lot. My wife and I kept fighting on who gets to to have the book first, it is one of those books that you hate to leave unfinished. The lessons of Elizabeths leadership are compelling and quite inapiring. I never thought that I would need a book on inspiration in my life, but this book indeed changed this view as well. Excellent work 
I do have a comment on history content, in response to one of other reviews I read -let's keep in mind that, if it wasn't for Elizabeth I there would be no empire to pass along to James I-England would be swallowed up by either France or Spain. Surely, Elizabeth I made a few mistakes like every other monarch, but they fade out in comparison to her achievements. She truly did build an empire, and serves as a great example of a true leader.

Oriana Fallaci died recently and loss will be felt in the Europe that decided to ignore her once she voiced her criticism of it mindless poltical correctness that threatens its very existence. "The Force Of Reason" is a call for Europe to wake up and fight back against Islamization. Fallaci knew her time was limited when she wrote this book. In a way, it is to be regretted that not only was she aware of her impending death, but that she decided to do her own English version. Fallaci's English was not up to the task and, as a result, the book is an unnecessarily difficult read which will understandably put many people off. Too bad because Fallaci's message is important. Fallaci correcetly perceives the menace of Islam in Europe. She recognizes the mass migration of Muslims and their refusal to assimilate as an invasion intended to conquer Europe. She laments, loudly and shrilly, the craven cowardice of the politically correct left. What really infuriated Europe's so-called liberals was Fallaci's tracing of their history back through their origins as socialists, fascists and communists. Fallaci distinguishes between the "left" of pre-Bolshevik days and the "left" that emerged after WWII and predominates in Europe today. Fallaci engages in a lot of self-referential comments, talking about her "martyrdom". She was badly treated by the intellectuals in Europe who did not like her message. Her self-pity is understandable, but a distraction. Fallaci's message is simple in the end: "The decline of intelligence is he decline of Reason . . . Refusing to admit that all Islam is a pond inside which we are drowning, in fact, is against Reason.A" Fallaci provides more than ample evidence of her latter point which proves the former. Many will not appreciate Fallaci's message, but no one will be able to disprove her facts. Jerr 
A comprhensive expose' of Islam and rebukes the traditional thinking in America that the Muslims are "just like us" 
 If you are up to challenge your own traditional views and the daily bland diet of information that is churned by the conventional media and pundits on the oral and written media then you are for a ride! The author compels critical action from her readers. If you are up to challenge your very own traditional views on Islam, and not satisfied with the bland diet of information that is churned by the conventional media and pundits .... Then you are for a ride! Whether you agree with author or not, she compels you to critical mental and emotional reaction. 
I used to admire this woman. She was smart. She inspired me when I was young. It is a shame, however, to see her intellectual decline in her last years. Was this the effect cancer had on her brain? First, I can't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called "The Force of Reason." She appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality. Second, she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts. For instance, she quietly forgot the role of Christianity in the Conquest of the Americas and the slaughter of the Indian races. Or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the European powers. And what about the survival of Catholicism in Spain in spite of eight centuries of Muslim domination? Yes, there were churches and synagogues in Muslim Spain. This manifesto doesn't look very different from those fascists wrote about Jews in Europe in the 1930s. Poor woman. 
Oriana Fallaci is no longer among the living. We will have to do without her unrelenting opposition to Islamic nihilism. She died in the United States. Her fellow Europeans essentially expelled her from the continent. They made Fallaci's final years a living hell. As an ex-Catholic, I am more then a little irritated by the Roman Church's capitulation to the radical Muslims. Fallaci described herself as a Christian atheist and was more of a defender of the "true faith" than its own hierarchy! "This Catholic Church without which the Islamization of Europe, the degeneration of Europe into Eurabia, could have never have developed. This Catholic Church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted," added the author. Fallaci rebukes the politically correct and cowardly European culture which is unwilling to combat Islam's racist, sexist, and homophobic doctrines. Fallaci quotes Denis Diderot's accurate description of Islam as "the enemy of reason." The anti-intellectualism and contempt for secular learning pervading the religion of Mohammed cannot be disputed. What has the Muslim world accomplished in the last 400-500 years? Will its more militant adherents return us to the misery of the 8th Century? Are there any life affirming moderate Muslims? If so, where are they? Oriana Fallaci deserves a statue erected in her honor. Will her memory encourage us during our inevitable future trials and tribulations? I strongly believe that this will indeed be the case. David Thomson Flares into Darknes 
"The Force of Reason," by the late Oriana Fallaci, is an interesting book which provides criticisms of Islam while exploring the possibility of widespread conquest of Western civilizations and Europe by the Muslims. Apparently, the opposition was not too pleased with "The Force of Reason" or her previous publication "The Rage and the Pride," as they have attempted numerous times to have the text banned and Fallaci has also been the proud recipient of numerous threatening messages as a result of this, yet the text has become a bestseller in Europe and, apparently, North America as well, as the book is currently ranked at #8 on this site's bestseller list as of today. She shares some of these ideas with her readers by alluding herself to writer from centuries ago named Master Cecco who, in pursuit of standing up for his beliefs, was thought to be a witch who was later burned at the stake and then the reader is treated to a wealth of information concerning the Troy burnings. Fallaci wastes no time is sharing her views against Islamic terrorists and looks with contempt upon any civilization or religion that does not do everything within the scope of its power to stand up to them 
This is high octane stuff and not for the faint of heart. Ms. Fallaci pulls no punches 
Oriana Fallaci is the Rocky Marciano of Italian letters. To her, the best defense is a good offense. If you're pro-Islam you will hate this book. If you're anti-Islam you will love it. If you're sitting on the fence you're in for a rough ride. I've never read anything like this book. The pugnacious Ms. Fallaci picks you right up out of the crowd and drops you in the center of the ring where the fight is taking place. Her emotionally charged first person style draws you into her mind, heart and soul. You soon feel you are fighting for your very life, right alongside her. It's been years since I've read a book I just couldn't put down. Had to take a brief break for some pressing concerns and grabbed the book up again as soon as possible. Another stint of intense and exhilarating reading, and finally radical Islam was left reeling on the ropes. Winner by a knockout, Champion of Polemical Prose, Ms. Oriana Fallaci. ADDENDUM Sept. 18th Obit BLOG by David Horowitz on his website: "A great warrior is gone - Friday, September 15, 2006 9:21 AM Oriana Fallaci has died after a long struggle with cancer at the age of seventy-seven. Her last years were spent in the United States in part because she was hunted in her own beloved Italy because of her war against the Islamic jihad. A fatwa calling for death was issued an Islamic jihadist; an Italian judge attempted to put her in jail for offending the invaders. She found refuge in the United States. But she also embraced America as her homeland in exile because she understood that America was the global center of resistance to the Islamic threat. The attacks of 9/11 inspired her. From her sick bed she wrote two polemics -- The Rage and The Pride and The Force of Reason which are clarion calls to action to defend the West. If we prevail in this battle to defend our civilization they will be remembered in the same way that Tom Paine's Common Sense is remembered as a summons to Americans to defend their freedom. Orianna Fallaci was a woman of unbelievable courage. We will not see her like again soon. May we honor her by heeding her warnings and dedicating ourselves to the struggle to which she gave her final hours." 
This is Ms. Fallaci's forceful reason against the rising and insidious spread of radical Islam into Europe which she refers to as Eurabia. Does she overplay her hand or is she merely telling it as it is? Are Europe's leaders, especially in her native Italy, biased towards Muslim sympathies in opposition to Christian values? An argument not likely to be considered by Muslims or their leaders, though the Muslim side should take note that: 1. opposing and contrary views are inherent to the Western tradition, and 2. many non-Muslims in the West remain skeptical about Muslim claims to be a religion of peace, while their mullahs propagate ingorance and hateful attitudes to non-Muslims; that women are accorded merely partial human rights, depending on the degree of fundamentalist view; and that violent terrorism is an acceptable form of mediating political and social "grievances" 
Very informative - and scary. Ms Fallaci offers firsthand observances of what's going on and what we may expect if we don't wake up. Scary to read about a minority group within a country browbeating the citizens to do just as they want. If the powers-that-be don't develop spines, we'll all be in trouble. Am waiting for Ms. Fallaci's next book 
I found this book to be so helpful that I ordered 20 copies for my team 
I listened to a CD from the library. Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test. For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths. I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g. Deliberative Ideation Learner Analytical Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength. If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money. For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests) For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son. If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money. Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map. If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal. The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000. If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU. 
We are a small nonprofit and have all read this book, taken the test and know and value our strengths - We use this knowledge of each other in our team and individual work, in thinking about our learning and what is next - for our organization and personal growth.

There are thousands of self-help books in the management section of your local bookstore, covering a bewildering spectrum of ideas about how to bring out the best in people. Few of them are helpful, beyond trite statements about human behavior, and even fewer of them are based on more than a modicum of research. Now, Discover Your Strengths is an excellent book on both counts. The Gallup organization has studied excellence in many fields for over thirty years. This book summarizes some of that research from the perspective of identifying and bolstering people's talents. The writers worked hard to make the book clear, precise, and readable. The book never sacrifices clarity, even when faced with complex ideas. I had to read the book twice to make sure that the straightforward writing wasn't masking conceptual problems. It wasn't. The writers lay out the main idea right away; they write that "to excel in your chosen field and to find lasting satisfaction in doing so, you will need to...become an expert at finding and describing and applying and practicing and refining your strengths." They go on to describe precisely what they mean by "strengths," then they give you a tool to discover your own strengths by taking an on-line test. The outstanding thing about Now, Discover Your Strengths is the foundation of research that supports it. The Gallup folks are serious about their research. The claims in this book are based on reliable studies of almost 2 million employees. If you have any doubts about their research methods, the writers supply a technical report on the StrengthsFinder tool in an appendix. I almost wet my pants with glee, reading about interrater reliability, modern test theory, and "big five" personality factors. All of this is safely ignored in favor of the practical suggestion in the main sections of the book, but it makes a skeptic like me confident in recommending this book to everyone on my team. Here are the main reasons why I recommend this book with no reservations: 1) It's based on exhaustive research 2) It comes with a free test...a similar tool would cost hundreds of dollars if you bought it from a career counselor or management consultant. 3) It is carefully written and eminently practical. Now, go buy yourself a copy, take the test, and start a strengths revolution at your own workplace 
Just when I figured I had seen it all, "Now Discover Your Strengths" comes along with a new outlook and a dynamic paradigm. A unique difference from others in its genre is the "Strengths Finder Profile" (can be interfaced on the internet). It covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits. Chapter 4, page 83, does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four "themes" of leadership. If I may paraphrase Vince Lombardi (the legendary football coach): "In practice I do not worry about what other teams are doing. If we concentrate on what we do best, the game will take care of itself." I found that philosophy to be the essence of this book. Focus on your strengths instead of trying to change weaknesses. It is amazing how many companies make this mistake with their employees. When trying to improve sales, and reduce turnover, they focus on the weakest link (the bottom) when more productivity can be realized by rewarding, emulating, and promoting the best producers. Those who have been obsessed with what is wrong in their lives will discover a better way is to learn what works best for themselves and others. The authors' ideas are motivational, inspirational and can be implemented by anyone. There are some revealing comparisons in the book to another prototype leader (Warren Buffett). Readers will be surprised and infinitely impressed with the key reasons for his success. This book should be a must read for anyone in a leadership position looking to improve the bottom line. It is very well done and has no comparison. Reading it gave me strength, buy it and discover yours! Reginald V. Johnson, author, "How To Be Happy, Successful And Rich" 
If you've ever wondered what your true talents (i.e. strengths) are, or wondered why you act and react as you do, this book is for you. In my office, we use the book as a career development tool, and it enables us to help guide our staff in the direction that they are most talented, and therefore, most successful in the long-term. It has helped improve morale and communication. Additionally, this book helped me understand and appreciate myself on a new level, and it helped open doors of deeper understanding with my family. I'd buy this book for a business or personal gift any day! It's rewarding to have an understanding your strengths and then be able to act on them in a positive way 
"Finding Your Strengths" may be Marcus Buckingham's finest work to date. Buckingham and Clifton have succeeded in bringing to life an idea that is enormously practical and helpful. Using themes as a means of describing one's gifts, Buckingham and Clifton have given me enormous insights about who I am and why I do the things I do. More importantly, they have taught me not only to accept my weaknesses but how to management both my strengths and weaknesses, so that, I can learn to be better than anyone else in my strengths. Thank you Marcus and Donald. 
A fantastic book of weekness and strength, a human being is a mixture of weekness and strength equally and those among us who take work with thier strength come out successful regardless of the profession they are involve in, they can focus on thier strength rather than weakness, positive attitude regardless all the adversaries of a life. I learned a great deal out of this Marcus Buckingham book and I strongly recommend to the book lovers don't miss this one 
By: Jeffrey W. Bennett, Founder of LayMentor and author of Under the Lontar Palm. This book turned me upside down. What a novel concept, to focus on what our strenghts are. I used excerpt from this excellent book in a time management presentation for my coworkers. How else can you perform at your peak unless you are doing something you absolutely love. When you know your strenghts, it's easier to focus on being successful where you are. If you are concerned about weaknesses, then you are spinning your wheels. It's like Pareto's Principle. You need to focus your efforts on the 20% that makes 80% of the results and this books shows you how 
Having attended one of Walter's workshops on book selection, I look forward to his updated books. He is, as he says, opinionated, but he backs up his opinions with solid expertise. Unlike other "guide" books, his is a lot of fun to read, which in this over-information age, is an important consideration when choosing reference books 
If you're looking for clear, fun, expert advice about the books children truly enjoy look no further. Every parent, grandparent and teacher should have this on their shelf. This is THE best book to buy for a baby shower gift 
Being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen I was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor. This book is a great read and certainly we need to understand human nature and include it in our understanding of our history and ourselves today. McElvaine makes a good first stab at this and I will not repeat his argument again but point out a few important errors. The faults with the book concern the biology, both the factual errors and the lack of real exploration. The descriptions of the mating behavior of primates are not fully correct, especially regarding gorillas - the silverback has a very small penis and testicles and little interest in sex except when a female is ovulating which means at intervals of three to four years, hardly comparable to humans. McElvaine also says that animals rarely kill members of their own species but Dian Fossey stated that 25% of gorilla mortality was due to the male gorilla - he kills both other males and infants if he ousts a resident male. The biggest error is that apes are, in fact, not matrilineal. In chimpanzees and bonobos the males remain for life in their natal group and the females leave at puberty. This is most likely the case for hominids and humans ie human females have hardly ever been matilineal and had the benefit of this base for kin or female-female bonding. McElvaine makes a big case for human 'mounting' behavior which may be valid but amongst other primate species there is no universal evidence for it correlating directly with dominance and submission. Sometimes the dominant individual is mounted, sometimes females mount their female 'friends', sometimes a presentation is a way to give an olfactory signal by a dominant. Also, presentations that are submissive are very different from the upright, assertive, four-square stance of a female soliciting a copulation. These errors do not greatly undermine any of the arguments but do show that when we are going to use biology in an argument we need to know more than just a little biology. The fact that human males have nearly always spent their whole life with kin when females have had to join a new group to breed is an enormously important factor in the repression of human females and the dominance of men and masculine values - including men fighting over possession of such females. Looking at primate behavior tends to show that the roots of some of our behavior were very deep and strong well before agriculture came along. Also, even if we do think more about the male/female spectrum of human nature there may well be a number of males at the masculine end of the spectrum who are not striving to be anything other than they naturally are - ie are extreme males who simply have little or no capacity for feminine values. If these are the dangerous males then the best we can do is to stop allowing them and their virtual 100% masculinity to be the role models for the more average male - or even the average human. McElvaine's points about the false metaphors we use, male-biased language and attitudes, misogyny, a male creator, the belittling of feminine values and behaviors and the impossible way men try to be 'notawoman' are certainly strong and in many ways obvious when pointed out. And it is surely foolish to think that such a lop-sided species can hope for anything other than toppling over in the mightiest of Falls. McElvaine offers a few ideas about how we might be able to overcome our maladaptive proclivities but it is an enormous task both to recognize our human errors and for men to ever overcome their maladaptive inheritance and genuinely not feel so much contempt for the feminine in human nature. It is hard to imagine the necessary changes coming any time soon. A highly recommended read and hopefully it will open up essential further explorations in this area 
I liked this book, it definitely gets you thinking about things differently. I found it very interesting to look at how society and culture changed, including the dynamics between women and men as a result of, or coinciding with the onset of agriculture. I would also highly recommend the book, Guns, Germs and Steel for a look at how society evolves and changes in response to similarities and differences in climate, population, technology. Both these books offer very interesting perspectives, not hum drum at all. 
This book has been especially useful for a university paper I was working on. It passed some time since that but the concepts I read are still fresh in my memory, since it were concepts I've been suspicious for a long time. One might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male "impotence", but if you take an impartial look you'll find he is right. Don't get me wrong: I have no problems in beeing a man, but I'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure, on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman, that he is not a sissy or a gay - wich is even worse -, but, on the contrary, that he is a real macho, a sex machine that can "score" as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence. It's sad but it's the reality. Fortunately, things are changing. In Spain we had notice of the first girl (she's 16) that joined a senior male soccer team as an advancee. In Germany, Angela Merkel is the first woman to be nominated chancelor. In the great majority of western countries, the armed forces do accept equally male and female recruits. It reminds me the movie of 007 "Goldeneye", when the Admiral said to M (a woman) that she didn't had the "balls" to stand in face of the situation, to wich she replied that she had the advantage of not having to be thinking with them all the time... It would be nice if in the future our leaders will think less with the "balls" and more with the brains.. 
This is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published. The fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man/woman and the development of societies is indeed sad. McElvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering. His imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy. I guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self-loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership. That's what happened here. Don't waste your time. A disturbing aspect to this is that he's teaching the next generation of leaders 
This is the book I've been looking for. It explains the world we're living in right now. And where we've been. This book really gets to the root of the basic problem: men arn't able to be men because we're afraid of our femininity. So we're half-men, and we're so [angry] at being half-men that we take it out on women. We blame them for it. That's it in a nutshell. And it all started thousands of years ago, with the agricultural revolution, when we lost our place in society. We were out of a job. And we've been playing catch-up ever since. And still are today: it's still going on. NOTE: I'm writing this on the 10th day of the insane war we're waging on Iraq. After reading this book, you'll understand why these insecure, infantile itiots mask their impotence by waging war. We are at this moment witnessing the catastrophic consequences of the hyper-masculinity that he talks about. As long as we define man as "not-a-woman," we're [stuck. 
This is not one of the better books I have read on history that predates mankind. Before reading the book I knew that women were the first farmers. The author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women. I do not buy the argument 
After reading an editorial in the Washington Post written by this author concerning the Taliban's treatment of women, I had to read this book. This is truly an important and timely book that touches on everything that vexes our society today - women's rights, where men fit into the modern society, racism, and how religion has played an unfortunate part in keeping women down, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. It is a dense and challenging, but worthwhile read. And when you get your copy, pass it around. It should be shared. PS. Someone should tell Bill Maher about this one. It's right up his alley 
This book is a treasury of true American cooking, with the recipes our mothers and grandmothers loved,and that make fond memories for us. Some are still favorites for family and entertaining (Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Stroganoff Casserole), others beg to be rediscovered (Imagine! Coca-Cola Salad), all provide fascinating reading, with their accompanying histories, orginal ads and illustrations. "American Century" has rapidly become one of my favorite cookbooks, both for browsing and for adding to my collection of recipes that please and amaze 
I use this book as a reference guide for my high school American History and African American Studies classes. Everything in the world seems to be here including an old favorite from the 1960s, 'Puree Mongole.' This cookbook is easy to read and most recipes are simple to follow. The best part for me, as a Social Studies teacher, is the gem of the history lessons and time lines associated with all the food preparations. A real pleasure and a book that is priceless if you like the history of American cuisine 
It is a good book to find popular American recipes. Cookies and quickbreads are delicious, and my husband likes the casserole chapter. As I was born and raised outside the U.S., the tidbits about American culinary history in the book are very fascinating. I had to try exotics like soup mongole (a Campbell combination soup), and I admit it is pretty good. The ethnic recipes that entered American mainstream are often Americanized, but it should not be surprising because it is the American Century Cookbook after all 
If your looking for it it's in this book and a whole lot more. My favorite recipes from childhood like grasshopper pie and wafer cakes even that strange perfection salad is there. There are recipes for mystery cakes, heavenly hash, oh just tons of recipes each with a preface which talks about the recipes history. If you like history and you like food this is a treasure. There is a timeline of food happenings and section on the international influences on the American palette 
I recently received a copy of The American Century Cookbook. My wife and I have several dust covered recipe books that are largely ignored when it is time to cook up something new. After one quick shuffle through this book however, we found ourself sitting together and going through the book as if it were, well what it is, an intriguing history book that accents its "flavor" with numerous recipes, pictures and facts. Several of my friends, including my parents and my in-laws will be receiving their own copy of this wonderful historical treasure. I may even have to buy myself another copy because my wife likes to dogear pages that she wants to come back to. In this case it would have been easier to dogear those that she did not want to return to 
When I started cooking about three years ago, I had absolutely NO experience to draw from (except for grilling and pancakes--the two CAMPING dishes I learned from my Dad). Because I did not want to give half my salary to fast food restaurants and eat from stryofoam for the rest of my life, I decided I ought learned how to cook. That is when I started collecting cookbooks. I started with Cooking For Dummies and went on from there. I quickly found that I had a knack for cooking and soon came to enjoy it. As my cookbook collection grew, I quickly discovered that there were two types of cookbooks: Those you cook from and those you read. This is the first cookbook that I have found is good for both. The recipes included are fabulous and it is a great book to browse. The recipes come on all levels so the cooking klutzes and the Julia Childs alike will be able to use it. When you buy this book, and you certainly SHOULD buy this book, go directly to the recipe for blondies. I had never heard of them before but they are cheap and easily made. After I made the first batch, I made a double batch to take to work where I had just started. Let's just say it made breaking the ice in a large office a lot easier. Thanks, Ms. Anderson 
I've just spent a delightful journey reading Jean Anderson's "American Century Cookook." What a treasure, especially for those of us who savoured many of the dishes of this period--but lost the recipes! Now we have them in an interesting, easy-to-read and-make recipe roundup. My copy ofJean Anderson's cookbook is tabberd with post-its to preprare favorite recipes soon--especially Shrimp de Johnghe (page 120) and StroganoffCasserole (page 151). I hope others will enjoy this cookbook as much as I. Anne Anderson (no relation! 
I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection. So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
THis book was horrible. If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have. I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend. I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire. One less copy in the world...don't waste your money. I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes. THis book wasted my life 
If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird. After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people. Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time. I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told. This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing. I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it. But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did. I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat. 
I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through 
This book is great. Augusten Burroughs is genius, and a great storyteller! I couldn't put it down 
One of the things I love about James Patterson's books is his prose. It's a no-nonsense, no frills, "I am what I am" voice that doesn't try to entice you into the story with a lot of flowery language. In Judge Jury, the story is written from a first-person perspective: that of FBI Senior Agent Nick Pellisante. For years, Nick has been on the trail of a powerful Mafia don, named Dominic Cavello, and his efforts are about to pay off. Nick trails Cavello to the wedding of his favorite niece and successfully captures him. The story picks up the pace after Andie is introduced as one of the jurors selected for the court case against Cavello. Andie is a single mom and an out-of-work actress who is trying to make ends meet with low-paying acting jobs that her agent can get for her. The suspense heats up when Cavello's people hires a world-renown assassin to help him get out of jail. The assassin is successful and what follows is a devastating tragedy that forever changes the lives of those involved. Cavello's ruthlessness, however, puts him squarely in the path of an enraged mother who will stop at nothing to get her revenge. Judge Jury is an easy read but also very entertaining. You'll not be disappointed. 
Great book one of Patterson's best I had a hard time putting it down once I started on it. Combined some of the legal ease of John Grisham. Really enjoyed reading this book 
Oh, this was a grabber. Nothing's missing in this thrill a minute saga - which has been voted "the book I most enjoyed while staying in Barbara's guest room." Two guests now have been up all night reading "Judge and Jury". It's featured prominently on my guest room book shelf with a strong recommendation that if they want to read a good yarn, this is it. Although everyone reports favorably on the book, it does make for some pretty droopy-eyed siteseeing the next day. I loved the premise of this one - felt I knew the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip to Ushuaia. I never knew what the end of the world was like, but now I feel I've been there. As a writer myself, I marvel at James Patterson's output. I guess if he experiences writer's block, he just says, "Here, Andrew, you write for a while." Whatever the procedure, they hit an ace with this one. And, what's really great is that while I'm still riding the crest of the wave on Judge and Jury, the news reports another new book about to be launched - "Cross". I can't wait! 
Once again, James Patterson has us on the edge of our seats in another page-turner. He has created a brand new villain equally as detestable as Gary Soneji in the persona of mob boss Dominic Cavello. When Nicholas Pellisante a/k/a Nicky Smiles joins forces with the sole survivor of a bus carrying the jurors for Cavello's trial which has been bombed by one of Cavello's guns for hire to catch the escaped Cavello, the reader is in for the ride of a lifetime. 
If you've read other Patterson mysteries and enjoyed them, you'll like this one, too. There are no real surprises--this novel trods the well-worn mystery formula, but does so entertainingly. Yes, there are legal bloopers, but people don't read novels like this to learn the law. If you haven't read any Patterson, you'll probably like this if you like John Grisham, for instance. These are plot-driven novels with not too much description or fine character development. If you like Law Order, you'll probably like this, too 
I enjoyed the book, I like the suspense, the connection with the characters, I enjoyed James Patterson suspense novels in the way he writes them and how the characters have their own identity and pesonaility 
This book, like most all of James Patterson's books, kept me on the edge of my seat! I couldn't put it down 
An engrossing story well written with twists and turns that make the reader want to turn the page or start the next chapter. I personally found "JUDGE JURY" a more rewarding read than "BEACH ROAD" 
As judge jury, I would highly recommend this book. Patterson can't write a bad book, but this is one of his best 
The Watcher and Other Stories is a collection of three different but thematically interlinked stories. I personally thought that the title story was the most intriguing. The Watcher deals with our protagonist "watching" the voting procedures in a home for invalids/deranged/etc. The home is a mini city and becomes a type of microcosm of Italian society. Smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution. The Argentine Ants is a type of mock horror story. All of the above are extremely well written and executed. Although I did enjoy this book, I would suggest that readers unfamiliar with Calvino try some of his masterpieces first, and then move onto the minutiae of works such as these. 
Grisham departs from his usual genre to write a book with a strong sense of place and time (Arkansas, 1950s). The events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young Luke Chandler. The author creates much the same feel that you get from Rawling's The Yearling, though this is not really a coming-of-age story. As you sit on the porch listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, you become one of the family in this book. You hear the local gossip, worry about the uncle in Korea, and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop. The relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant Mexican workers, the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks. I'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify, but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of Luke. 
While reading A Painted House, I had to keep reminding myself that this was a Grisham book!! It honestly was not like anything else of his that I've read, and I was happily surprised. The story of a farming family and the workers they take on that summer to help with picking cotton, is one that sweeps you up almost immediately. The characters are so rich in description and the dialogue so compelling that before you know it you're thrown into the middle of the story that centers around a young boy who is trying his best to interpret the world around him. In the meantime he's growing up a bit too fast. The conclusion tied the perfect bow on this present of a story. I'd definitely recommend this book to someone, especially Grisham fans who may have a bit of trepidation in reading something not centered around law. 
John Steinbeck is one of my favorite all-time authors (The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden). Grisham has managed to capture Steinbeck's style and weave a tale that captures the reader right from the first paragraph! Luke is a 7 year old farm boy who dreams of leaving the farm and playing baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals. His family are cotton farmers and every summer they hire a group of "hill" people and Mexican migrants to help them pick the year's cotton crop. The work is grueling (long hours in the hot sun) and Luke must pitch in. The only respite Luke gets is a trip to town on Saturday afternoons where he can get a coke and see a movie (usually a Gene Autry western or something along that genre). What happens is that the group hired has a scary dangerous man (Hank) who loves to beat up and maim people, a young girl named Talley who likes to charm young Luke and a simple minded boy (I forgot his name) who decides that he will paint Luke's house (it has never been painted in 50 years and thus the title of the book comes from this). Luke is exposed to a good deal of secrets (two murders and the knowledge that his brother who is away fighting in Korea may have gotton a neighboring 15 year old pregnant). The writing is superb and it excellently captures a forgotten time (life on a farm in the early 50's). I liked this book better than Grisham's courtroom dramas and I hope he has some more of these type of novels up his sleeve 
I really enjoyed this book and, not being a Grisham fan (AT ALL), this is really saying something. I don't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading A Painted House by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found. And right he was. This story was touching and fast-paced. It was enjoyable along the same lines as To Kill a Mockingbird (the only courtroom story I've ever enjoyed) in its background and overall feel. I didn't like the ending - not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't flow with the rest of the book (a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together) but because it's not the way I wished it would go. All-in-all a great book and highly recommendable 
A Painted House is a truely refreshing departure from the typical Grisham novel. I do believe Twain would have been pleased. Sp may parallels (not the least of which is the painting). Not since The Client (another Grisham favorite) has there been such an engaging juvenile protagonist. Like some reviews, I found it hard to imagine that Luke was a seven-year-old. I think any other child that age would have a few more sleepless nights witnessing some of the events in the novel and keeping them secret as long as he does. But the atmosphere painted by Grisham draws the reader right into the backwater Arkansas area in the hot, humid fields. Humorous, touching, and above all riveting 
Fast pace and at times intense. Kept my interest through the entire book 
One of those very lovely coming of age stories. This was truly an enjoyable book. It has been 4 or 5 years since I have read it and the characters and unforgettable scenes still linger in my head. Grisham steps out of the box and encircles a world of writing that I would like to see more of from him. This story is supposed to be loosely based on his own upbringing and the passion and honesty of his experiences are transposed into an adventurous tale. I agree with the other reviewer that the boy shouldn't have been 7 years old and more like 10 or 11. (I have 4 boys myself). I think this is the only weak spot in the story. It just isn't convincing enough to me that he is that young, especially in 1952 when a 7 year old was truly a 7 year old 
I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton 
I realize this is an old title, I've not had a chance to get to all of the back list, I only first read Hiaasen a couple years ago. Anyway, Hiaasen is a writer, pure and simple, but he also has a good idea of what goes on in the human mind and behind closed doors. That kind of cynicism and satirical writing can be horrible if not handled well, but he pulls it off and I've enjoyed the several titles I've had a chance to read. This one was funny and pointed out some of the absurd things we let happen in our houses of government. While the story centers around a stripper, it is really a story about corruption and politics. In any case, if you haven't had a chance to check out this author, this is a good a place as any I suppose and I give this one a strong recommendation 
The mystery of why every single Carl Hiaasen book hasn't been made into a movie has finally been solved. Suffice it to say that Mr. Hiaasen should be allowed to slap Demi Moore until her head falls off, and his readers should have the right to go Skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was "Strip Tease" the movie.  Unbeknownst to stripper Erin Grant, she is at the center of a big cover-up the night one drunk beats up another with a champagne bottle while she's onstage. The bottle wielder is none other than US Congressman David Dilbeck, who heads the committee that keeps sugar prices artificially high and ensuring fat profits for corporate sugar farmers, who in turn pay their workers disgustingly low wages. Dilbeck is recognized by one customer who is so infatuated with Erin he offers to blackmail the congressman into helping her get custody of her daughter, which she lost in the divorce because of the job she had to take in order to pay her attorney fees. When the customer disappears, his body later found by Florida detective Al Garcia while on vacation in Montana, Garcia links the death to a missing attorney and his cousin, who happened to be the fiance of the man who was bludgeoned by Dilbeck with the champagne bottle. At the same time, the bouncer at Erin's strip club, the Eager Beaver, had been attempting to earn a huge settlement by planting a roach in a carton of yogurt. His attorney happened to be the same one who went missing. Erin's ex also goes off the deep end, his drug habit and wheelchair stealing getting out of control as he gets closer and closer to losing it. There's quite a cast of characters, between the bigshots behind the scenes keeping Dilbeck's career on track to the cast of dancers and crooked managers of both the Eager Beaver and its rival club, the Flesh Farm. It's great entertainment all the way, which just makes me wonder how the unskilled moron who hacked this book into a screenplay managed to miss it all and come up with the script that made it to the big screen. Maybe I was a little prejudiced because of that awful excuse for a movie, but it took me a few chapters to really get into this book. Erin was a bit much of a powerless victim at the beginning, but once she gets mad enough to start taking some drastic action, things get going and this wound up being one of my favorite Hiaasen novels. It's got everything we expect from him: a convoluted plot full of off-the-wall characters and plenty of laughs. It even managed to overcome the stigma of sharing a title with the worst movie I have ever seen. 
I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them. They were very funny. This one is not. It is an endless description of naked strippers. I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing. She is just so stupid. Her problems are all of her own creation. And she is not funny. I think you have to be a man to like this book. I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring. I kept waiting for it to get funny. It never did 
Hiaasen and Dave Barry in the same office...how did anything ever get done at the Miami Herald? Another in a series of entertaining off beat adventures where the quasi anti-social "good guy" triumphs over an insensitive self absorbed, environmentally destructive no good-nick 
I just finished reading Strip Tease by Carl Hiaasen. I found his writing to be typical Hiaasen which is to say it is unexpected, sarcastic and witty. In this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past. In this book his protagonist is a young woman, Erin, who loses her job at the FBI because of her husbands felonious past. She then loses her daughter when her husbands past is hidden by the very people sworn to protect her when he is 'hired' as a confidential informant. Erin ends up turning to exotic dancing as it is the only way for her to make the money she needs to fight for her daughters' custody. I found this commentary on society, in particular our views on women's jobs and pay, to very poignant. The only way Erin can make thousands of dollars is to expose herself to the very men who are judging her to be an unfit mother. Following the theme of previous Hiaasen novels, the antagonists are corrupt and oblivious to the harm they cause to both the environment and their constituents. The descriptions of the misconduct is both intriguing and scary. Hiaasen continues to impress with his sarcastic and witty style. If dark humor is what you fancy, you won't be dissapointed in this outing from one of the best writers in the genre 
I would give it an 11 if I could. This book is flawless. From the first page, I was hooked. The characters were the best I had ever read in a novel. Hiaasen's humor was incredible-I found myself laughing often. Even though the movie didn't cover as much ground as the book, I think the movie was much better than most people have let on. READ THIS BOOK-you will love it. I have gone through 3 copies, I've read it so much. [... 
Recomendations for setting up a new kitchen good. The rest is poo 
Great book. Easy to read. Perfect for the beginner cook. Spiral bound so it's easy to fold the pages back. Would be nice to have some sort of menu planner, for example buy the ingredients for one dinner and some of those can be used the next day for lunch or another dinner so I dont have a box of 11 eggs left over. I could dig and find another recipe that calls for eggs too but I'm a begginer cook - I need someone to point me to the next recipe 
This book is a good cookbook for poor, mac and cheese eating college students. The receipes are easy to follow and cheap to make. The only thing I didn't like about it was that is was too short...more receipes please 
As Jean Patterson's sister, I was the target audience for this book. Since I was a college student with little to no experience in the kitchen, I needed help. Scrambled eggs were a nightmare, and macaroni and cheese from the box was as good as got. After testing recipes that my sister sent me I discovered that the directions were not only easy to follow, but the results were incredible. My brownies have even been praised as the best ever tasted. Yes, even better than Grandma's. I find with this book I am eating much healthier, and saving money as well. This book did wonders. Plus it makes a great gift for students! 
These recipes are quite simple and perhaps someone who is an experienced chef might not like them, but I am a singleton who works 60 hours per week and this book is full of quick dinners, and more importantly, stuff that I can make and take to work to reheat for lunch 
I don't know about college students, but I do know that I'm not sure how I've made it 33 years in life without this book. The great thing about this cookbook is, the meals don't take 5 hours to prepare, and it's all very simple--almost as fast and easy as calling up the pizza delivery guy, and a helluva lot healthier. I even impressed my new fiance. ; 
I wish somebody had given this book to me when I left the nest. It covers all the basics and would have saved me a lot of calls to Mom. Everything is organized so well, with what you need listed at the top of the page and careful, step-by-step instructions below. The spiral cover makes it easy to set it down on the countertop and not worry about it flipping over to another page. The perfect gift for a graduate 
If it wasn't for this book, I would have starved 
This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word 
Interesting and insightful. However it can occasionally lack clarity, lose the thread of what is being said. Even so, this is well worth snapping up for a summer read. Especially so if you have not read this kind of stuff before 
To paraphrase from preface's the famous Dr. Noam Chomsky's (a personal hero) suggestion regarding our ignorance, we do not have any idea how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved. I have read this book the year it first came out (1997) and many times over since; should one still belive that thoughts, feelings, beliefs, meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood? Dr. Pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we ,I mean any non-psychologist, take for granted every day. I use my mind every day. (My wife and co-workers might want to argue otherwise, but they are wrong! I do think on a daily basis.). Yet I don't have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain. Is the 17 th century French philiospher Rene Descart right when he proclaimed "I think therefore I am?" What insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since Descart's time? Another words, do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind? Dr. Pinker, now at Harvard and a gaint in this field, do not have the answers. As a matter of fact, he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true. However, he has painted an overall picture on the state-of-art research on cognition. Oh, the book. It has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried (I think and hope) to tickle readers' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs. For example, under the standard equipment chapter, rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind. He used the working definition of intlliegence (ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one's action to reach that point) to illustrate that we use our desires (ie the latest big screen Sony TV) and use our beliefs (ie if I work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income) to increase the chance of achieving that result (i.e. watching the Final Four basketball games on SONY big screen TV). Yet is this stimluli (vivid and beautiful live college hoops on TV) and response (working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income) due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input? Do we endlessly shop for junks we cannot possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all? Perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere knee-jerk response to stimuli. What about the molecular/celluar level of the brain? Can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work? From page 99, Dr. Pinker stated from the mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts that neurons have one purpose in life: "add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded." Are you joking me? With a description like this, it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron. Suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level, as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness (my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks) that might be more important than any single cell. Another words, perhaps thoghts, ideas, imagination, emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these "supercomputer" networking. This conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless. What about complexity itself? Can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival? It is beyond imagination of my limited mind (no pun intended) that perhaps I don't have adequate brain power to understand my mind? So why should I or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way? A mental life is the result of my mind, and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases. Why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space? Is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings? Why can I be peaceful and happy like I want to be every time I am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in Los Angeles? Dr. Pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish. He only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas. I keep this book close to me at an arm's reach every time my mind fails me (more frequent than I like now days and I am only 36 years old) and I re-read it over and over for its shear beauty, audacity, and clarity. Unquestion the authorative guide to my or any one's mind 
Have you been amazed by the things your body can do(and probably cannot do) ... like the great stereo vision, the spatial hearing capability, the ease at which we learn/speak/update multiple languages. How does our brain achieve all this? How does our brain stores and incorporates new information? Where do human emotions come from? What is the reason behind anger, fear and other multitudes of human emotions? What is this thing called consciousness? What is the reason behind the peculiar male, female behaviour? What makes our ties to blood relations so strong? Why we find enjoyment in Art? What is life ... Why do we exist? I personally have been intrigued by these and more of these questions. Most of the time we relegate answers to these questions to some divine entity and many of them we just take for granted. However, this is one of the books that attempts to answer or shares insights to answers to some of these questions. In short this book is going to blow your mind away(literally figuratively). This book not only tries to enlighten us but also makes us ask more questions about our own existence. In general author contends that the evolution process contributed towards the development of different faculties. In affect we own most of our cool faculties to survival instinct of our genes. The author(a great scientist) provides some interesting evidences to support his thinking. One thing I liked about this book is that it is written in a very simple and easy to comprehend language. It avoids references to tongue twisting weird words like Myelography, Parietal, Occipital. Another thing I liked about this book is that it conveys lots of nice information/know-how via the means of references to interesting anecdotes from Calvin and Hobbes, Godfather and like. All in all this is a must, must read ... it is going to leave your awe-struck! -Sachi 
As a layman (even athough I was trained as an engineer), I was quite ambivalent when faced with the ultimate purchase decision for this book, especially after I have read most of the editorial readers' reviews on the net. I was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author his book. My decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick - over 600 pages - the apparent level of complexity, judging from my random five-finger test. However my deep personal interest in understanding brain science the curiosity streak in me finally drove me to buy the book. The first half was quite an easy ride for me as the author offered a general model to explain how why the mind works the way it does. This is despite the fact that the writing was dry monotonous in most areas, witty crisp in some areas cram packed with seemingly irrelevant information. The second half was a tough ride for me as the author touched on the implications of social behaviours. Frankly, I am not disappointed by the book even though I am still puzzled by some parts of the book. My own personal assessment of the book is that it is an intellectual smorgasbord of disparate, multi-disciplinary scientific topics/facts (e.g. natural selection, artificial intelligence, neural networks, economics, biology, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, family values, feminism, emotions, etc.) which probably make my reading somewhat difficult, especially towards the second half of the book. At the end, I have really enjoyed reading this book, particularly in terms of what I am looking for in the first place. I also like the author's extensive notes and large reading lists. The most productive learning experience for me is a better understanding (may be I should say another perspective) of visual perception. In fact, in Chapter 4, the author has dedicated an almost entire chapter (from page 214 to 242) to the perception of random-dot sterograms (or 3D visual illusions). As far as I know, this is the only brain book (after discounting Bela Julesz's book) that I have come across that touches on this wonderful topic, which also happens to be one of my pet subjects. On the whole, from my personal perspective, this somewhat wonderful book definitely gives a reasonably good coverage on the intricacies idiosyncracies of the human mind, in spite of what the author had admitted in the preface: "First, we don't understand how the mind works..."

After becoming thoroughly jaded by the 'standard social science model', and the brow beating of religion, this book was a near epiphany for myself. The writing is crisp, witty, lucid, and provocative. I contented myself with how he substantiated his research, albeit there is a sense of having completely arrived with a comprhensive overview of the human mind and subsequent behavior. I'm sure there is more to be discovered and scrutinized, but the genie is out of the bottle now, and one is compelled to relentlessly and tenaciously pursue this endeavor after reading this book. Pinker will bring you under this compulsion, if not absolutely convincingly but if only to fan the flames of inquiry. Dare to read, dare to change, dare to think. For some, Pinker will open up a 'Pandora's box', but he will leave you with a cautious optimism as well. This read will stike you like Dorothy stepping into color for the first time. This book is now permanently shelved for future reference, which is very telling, because I simply can't say that about the vast majority of material I've read to this date 
Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review: http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
I first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection. From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole. So the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and Family Values rather than the workings of the human mind, though these sections are also a very good read. Having read widely since, I know there is far more that needs to be understood. Particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women, like myself, who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male. Also, with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male. It is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species, though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male. Pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters, sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them, which naturally overrides female mate choice. He is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another. In this book Pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'The Blank Slate' when he writes about rape. Though I now know enough to be able to question points in this book, I still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. 
Look around you: Look at your computer, look at your keyboard - look at all the things which are the beautiful creation of someone else's thoughts! Thoughts can be powerful. But on the other hand they can be destructive. James Allen gives you a small, effective and inspirational manual on how you can choose what world you want to create and how you want to perceive it. This is one of the most powerful tools you can use. If you are able to master the given advice you will be able to achieve anything that your thoughts can create. Everyday we are faced with dozens of decisions. Most of them are made unconsciously based on earlier thoughts that we have put into our minds. This can take us into an either powerful position where we control our life or into a devastating one where we are the victims. In any case, you can choose to be the master of your own fate. No one can ever hold you back from achieving what you want to achieve, except one person: You! 
What an awesome book. Some of the greatest things in life come in the smallest packages. This book explains how thought leads to attitude leads to action leads to habit leads to character which leads to destiny. It is my belief that this simple but powerful truth is one of the most overlooked principles in the world. This book is literally a gold mine of awesome aphorisms and quotes including one of the greatest statements of all time: "Men do not attract what they are but that which they are". This is one the most important pieces of writing to grace the planet earth. I do not leave home without it 
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "A man is what he thinks about all day long..." We are...we really, really are. But the sad fact of the matter is, most of us do not really know what we are thinking. In fact, I would say that most of us aren't really thinking at all. Most of us are just operating on unconscious reactions to things. Does this make your butt twitch? Does this make you a little nervous? It should...but...don't get too nervous...don't go too much in a panic. If there is something from this review that I want you to remember the most, is this: WHAT THOUGHT HAS DONE, THOUGHT CAN UNDO!! Think about this for the next 25 years of your life. Meditate upon this powerful Truth. Who you are is simply the residual effect of what you have thought about in the past. This is is a new day! This is a new opportunity for you to turn EVERYTHING around! If you have been ill or sick, now is your time to claim health and wellness. If you have been experiencing lack or limitation, now is the accepted time to claim wealth and abundance. You see, the universe never holds anything back from you. Never!

Small easy read that has to be the best self-help, Sprititually helpful; but not at all religious. Can read it in a couple of hours but each line is so powerful and easily understood that you want to study each one 
When thoroughly digested and fully comprehended, the principles and their practical application of James Allen's classic will Change Your Life...and more importantly the way you think about it, instantaneously 
The idea in the book is known to most of us, yet we don't realize how much impact it has on our life. I wish I read this book when I was a teenager. It might have changed the course of my life for better. but it is never too late. The ideas in this book make you take charge of your life, inspires you to steer your own ship of life. it is truly life changing book. I ordered the Audio CD. The begining was a bit confusing, but after I got used to their style, I started to comprehend it 
1. Discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you. `As A Man Thinketh' by James Allen encompasses the idea that "All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts." James Allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that "In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man's weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own and not another man's." Before reading the book I was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience. I have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to, though I was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create? After reading this book I felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective. I felt as though I had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life, slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture. A world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance I could begin to experiment to see just what exactly I can create. This same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. As each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent. "Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results." Mentally reviewing past experiences I can see and understand the correlation between thoughts I had chosen to entertain and my circumstances. Looking at my present situation I can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality I see before me. At an ever increasing pace I am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present, my future and my past. The more I practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way. Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to "drift" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction. Reading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives. Through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody. If there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created. 2. Can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships, your beliefs, your goals, your values, etc? Explain. Since reading As A Man Thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me, as I can, to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions. Embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society. I believe this would push us all in a more positive direction. I can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework, frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box. If our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking. If we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality, and even learn to positively influence reality, then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking. My goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision I see of a world that works for everybody into a reality. Reading `As a Man Thinketh' helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet, which is that there is no such thing as chance. Looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined. I do, however, think we co-create every situation in our lives through our thinking. Our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we don't pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the `chance' concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience. Realizing I have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life. The idea to me makes life in my mind fair. At least for the experiences I can vouch for. When I read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and I had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences. About three years ago, just before I left England, I fell out with my best friend Huw who I had been friends with for ten years. One weekend in the summer of '02 after I had just come back from a holiday with Huw and some of our other friends. In the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place. The crux of the story is that Huw decided to take somebody else's word over mine with regards to a then recent situation. The information Huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being. At first the situation seemed like a chance happening and I was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about, having arisen from decisions based on what I knew to be a fabrication. I felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary. I really didn't understand how such a situation could have come about. Could it be that sometimes life was unfair? For days I was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts, searching for the cause of the situation. I started with thinking that the person who had lied to Huw was to blame and that Huw had had issues anyway. I came to various conclusions, however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over. This stirred more confusion in me as it was something I did not wish to believe. After really stepping out of the picture, leaving the country for Cambodia, which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life, and then thinking about my relationship with Huw retrospectively I came to see that just as 'Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.' life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship. I asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant. If I had been a good enough friend to Huw then trust would have gone without question. I had lost the trust and faith of a friend. The deterioration of my relationship with Huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where I was forced to pay attention. The situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important. It wasn't anything to do with one situation. I had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues I should have paid attention to, until finally it was right in my face and I had to pay attention. A man does not come to the alms-house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force. The criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity, its strength and weakness. 3. What are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book? Please Explain. One of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances. After reading As a Man Thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it's supposed to, indeed quite perfectly, and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules. James Allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way. If there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer? My understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer, it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow. It is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind, body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another. I believe we all have what I can at best describe as a magical force inside us. Ever seen starwars? I feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force, or whether it controls us. Where does cancer come from? I think we create it. I think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to... and through our neglect of certain areas of our life, that we cause such a thing as cancer, and indeed everything else, to manifest. We all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good, or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse. I think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness. I think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world - all the conflicts of the world, or the cancers of the world, so to speak. Take for example the conflict in Iraq or the Israeli situation, the problems in South Asia... I believe it's all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us. We are in control... you, me... everybody. And we all have blood on our hands. Paul Sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become. There is no fixed human nature, no predestination, no God that determines our course. And we suffer because we cannot handle this burden. The power to think, feel, express, believe, will, do and progress is, from the start, all within our hands. This is an extremely dangerous distribution of power, and on some level we all know it. As a result, most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to off-load that responsibility. And we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity. Life in orthodoxy is comfortable, familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency. We sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment. The world around us is an extension of the world inside of us. When we do wrong, we are only doing it to ourselves. I think our whole world has got cancer... and it could even look as thought it's dying, although I hope its getting better. If you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them, our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it. Thinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully. Ever since reading As A Man Thinketh I've been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality. I think As a Man Thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race. The more I think about it the more it makes sense. 4. Has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way? If so, explain how? This book has entirely changed my thinking and now I look at life from a totally different standpoint, one where I can see how I am in complete control of my circumstances. Now when I look at seemingly problematic situations I ask myself why and how I have created the situation and I ask what can be learned from the situation. Reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended, I think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody. Why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened? If we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us, no matter what they are. I now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts I allow myself to entertain. Oftentimes I am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from, but now when I find myself thinking something less than constructive I stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling. He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it 
This book is a quick read on how your thoughts determine your life. It is shocking and hard for people to believe but your thoughts are the power that creates your inner and outer reality.This book shows how your thoughts cause your character,circumstances,health,purpose,ideals, and level of achievement. Start with this book to learn how to control your thoughts and create your life 
The concepts are not new and hardly new-age. There are no new ideas in this book, Mr Allan was just the first to present them is all. James Allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book. He states in the book "He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little. He who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly." Effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book. James Allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure. 
Okay, it's a collection of Far Side comics, which is what I want, so it's awesome for that reason. BUT, the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing. First, all the comics are black and white. Yeah, it's not about the art and you don't miss much without color, but come on, would a little color kill anyone (especially ones that were originally color)? Second, it's pretty thin on strips, with 4 to a page most of the time (a good amount) sometimes 2 on a page, and even occassionally one comic on a single page! It looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page. 
Some of my earliest memories are filled with reading The Far Side on my father's lap after the evening meal. Whenever I asked my parents for a one of the standard collections, they told me to wait, one day they would all be in one book. Then, for Christmas one year, I got this book. What can I say, but thank you Mom and Dad and thank you Mr. Larson! The Far Side was, and still is, funny, original, and timeless. This collection gives you some of the best of the original strips and lends itself well to watching the progression of humor up and through until the end 
Gary Larson never ceases to amaze me. I've been a religious follower of The Far Side for as long as I can remember. I love the way he looks at the lighter side of life, yet some of the comics really hit home. My favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark! Go Larry - you're my super hero 
LOL!!!!This is one brilliantly funny comic strip from one brilliantly sick (in a good way) mind. The Far Side is timeless. I laugh every time I read them, and that's a good thing. 
How Gary Larson keeps coming up with this stuff I have no idea. It seems like the more I read, the more I begin to laugh. This particular Gallery is totally hilarious. If you don't get the humor in "The Far Side", my guess is your brain is wired for something different than reading books. In fact, I heard the current President hasn't got a Far Side chuckle since 1991. 
The Far Side is my favorite comic, out of all. It is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard. Larson's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on, comparing the picture to the caption, and it is hysterical. There are scizophrenic kangaroos, plane driving sheep, duck relays, and pretty much any other twisted idea out there. ANY Far Side book is one that will never fail to please. 
Sick, absurd humor is Larson's specialty, and in this collection, Larson is at his best. Many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species, where animals get their revenge on humans. Others are based on themes from popular culture, such as Tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling Kemosabe that the music is starting. They are funny, but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram. If you are a fan of Larson's unique brand of humor, then you will love this collection. 
"Why not write a cartoon book that doesn't bother with a main character and where each joke is totally different from the next?!" That must have been similar to what Gary asked himself when starting to write his hilarious comic books. Every joke is truly different from the next one! And every joke is refreshingly original! Each joke comes from a thoughtful, clever and of course playful mind 
I don't know how the guy does it. They keep getting funnier and there are always ones I've never seen before, as well as the ones I've always loved. You won't be disappointed if you are a Far Side fan. If you're not a Far Side fan, well, then I can't help you 
When I started work at my present job almost two years ago, I found that the place needed a little 'lightening up'. It was casual already, to some extent, so on my next 'office supply' shopping 'trip' I picked up this calendar for my desk. Well, it began a new office ritual; everyone wants to know the "Far-Side-of-the-day"! Sometimes, it's the only funny thing to happen all day. Larson needs to come out of retirement 
This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading. I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book. But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end. That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel. This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form. This is unexcusable in my opinion. I just don't get it. I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages. I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book. This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing. It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends? I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something. 
Intriguing as always, exciting from the first page, strong for the first 2/3rds and less "editorializing" than usual, but it's just not as good as his higher concept novels. But it's still very enjoyable all the way through, and as always makes you think. It feels a little dated now, but I re-read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Sphere should definitely be a part of any Crichton fan's library. Skip the movie, though. Here, the science is less "convincing" than in Jurrassic Park (which is mostly convincing, but stretched) and Prey (which is better writing and fun, but not convincing). But that doesn't matter, because Crichton can write an adventure like few others (as long as character isn't important--character's here take backseat to concept and science). Pace, as always is good. More a rollicking adventure than "something to think about" (typical of later novels) and quite enjoyable on that level. It's the kind of novel you'll tear through in a weekend at most. And that's a good thing 
I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
This is my favorite book by Mr. Crichton...I have read every book by him that I can find...I just found the plot to be very suspenseful and mind-bending. Granted I am 15 so maybe my knowledge of literature is not as high as some adults but this is a great read! -Blak 
This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes. As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy. Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft. He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget. Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is. The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile. This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on. While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more. If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this. 
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read. The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth. This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis. I would strongly recommend this book 
This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. It turned me into a Crichton fanatic. I have since read all of his books. He creates suspense like no one else. Forget the movie. M.C. is notorious for ending chapters with such a cliffhanger you feel compelled to read on. 
I'm amazed at how diverse a writer Michael Crichton is. I really liked the concept of this book. Man builds a spaceship in the future, to leap across space and gather data. It returns back to earth in the past due to an error. The spaceship not only creates a paradox, it also brings something back from its distant journey. Great story. 
I am satified with the servic 
I am pleasantly surprised by the readability of this useful book. The book kept my attention, and it was very helpful and informative 
Bryan Garner brings clarity and insight to the confounding world of legal writing. "Legal Writing in Plain English" contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney. Some of these are obvious (e.g., use a readable typeface), while others are more nuanced (e.g., delete perhaps the legal drafter's favorite legalism, "provided that"). Each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal -- be a good writer so that your reader doesn't have to work so darn hard to understand you. As everyone knows, a simple manual of rules can be maddeningly dull and preachy. Garner has enlivened his book by including a number of practical exercises so that the reader can put these guidelines into practice before the next memo or brief. These exercises range from "basic" to "advanced," and are well worth the time. After reading this book (and attending Mr. Garner's one-day seminar), I submit that this book should be required reading for every One-L and associate. 
Bryan A. Garner is leading what might be a Quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear, clean, unambiguous and even interesting prose. This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage. The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong. He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it. If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn't get to a judge. They'd likely settle. And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were "traditionally drafted." And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause. That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople. The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language. Legal writing is written in English, the same English used to buy groceries, talk lovingly to your spouse, and complain to the doctor about what ails you. There is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson, other than lawyers' need to feel like they're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana. And the writer's praise of "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary" as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement: "DESPITE anything in this agreement to the contrary . . . ." Garner is a brilliant, insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use. We know what happens with legalese: litigation and contention and noncomprehension. Give plain English a try, with Garner as your guide to Aquinas's trinity of wholeness, harmony, radiance, and of course clarity clarity clarity 
EXCELLENT BOOK, ALSO MODERN LEGAL USAGE, 2ND EDITION. ENOUGH SAID 
Yikes! There is no longer anywhere to hide, and there are no more excuses. This book shows you how to drop the jargon, the gobbledygook, the archaisms, and the fluff. So your writing is exposed. Now you must think--and write--clearly, and Legal Writing in Plain English will help. Lawyers and law students have needed this book for a long time. It's superb. (From back cover. 
Typical Danielle Steel fluff, but one of her better books. A little of everything: love, betrayal, tragedy, and hope. 
What I love most about Danielle Steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character, and this one is no different. She has had, in my opinion, some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her 
I usually don't even browse through a DS book. For some reason I bought and read this one. I couldn't put it down, could hardly stand to take a break to sleep. I did cheer for Deanna Cried my eyes out over Pilar, even though her character in the book was totally unlovable. I did get frustrated in the end with Deanna and her reasoning behind not contacting Ben about the baby. The visual descriptions make you feel like you're really there. I liked the fact that Danielle and Ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and didn't play games about their feelings. The ending is a let down though. The epilogue should have been set a few years down the road. I loved it when Marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor editing and the not-so-great ending. Would reccomend 
I loved this story!!! The action is fast-paced and the romance sizzles! Buy this one a nd then buy a few copies for friends they will be glad you did!! 
I enjoyed this book very much. I'm surprised that this one wasn't made into a TV-Movie (i.e. Once in a Lifetime, The Ring, No Greater Love, Fine Things), but I still liked it. Deanna was very realistic. She was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart, and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter, Pilar, who died as a result of a motorcycle accident. She met Ben Thompson and found fullfillment with him; Marc-Edouard was already having an affair with a woman named Chantal. I thought that he was a jerk for doing that to Deanna. But when it was all said and done and when I finished reading the book, Deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was Ben's. At last she could have a happy life with someone. Keep up the good work, Danielle! 
I really really hate that she uses the same names in a lot of her books. It drives me insane. She is always using, Grace, Liz, Andrew..but dont get me wrong, I love danielle steel's books more that anything, but come one, can we just get a little insee weensee bit more creative and think of some different names for her books? please? Im sure that other danielle steel readers will feel the same 
This is the first Danielle Steele book I've read and it will definitely not be my last. I really enjoyed reading this book. By the time I got to chapter 25, I was wishing that I could read faster because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen. I was torn between 5 and 4 stars. I chose 5 stars because it has been 2 weeks since I finished the book and I'm still thinking about it. Why I even entertained 4 stars is because the characters committed adultery. From the very begining you can tell that this was going to happen and I didn't like that betrayal was involved. As I continued to read the book, I fell in love with Ben. It took a while to like Deanna because an affair is still an affair but I enventually started to feel for her. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who likes a good love story

Whether you like Sandy Weil or not is not the issue here. This is just a fascinating book and one of the best books I have read in a while. You will not regret the time that you spend reading this 
This book could be considered a corner stone foundation marker in understanding what makes people relevant, even when they are not. Sandy Weill shows how consistentcy and planning directed to delivering real value for others will result in producing positive results. Monica Langley describes well how a strong basis in fundamental value wins over adversity and fills in a vacume. The book does a good job in reflecting the transition from family to business and the process of creating an icon that Sandy Weill became with his challenges as a broker, American Express, Travelers and Citibank. As a reader, you can see how these companies needed Sandy's pivotal instincts to solve their problems and evolve. 
As a person used to work in Wall Street and live now in China, I read the Chinese version of this book. It was as if I lived, breathed, angered, and cheered with Weill, Dimon, Prince.... One of the best books about wall street of past 10 years. I ordered this book in English and will read it again, for at least once 
The top business journalists in the world are the ones that research and pen the groundbreaking Page A1 stories in The Wall Street Journal. The Journal breaks these stories over and over again, and other news organizations simply trail in their wake. Monica Langley is one of these trailblazers. In 'Tearing Down the Walls,' she expands upon a lengthy Page A1 profile she had written about Sandy Weill and details his Horatio Alger story. The title refers to how Weill "had torn down one wall after another - barriers based on religion, class, even the law - to get to where he was." The cover blurbs refer to this book as 'riveting' (Forbes) and 'rollicking' (The Economist). That seems close to impossible for a business book, but 'Walls' is a well-written tale of a larger-than-life character. You'll blast through these 438 pages effortlessly. It's also worth noting that based on Langley's reporting, Chuck Prince earned his stripes and was duly rewarded in getting tabbed as Weill's successor. And, Bank One (and now Chase) made a great choice in naming Jamie Dimon as its CEO. Dimon leaps off the page as the Crown Prince of Wall Street. Langley is clearly taken with the guy's obvious charisma and skills (Dimon seems to have this effect on everyone throughout the course of the book). 
"Tearing Down the Walls" charts the ascent of Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill, from lowly brokerage clerk to master of a globe-straddling financial empire. What emerges is a picture of a man who is fiercely ambitious and terrifyingly astute - but also seriously flawed. Prone to fits of rage, Weill regularly unleashes streams of expletives on petrified subordinates, sometimes reducing them to tears. He is quick to punish close lieutenants foolish enough to evince the slightest bit of disloyalty. And his laser-like focus on cost-cutting tends to sow disaffection among employees. But he is also something of an enigma. Despite his fearsome temper, he has a tremendous capacity for empathy, often moved to tears upon learning of the plight of others. Shy and unassertive in his early days, he later metamorphoses into a self-assured and forceful leader. Langley is a skilled raconteur and her silken prose is a pleasure to read. Her ability to glean the finer details of Weill's life is also impressive. Without a doubt, this is one of the best business books of the year 
The author could have done much more with her subject. Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character. For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive. At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet. Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly? Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual. But the author never treats him as such. In the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter's of Weill's life and career. To sew the articles together into a coherent story, the author suggests that Weill's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the WASPy Wall Street powerbrokers who won't let a Jew join their club. Perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven Weill for the past 40 years. But it raises interesting questions that the author doesn't address. I'm a Jew in finance and Jews have been very well-represented on Wall Street for some time now. Weill is presented as having been driven to create Citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the WASPy Wall Street club. But by this point we're into the nineties and any exclusive WASPy club had long since been abolished. So all of a sudden Weill comes off as pathologically insecure, which is intriguing. But the author doesn't elaborate. This is a good book if you want a run down of Sandy Weill's career. No other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place. But all that information confirms that Weill himself is a very complex man; to do her complex subject justice, the author would have had to do much more with this book 
This is a very good book. Very inspiring. Langley is successfull in making a very human Sandy Weill 
Monica Langley follows Sandford Weill, a shy Jewish boy from Brooklyn, through his youthful struggles against adversity, his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success. Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We recommended Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative 
I listened to this tape while I was recovering from a back injury. The meditation uses guided visualization and deep breathing to help focus on whatever part of your body suffers from pain. I found it very helpful - it decreased my pain and helped me calm down in general. I would recommend it to anyone with chronic pain or muscular injuries

I really enjoyed this book by Nora Roberts. It is set in the Carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer, IMHO. It has romance, treasure hunting, and a little magic....really great! I liked it alot 
This has got to be my all time favorite book...I could not put it down....I read it several years ago... The Scenery, mystery, romance all intertwined makes for a great novel. 
This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure. You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars! 
I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice. I loved the relationship between the two main characters. I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book. Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars 
With the chilly season setting in here in Washington State, the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long. I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there. This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader. This book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun. How exciting! The plot was wonderful, the characters were likable, the villians were nasty. This is one book that I am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat, and I will read it again when the cold starts setting in, so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure. 
I am fairly new to Nora Roberts. But this book is not only my favorite by her, it's one my favorite books altogether. It was so well written it made me feel like I were diving and hunting treasures myself! And it has such a sweet, romantic storyline. I was really sorry to see it end. I hope there will be a sequel. I recommend any woman to read this book, whether you like romance novels or not 
First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed. While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable. I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read. Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery. Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here. Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching. As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end. The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora. In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try! Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read 
I can't say enough good things about THE REEF! It shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men, and a strong sensitive male that isn't afraid to dream. This is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter and their families. The families run into each other while treasure-hunting for Angelique's Curse - a treasure that has eluded everyone, and many think it is only a myth. But this artifact is worth everything to some, even worth killing another. As this joint expedition continues, it holds all of the elements needed for a great story: mystery, romance, secrets that can't be shared, deceptions and threats. There are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader isn't sure which avenue Nora Roberts will take until she delivers them to it. This always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and gives you a first hand "view" of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue. I highly recommend THE REEF and only wish it would have continued - or at least had a sequel in the works! Great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning. One of Nora Roberts better works! 
This book is good, but not exactly what I wanted. I received these books in excellent condition and in a timely fashion. Thank you 
This update is aces! The added information on pregnancy/lactation safety came just in time (I had just started the L rotation). The Quick Look-up feature is very helpful! Overall, this Drug Guide is a MUST for nursing students and licensed nurses 
While working as an office RN I am often asked by a patient questions about the "new" medication they are on. This book provides the answers. It's easy to read, each drug is broken into quick to find sections and it is very up-to-date. Don't practice nursing without this book 
This is one of the best drug guides I have found. It contains everything you need and then some. It also has a handy cd-rom with tons of information on it. 
This book is very helpful. It has lots of drugs in it, and a lot of valuable info for planning patient care and ensuring there are no medication reactions 
This excellent package comes with both the hardcopy and digital PDA version of Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses, the best drug guide which I have used. How many errors could be alleviated if more nurses looked up their meds?! However, since on most units, medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases, the sad fact is that meds are not looked up. My first PDA drug guide was Mosby's, which I have had for over a year; I now also own Davis's. I cannot tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages, adverse reactions, or nursing considerations. More than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result, but had I not been in the room, the med likely would have been given. How nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket, searchable by both generic and brand names (no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name), always accessible. So now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a PDA drug guide, but which one should you buy. Like I said, I have owned Mosby's Drug Guide for over a year and have just recently purchased Davis. I have found Davis's drug guide to be more thorough. Davis is also easier to navigate. Both Davis and Mosby have drop-down menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the med-entry (i.e. mechanism of action, adverse reactions/side effects, compatibility, nursing considerations, client education, etc); however since Davis has the content divided into more subsections, it is quicker to navigate to the desired content. So, my personal choice is Davis; however I do not think you would be remiss to purchase either of these. I only encourage you to move out of the hard-copy med-book and to the PDA version. You may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides (such as Pagana Pagana's Diagnostic Laboratory Test Reference, ISBN 0323033954; or the one included in Medical-Surgical Nursing Clinical Companion, ISBN 0323031994), medical dictionaries (Like Taber's, ISBN 080361408X), and more. I hope that more nurses are walking around with entire reference libraries in their pockets resulting in better practice, improved patient outcomes, and reduced errors. http://www.hantla.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=20 
For the first time, I ordered my school texts on-line to save money... I am so pleased with the results. Shipment was fast, product was perfect and I saved money. Great for a "forever" student 
You can't go wrong with this fantastic drug guide! It is listed under generic names but if you don't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name. I had a nurse/lawyer professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all. This book delivered it ALL: classification, pregnancy catagory, indications, mechanism of action, contraindications and precautions, adverse reactions and side effects, interactions, route and dosage, availability, nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses! Also implementation, patient/family teaching and evaluation. Wow! I've been very impressed. It came through for me so I didn't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something! Davis's Drug Guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including: recent drug approvals, additional drugs, combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that include class, indications, adverse reactions and side effects, route and dosage and contraindications and warnings. Appendix E is about natural/herbal products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book. There are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites, formulas helpful for calculating doses, routine pediatric and adult immunizations, recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs, schedules of controlled substances, food sources for specific nutrients (ie foods rich in K, Na, Ca, Fe, vit K, vit D, low Na, foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine), and insulin and insulin therapy. Also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past. The organized, easily found references in this guide could save your client's lives. Just because a doctor orders it doesn't mean it is ok to give, as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all! Highly recommended! Good luck all future nurses! Soar! 
The book I received was in good condition. It had a minor crease on the cover were it had been opened. Overall I would buy from this seller again 
I got this book when I started nursing school in 2003. This year (Fall 2005) as a senior, I wanted to get an updated drug guide, so I asked my Adult II instructor what she recommended, and purchased it. It was from another company, and was in shrink wrap, so I did not look at it before I purchased. The company is very reputable, but I found that the layout and content of the book not as extensive as Davis's. That was $35 down the tubes! I would like to see a newer editon of Davis's that covers the many new drugs. As soon as I do, I will purchase 
Bill Rancic, the dashing winner of the first season of Donald Trump's runaway-hit reality show The Apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book You're Hired: How to Succeed in Business and Life that he never went to business school and that he doesn't believe that business theory can be learned from a book. What then is the affable Mr. Rancic doing offering advice on good and ethical business practices? Making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame, that's what. In two hundred pages, he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215,000 applicants to become the Donald's first `Apprentice.' The reader is privy to Mr. Rancic's early entrepreneurial efforts, businesses that whet his appetite for something larger. Readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition. Through it all, Rancic recounts the lessons he's learned, persons he's admired, falls from which he's risen. He offers opinions on Kwame Jackson, his fellow runner-up to the Apprentice title, and `deceitful' Omarosa, whom many believed was the cause of Jackson's loss. He also details lessons he's learned on goals, values, strategies, leadership, vision, and success. While business school grads may scoff at Rancic's straight-shooting and simplistic advice, it is less idealistic than The One Minute Manager series of books. Here, Rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams. The result is one that is as memorable, yet as pleasing, as a tall glass of lemonade. 
This is not the type of book I usually read, but the persona that came through was so engaging that after flipping through a few pages, I decided to buy the book. Rancic personifies the American ideal; wholesome, grounded in a loving family that emphasizes hard work and integrity (and genetically blessed in the looks department!). This fortuitous mix of "apple pie" ingrediants have garnered him national fame, and this book outlines his experiences (along with the lessons he learnt along the way) that propelled him to be The Apprentice. The accounts of his experiences are modern day fables, with the moral of the story encapsulated as life lessons at the end of each chapter. In addition, each chapter contains vignettes of wisdom boxed in grey shading. Many of these are commonsense admonitions we've been hearing all our lives to the point that they have become cliches. Rancic shows that these tried and true maxims of the American dream still apply. I gave the book four stars for two reasons. One, the editing is sloppy. Writing a book in a conversational tone does not override the need for proper grammar. Two, Rancic's references to himself sometimes tend to sound smarmy (as when he refers to himself as "master chef" in the pancake story from his childhood and later when he calls himself an eligible bachelor).Somehow, this takes away from his self-characterization as humble. Such relatively minor flaws aside, this is a book worth reading. 
While lots of books give you high level theories on how to succeed in your business, they usually leave you hanging at the end of the reading not know what actions to take in order to apply the theories in your day-to-day operation. Rancic's book however has a step-by-step recount of how he did it with his cigar business. You will get specific actions that you can do tomorrow to generate sales. While other books give you general directions (and lots of bullsh), Rancic tells you specifically what he had done to succeed his business, what radio station he called, how much he paids for, what's the account was, how much he charged. If you are an entrepreneur starting out or already struggling with your small/medium size business, this book is your road map. 
If you are looking for a book filled with tactics and ideas, this is not it... move along. If you are looking for an inspirational addition to your business collection, then this should be yours. Personally, I loved this book and read it in one sitting. It profiles Mr. Rancic, demonstrating the obstacles he has overturned on his road to success. "You're Hired" shows what can be, and motivates one to achieve 
From the moment I picked up this book and started reading it, I could not put it down! Literally. Thank goodness my toddler was still sleeping in the early morning hours, which allowed me to do so. Bill talks about how he was brought up and how is entreprenral mind was formed. It was a very interesting and inspiring read. If you are thinking about going into business for yourself, read this book. It confirms the fact that if you do not go for it, it will never happen. Bill took his dreams and ideas and turned them into reality. 
I don't so much mind the money I wasted on this book, it's the time that bothers me. Bill Rancic, you're fired 
I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet. Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself. I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book 
Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know. The show was much better, you should buy that. Kwame is much smater and deserved the job. I can tell that this book is another promotional tool. Don't waste even a cent on this book 
I really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series. If you are a fan of Dean Koontz you will not be disappointed. I give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in, but well worth the wait. Whew, what a ride 
This character is a very unlikely hero...A total Geek, who is absolutley likeable.The story fast paced and well written..This was my first Koontz book and it will not be my last I'm actually reading "forever odd" and that too is very good..Read this book 
For me, this was one of starters of Dean Koontz's books. I really liked the book. Dean Koontz is my favorite writers, cause of him I am doing my own book. Pick this one up, really good characters, main character, really good story, and plot 
I didn't know what to expect before reading this book, but after reading it, I recommend it to any and everyone. One of the best I've read of Koontz, and I've read quite a few 
Kirk's book is supposedly the bible of Conservatives. Not neo-conservatives, but Conservatives. He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth). After reading this book I had a better understanding of where the Conservatives are coming from, althohgh I still don't understand why an obscure Royalist politician from the 18th century should be their flag bearer. Royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the US, although we seem to flirt with it from time to time. Conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy, as we currently have in the US: they would rather rely on accidents of birth, cronyism and college organizations to select administrators, rather than people who have succeeded in other venues. A very informative, albeit frightening, book. 
This book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking. It is not very difficult to go online and read any number of Conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day. But, this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of Conservative intellectuals. Often times it is portrayed (not without some merit) that Conservatives are anti-intellectual. I have frequently heard that Liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual. But, The Conservative Mind blows a hole through all of that. Kirk examines major Conservative thinkers like: Edmund Burke, John Adams, George Canning, Benjamin Disraeli, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, and T. S Eliot (amung many many others). The most difficult aspect of this book is to accept John Randolph and John Calhoun as figures to be celebrated. They both were men who used their talents to protect an evil system of slavery. Although, as another reviewer elquently noted, Kirk was not endnorsing slavery or racism or anything like that. Just the fact that Conservatism is a The "negation of ideology," and that change will happen, in Kirk's prospective Calhoun was only following that line of thinking. I personally don't agree with it that far. As obviously slavery was antithesis of what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution stand for. But, again stating, Kirk is not writing to argue that slavery should not have been eliminated- only that change has to follow the methods of that society. I would recommend this to anyone- Conservative or Liberal. It is a magifnicent study of Conservativism. It can be a little dense at times, but that is to be expected and it shouldn't detour anyone from reading it. 
Probably most people reading this already know of this book's reputation and influence, so I'll skip over both the chapter-by-chapter analysis and the praise (I'd end up in what Kirk would call "overweening" praise, anyway). But I do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer. The caricature to which I refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change. In fact, the reviewer even argued that the Soviet Union could have been seen as a "conservative" system (an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media). Perhaps the reviewer missed or didn't understand Kirk's repeated references to conservatism as the "negation of ideology." An ideologist is anyone who tries to rubber-stamp a system of premade ideas onto a society or culture. Think of the "New Soviet Man" in the Soviet Union. Think of the "Cultural Revolution" in China. For that matter, although it wasn't imposed militarily, think of the "Great Society" in America (it worked out about as well as the first two). The "negation of ideology," then, is the conservative idea that one takes societies as one finds them, and then tries to work out change organically from within those societies, rather than imposing it on them from the top. (Think of the current liberal infatuation with attempting to rule America through the Supreme Court for a good example of the "imposing from the top" model.) Sometimes this change can be quite radical, radical in the sense of "getting to the roots" of something, as in the American Revolution (which Kirk discusses extensively). The colonists believed that the liberty they already knew was being circumscribed, and fought to extend it. The reviewer also slanders Kirk in implying he would be in favor of accepting slavery. No, our own Constitution details life and liberty for all, and the organic application of it (as we see in our subsequent history) extends that life and liberty to all. Even the writers of the Constitution, some of whom owned slaves themselves, knew that the Constitution's principles would lead to freedom for all. Lincoln (a Republican, let's never forget) certainly knew it. If you really want to know about the intellectual history of conservatism, this book is where to start. Don't be put off by reviewers whose lack of sympathy for the subject leads them as well to a lack of understanding of the subject. 
I found Kirk's work to be an excellant antidote to the Religious Right and Neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as "conservatism" today. A good place to take back the Conservative philosophy, a philosophy of tolerance, respect, fairness, and progress, from the extremists bent on Right wing "Christian" tyranny 
Kirk starts off with 6 basic tendencies that define conservatism. Among them: Pessimism. Conservatives do not trust human beings to seek the good. We believe human beings are concupiscent, and that government, as an institution made up of concupiscent human beings, is untrustworthy and corrupt. A liberal believes human beings are essentially good. Modern "liberalism," aka socialism, having failed to prove any of its theories as to where evil comes from, has turned cynical. There is a difference between healthy pessimism and cynicism. Anyway, Kirk begins by outlining 6 key points of conservative thought (which are forgotten by our current liberal Republican president). Then he discusses the major thinkers who defined conservatism from the late 18th to early 20th centuries 
This was by far the most informational book I have ever read on conservatism. I learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism. Also this book is very practicle and worthwhile. No hype just fact and purpose. Anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking. To those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book. It is a book that should not be taken lightly. The very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. A must have in every library. It is in mine 
What a charming story! This book is a perfect quick read for an adult over a cup of hot cocoa........or a great adventure for a young girl. It beckons to those who enjoyed The Secret Garden or Isle of The Blue Dolphins. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone wanting a good clean adventure into an old fashioned fantasy world. 
This story is exactly what it is supposed to be - a good story for KIDS. I don't seem to recall JK Rowling saying anything about it having a single thing to do with Harry Potter - she loved the book as a child. Had she said she loved Green Eggs and Ham someone would inevitably launch into why the flying Ford Anglia was based on the blue car Sam I Am drove up a tree. Give it a chance and form your own opinion 
I just found out about this book as an adult, read it and loved it. I wish I had heard about it as a preteen or teenager -- it was exactly the type of book I read as a child. While it does have magical elements, it is not full of "Harry Potter" magic if people are lead here by JK Rowling's comments. It is more fanciful and mysterious, with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in -- a perfect escape from the real world for a bit. It sounds like a movie is being made, which intrigues me. I can't wait to see how it translates to the big screen. Altogether, it was an absolutely lovely book, one I am going to recommend to others to read -- 'tween, teen, or adult 
After reading some negative reviews of this book, I needed to buy and read it myself. I couldn't believe that if the story was so bad, they would be making a movie of it. I believe that this is a charming "old-fashioned fantasy" ... nothing more, so why make it anything else? Let children read and enjoy the story. After all, it is not meant to entertain adults. Silver horses, magic, and peculiar circustances don't need to alarm the children who read the book or see the movie. I, for one, am anxious to see how this story is transformed for the screen. I will let my imagination run free with the little white horse, and simply enjoy the movie as pure and delightful amusement. I recommend this book for children to enjoy and anticipate the plot as the storyline develops. Their imagine will soar! 
Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language. I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs. Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years. Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one 
My mother read me this book nearly 30 years ago. I remember being totally drawn in by the magic: Maria's special room with the star ceiling, the big cat who turns out to be a lion... so wonderful for a budding brain. All children should read it 
I recently purchased a new copy of this book. I read it years ago, in 7th grade. I enjoyed the book the second time and I'm glad I have it for my future children to read someday. The story is a pretty heartwarming one. Everyone gets along pretty well and there really isn't too much unhappiness in it. Everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt. This is mainly a story about learning to compromise. I would recommend this book for children (primarily girls, since the main character is a girl) ages 10-13. Younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them. It's a nice story for adults too, for the child within. It's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a "dog", and the unicorn as just a "little white horse". I must say that I prefer the picture on the cover of the first book I read. It was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn. I think that one was much prettier than the current cover art. Also, a suggestion for parents or teachers...when I originally read this book, it was for a school book report. Part of the assignment was to create a board game that went along with the book. It was actually kind of fun, though maybe these days 12 an 13 year olds may not enjoy it as much as I did. 
If blood and gore is your preference do NOT read this book. It is a simple story with a touch of magic. I first read it when I was about 12 and have been looking for it ever since. It has joined my home library for neighborhood children and my grandchildren. 
I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that. It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives. Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader. 
After literally stumbling across Wallace's "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men," I immediately purchased "Broom Of The System." Through a series of lough-out-loud dialouge and absurdly detailed passages, the story of young Lenore Beadsmen unfolds before the reader's enchanted eyes. Among the funnier characters, there are Lenore's violently jealous boss who is coincedently her lover; Wang-dang-lang, a friend from college; and Norman Bombardini, an obscenely obese lone-wolf with an unhealthy obsession for Lenore. Although there are really no key plots, the story is never dull and a lot of the short stories within the book (critiqued by none other then Lenore's boss who runs a publishing company) are reason enough alone to buy this paperback edition. Although I think the ending was overly abrupt, it fits in well with the context of the character, especially considering his apparent fixation on "words" (the word itself is the word that should appear as the last word in the book, if this made any sense to you whatsoever). Nonetheless, this book is a definite must have for any Wallace fan, and an excellent introduction to him which will not give you a workout every time you pick it up to read like the hefty "Infinite Jest" undoubtedly will. blog.myspace.com/mattyp24 
I hate DFW. I love DFW. And so it goes. This appears to be the tenor of the reviews as well as the general reaction that David Foster Wallaces writing seems to induce. I became interested in reading the late 20th century "greats" and began with Infinite Jest. One hundred pages later, I was sufficiently confused and decided to back off and read some early or shorter works by my authors of interest. Thus, I read Delillo's Body Artist and DFWs Broom of the System. Despite the fact that DFW is clearly more intelligent than me, I managed to finish the Broom of the System. It is more approachable than Infinite Jest, funny, and entertaining. If you are new to DFW, I would say that this book has a similar "feel" as the films The Royal Tenenbaums or I Heart Huckabees. Is this a perfect book? No. Is the writing outstanding? Yes - but not completely perfected. Is the plot compelling? No - then The Historian and DaVinci Code are compelling but thats all they offer. What is it that makes this book worth 4 stars? It is simply DFWs ability to capture the irony and lassitude that characterized the youth zeitgeist of the late 20th century. He does this with humor and zest that are rarely matched. It may be DFWs lack of driving plot that makes people so frustrated. However, recall that the "Greatest American Novel," Moby Dick was panned commercially and critically when first published. Was Melville ahead of the collective curve? Probably. Is DFW also ahead of the curve? Given the equal number of people who dislike or love his writing, it is not unlikely. Either way, The Broom of the System offers an approachable starting point to one of the great writers of our time. March onward, Delillo, Wallace, and Pynchon 
This novel provides an interesting angle for fans of David Foster Wallace- a great book, but clearly the product of a fascinating and inventive writer who is still figuring out the true extent of his voice. Thus, while the book has many of the hallmarks of his writing (the "must....describe....everything" of his subsequent works), it also has a kind of- dare we say- brevity, that is refreshing and works in the book's favor. While it stops short of the brilliance that followed, this is still a wonderful book, full of amazing characters, amazing situations, and is just plain an amazing read 
There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
One of the best non-fiction books available on the subject of what is really happening in America. Recommended reading for those over the age of 18 thhat truly wants to understand what is happening to our country 
With William Cooper now dead killed in a shooting. I feel it shows he was right trying to pass on this information. He gave his life so we would know the truth. 
Alot of folks love to criticize Bill Cooper. I personally think he was reporting truths from his experiences information he got his hands on. He claims right up front that some info may not be accurate. He NEVER claims to be 100% accurate, and gives you his sources for the info, not just opinions. He took a stand to expose secret information he felt the public should know. Whether you agree with him or not, you've got to respect the man. He fought to get this book published ultimately lost his life holding on to that "stand". It's risk-takers like him that gives us knowledge information to see hidden truths. Thank you God Bless you, Bill. Rest in Peace. 
This book is not for those who wish to continue living their monotonous and stressful lifestyles. This is meant to make you aware and to further draw your own conclusions. Critical thinkers only!! Also, this is for the reviewer Robert, from jacksonvile, Florida. You stated that you know the 'truth' about William Coopers death... uhhm were you there? No, all you did was research on the internet and all of a sudden these truths emerged from the files revealing cooper's death. You stated that he was shot and killed by deputies (like the govt.) for resisting arrest. Right, okay then. Aparently, you did not extract any information from this book and you are a waste of life. Watch these movies: The Island, The Matrix, V for Vendetta and countless others 
It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow. I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.  
There is some who would say that Bill is a right wing gun waving nutcase like one reviewer below. But I just think he/she/it is a liberal dupe. There is also lots and I mean lots of conservative dupes. I'd say Bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather. To dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong. There is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination. Their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the Federal Reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts. Do your homework and you'll see the crash of 29' was no accident. The IRS is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers. Now I don't know about the Illuminati or Skull and Bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected. This book covers it all. Not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface. This is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt, slime and worms are. As for Bill's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first. Theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this. Either way this book is a good and informative read. 
and every american should read this book then pass it on to bush his friends and family members 
Pay no attention to reviews about this book. Read and dicide for yourself what is going on in these 500 pages of mind boggling information. You can't really take the book as proven fact, though, as Cooper has mentioned this in a disclaimer in the front of the book, himself. "Behold A Pale Horse" is really just a collection of information that Cooper had been distributing for many years. He faxed news letters, held public lectures and debates, and dedicated his life and perhaps even his death to revealing the truth about the people that rule our nation, and possibly our world. If he's not "one of them", as he states several times in the book, then William Cooper is a true hero.. or puppet, I'm really not sure. The thing that I liked about the book, though, was that he simply proposes several "conclusions" through-out the book, based on whatever information he'd found. He attempted to verify everything that he came across, and I think that Cooper honestly felt like he had a real chance at hendering whatever might be coming. However, what affects might this book have had on the world? If you're on a search for truth, this book is the origin of a lot of the information that people will hand you. I couldn't even begin to think about all of the ways that this book, alone, might have inspired people. Heh, or the number of watch lists I could have put myself on for posting this review. 
Type Cooper's name into Google and learn about what a nut job he really was. He allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun. A court issued an arrest warrant. When two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them. They returned fire, killing him 
A friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right. It is one of the most underrated books out there. It's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old. The real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives. One of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity. Buy it, read it and pass along to your friends and family. 
If you don't have it then buy it. Everyone should own a copy 
I recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life, and I'm grateful that I did. It encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type, however it doesn't leave anything out, while addressing each topic in a succinct way. It is not new, and a few of the examples given will be dated. That doesn't lessen it's messages in anyway. 
Written around 50 years ago this book still holds true. It is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success. Like most 'success' based books the concepts in here won't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple - Think Success and Gain Success. The belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success. Believing you can, will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons, it will find a HOW so you can achieve your goal. Conversely, if you believe you can't, your mind will find reasons to support your claim, The application is always the challenge but this book definitely inspires you to tap into the innate potential within. Coincidentally this book arrived a few days before I had an important job interview and put me in the success frame of mind. I passed the first interview easily, nailed the second one and got the job! It's the sort of book you will read again and again to keep the concepts fresh in your mind. It's also a book you will want to lend people you care about. Highly reccommended. Buy it! 
This book has made a huge difference in the way I react, work, play and think about things that come up all the time. The highlighter flowed throughout and my inner lightbulb glowed regularly when reading this timeless marvel 
I am not sure I would have used the word "Magic" in the title. Actually there is no magic in thinking big. But the results of following the advice given by Dr. Schwartz might seem like magic. The simple truth is that most people have very self-limiting beliefs. And as a result, think in terms of small achievements. Change your way of thinking and you change your life. As Schwartz points out, success is achieved "by following conscientiously and continuously a plan for self-development and growth." And he gives you a plan. The book is well written, full of interesting stories and great advice. If you implement just a few of the ideas he puts forward, you will make considerable improvement in your life. Some of the more notable bits of wisdom: "We learn nothing from telling. But there is no limit to what we can learn by asking and listening." "Others see in us what we see in ourselves." "People who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people ..." "Before you start out, know where you want to go." The book contains a wealth of great information and wisdom. However like any great advice, it is useless unless and until the reader takes action. For the words to benefit you, you must take action. A great blueprint for taking action, but taking action is up to the reader. 
Refreshing audio, letting yourself be open-minded and then relate and apply what you hare to your present situation. This audio cd will is good for those people that are constantly on the go 
This book is a classic just like Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich. The idea is basic and simple; you have to think and believe in yourself to be succesful. It does not matter what degrees you have if you are not going to think about how to overcome your problems be it social, economical or whatever problem, you must take action. As stated in this book action cures fear. So, If you fear something then do something, and the fear is gone... 
I enjoyed this book very much. The author was very clear about her research and the conclusions she reached. It really helps explain the cultural setting of belly dance in Egypt better than any other book I've read, and it's fascinating reading as well due to the little details she tells us about dancers living in Egypt. A must-read book for those interested in Egyptian belly dance 
Too many books about Oriental/belly/Middle Eastern dance lean toward fantasy rather than scholarship. Van Nieuwkerk's book explores the seemingly paradoxical love-hate relationship many people have toward Egyptian belly dancing and dancers and details the history of the dance over the past few centuries 
While probably not the best handicapping book even from the Beyer set, this is one of the more entertaining handicapping books around. You should read his earlier stuff first to see how he evolved as a handicapper to incorporate some ideas such as pace, trip, and form cycles, where earlier he had largely dismissed those. Where I spent a lot of time taking notes from other handicapping books, I spent more time turning pages and just enjoying a good read here 
A very well written book. Easy to read, entertaining and full of useful information, this book makes otherwise complex theories easy to follow. The use of anecdotes and real life examples allow for easier understanding of the ideas presented. This is a useful addition to the library of any horseracing fan. The serious student of horse racing handicapping should easily recover several times the price of the book from using the information presented - that is a safe bet 
Andrew Beyer is the godfather of speed figures in thoroughbred racing. In preparing to bet the Kentucky Derby and other races this year I read Andrew Beyer's fantastic book "Beyer on Speed" and Joe Cardello's book "Speed to Spare". These two books fundamentally changed the way I handicap races. It is simply careless to handicap races without understanding Beyer Speed Ratings and use them to your advantage. This book explains the origins of the Beyer Speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work. I used the information on "Beyer on Speed" and "Speed to Spare" this year (March, 2005) to hit a big trifecta at Santa Anita - without Beyer Speed ratings and the information they provide, I would have never made the bet I made. Andrew Beyer is not only a great author, but he is at the forefront of making a day at the races enjoyable to all. "Beyer on Speed" is a book that will absolutely make your trip to the track more enjoyable than you can imagine. Beyer doesn't sugar-coat the various elements that make handicapping a less-than-perfect science, but he does help you understand the fundamentals in a very concise way. I appreciate Andrew Beyer's commitment to racing/handicapping that is so evident in this book and in all his other writings. Andrew Beyer remains at the forefront of the war against doping in racing and other honesty/integrity issues. Andrew Beyer is one of the reasons that horse racing is such a great sport. This book is for anyone wanting to know how to quickly understand the joys and pitfalls of handicapping - and why thorougbred racing is so much fun. 
This book is not for the beginning handicapper, but has some of the best information in it of any handicapping book I have read. Most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks, but little knowledge is given to the reader. Beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper. I wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days, then show you how they break down the races to make their selections, not with programs they want to sell. It would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track, if they would bet it or pass it

Reading Andrew Beyer is at once informative and entertaining, which anything on handicapping has no excuse not being. While his first book introduced speed figures, and his second mixed the application of them with an appreciation of other aspects of handicapping, this book revisits the holistic approach - always emphasizing speed figures - in an era when everyone has access to more information than ever, and many even know how to use it. What makes reading Beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see, vividly, the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches, in the stories - one might call them lessons - he recounts (the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing). Beyer, like Bill James, is a scientist, and thinks like one, to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides, and making the same old mistakes. People like Beyer and Steve Davidowitz are largely responsible for the ever-escalating arms race which parimutuel bettors are fighting amongst themselves. It's a wonderful game, but if you don't want to get left behind, better read this 
Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before. Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller". The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention. Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense. Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again... 
Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me. When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon. The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded. Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem. The plot was good, but moved slowly. I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much. I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store. I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
Faith is a beautiful older woman that puts up with her husband's coldness in their marriage just because she doesn't realize what he's doing to her. She has two daughter's Ellie and Zoe whom mean the world to her. It's not until she decides to go back to law school that her husband begins to treat her worst by the minute. Both of her daughters are no longer at home and it's not until she meets up with a childhood friend Brad that she begins to see what she could have. Coming back from a trip a day early she finds out that her husband has been unfaithful to her and she finds hope for her future in the childhood friend named Brad whom happens to be married. Faith and Brad get closer as time goes by and the rest is a fairytale come true. In my opinion this book was one of D.S.'s best 
Read the first few chapters and the last few pages. As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition. Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
Wonderful yet so very sad at the same time. I am a HUGE Danielle Steele fan. This book, along with all her others are tops 
The people in Faith's life are dying or moving away. At her step father's funeral, she sees an old friend she grew up with. Her brother's best friend Brad Patterson. They talk, exchange e-mails. And Brad goes back to San Fransisco. When she gets home she can hear Alex upstairs in their bedroom. She needs to get ready for a dinner party. Alex is a investment banker. He tells Faith to hurry up. In a half an hour she's ready to go. Alex looks at her and thinks she looks like his daughters. Faith has so much time on her hands. One daughter is in London and the other is at Brown. She starts thinking about going back to law school. She knows she has the time, with Alex always gone on business trips, and her daughters away. She has e-mailed Brad several times. He encourages her to go back to school. She brings it up to Alex. And he thinks its a terriable idea. She needs to be home to cook for him and be his wife. Not a full time student at her age. She tells him she needs something to do. "Learn to play bridge or take a class at the museum" he tells her. That sounded boring to her. She sends off for brochures from some of the local schools. More e-mails between her and Brad. At Thanksgiving their daughters come home. Everything is going good. Until Alex tells the girls about the ridiculous idea that their mother has about going back to school. Zoe thinks its a great idea. Eleanor thinks mom should be home for dad. Around Christmas, Faith learns that Eleanor is not coming home. Shes upset about it. And Alex finally tells her school is up to her but he will not support her. In January Faith starts school. One of her classes is going to Washington, on a four day feild trip. On the third day the teacher has to leave for an emergency. Faith comes home a day early. She stops at the store. She wants to suprise Alex. When she walks in the house, she notices a pair fo shoes under one of the kitchen chairs. There not her style. She then goes upstairs to find the bed not made. She pulls back the comforter and finds a black thong and a black bra in her bed. She leaves. She returns the next day as scheduled to find everything the way she left it when she left for Washington. Alex is in the same mood as when she left. Faith tells Alex what she had seen. He told her it was her fault. And moved out. Can Faith and Alex work things out or do they divorce and fall in love with someone else 
This book is very good..gives an excellent description of a woman who is in a bad relationship and feels trapped. Interesting how she manages to wiggle free and start her life over again 
This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read. I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book. I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through. This one has gotten on my last nerve. I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable. But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books. It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
This is the third edition of this book that I own. As a dual diagnosis counselor I have found this book to be an invaluable resource. The psychopharmacology of both drugs of abuse and mental health medications are explained in a detailed manner that is very accessible. I find it a valuable resource in helping me educate clients about drug action 
A Primer Of Drug Action is a nontechnical guide to the actions, uses and side effects of psychoactive drugs which will prove important for any psychology or health library collection. A Primer Of Drug Action covers everything from herbal applications to clinical treatments of psychological disorders, revealing the latest findings in the applications of drug therapy to various conditions 
I first read a friend's copy of this book, which he had used as a text in a psychopharmacology course. i soon acquired my own copy, and a number of my friends have read it--it's a very accessible introduction to mind-affecting drugs, with generally good pointers into more specific literature. Julien's strengths are in the area of legitimate, prescription use; i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less complete. the chapter on psychedelics is, unfortunately, nigh-on-useless--errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book. this book has been an indespensible reference for me 
I became aware of this book because it was used as the textbook for a recent upper level biopsychology seminar. It was one of the best books I have ever had to use for a class, and I believe is an extremely valuable reference for anyone with interest in the way drugs affect the brain. The writing is clear, concise, informative, interesting, and complete. Each chapter gives an overview of the family of drugs and then goes into detail on a few of the most common examples. Everything from delivery to half-life to molecular action to side effects is covered. Many of my friends went out and bought the book after looking at my copy to learn about either their recreational habits or prescription drugs. A background in biology would be useful for understanding all of the information, but there are also appendices which explain the basics 
This book offers a great way to approach difficult conversations. There are several templates in the book to show the reader how to do this. However, after reading it, it does tend to repeat certain aspects of the material. I am sure that some of that is for effect; but for someone who is capable of applying material quickly it can be somewhat boring. I still recommend it as a read, but I do not recommend that you need to completely read the book to get the overall message 
The information and the examples in the book are easily applied and really do make a difference. I used the book as a reference working with first line managers; it is especially useful to them in confronting passive aggressive communication styles 
I kept thinking that this book was about business and wouldn't be applicabable to me, but boy was I wrong. This is an amazingly insightful book that helped me in every area of my life, business and personal. Take Susan Scott's advice and apply her suggestions to all areas of your life and you will be living at a much heightened level. As she states it, it helps you come out from behind yourself and become real 
I'm not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that? The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad. 
I've just come back to Fierce Conversations for about the tenth time. Scott has developed the clearest instructions on open, direct communication I've seen in 20+ years of working with clients around communication issues. She gives easy to understand guidelines and supports each with excellent examples. Anyone who has been around long enough to have read the early texts on Action Science will appreciate Scott's ability to put complex concepts into understandable action. This is a must-read for anyone wishing to practice communication at its best 
If you've ever wondered about how to have a single conversation that will make a difference, this book will provide the guidance for that conversation. Scott is quite skilled at creating a simple approach to difficult situations. One caution that I would offer is that this book is not a magic silver bullet. You have to do some work and actually call upon some courage on your own. The tools that this book provides is only have the battle. That which you bring will provide the missing link. There is great value here. This book is truly a gift that you will find valuable. I recommend it highly 
This is a worthwhile book for personal and leadership development. It contains practical tools such as: 1) The Decision Tree for delegation and professional development 2) A confrontation model 3) Questions for one-to-ones (fuel for discussion with colleagues and direct reports) 4) A Leader's Stump Speech: Where am I going? Why am I going there? Who is going with me? How will I get there? 5) The concept of our "Emotional Wake" - worth reading and pondering about. "An emotional wake is what you remember after I'm gone. The aftermath, aftertaste, or afterglow." 6) The image of the crucible to remind us that our job is "simply to hold, so that whatever needs to be said, what needs to be heard, can safely be said and heard." And much more.... There are also many fresh metaphors -- one is tempted to keep highlighting the book. Rich quotations, references to books, music, poetry.... good examples and stories. I also appreciated the "Assignments" and Brief Summaries at the end of each chapter. 
I bought the book on CD, listened to it, and immediately listened to it a second time. It contains invaluable information for self-help, business and/or leadership development. Practical examples that stress the importance of being earnest with yourself and in your day to day discussions. I assumed from the title this was a book about confrontation - it was not, it was about encouraging (and accepting) honesty and constructive feedback in all your human contact. 
Susan Scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all "pretending not to know". I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious. One of the topics discussed is called "Mineral Rights", a type of conversation designed to get deep, past the surface and into the truth of what is going on. The approach accomplishes four purposes: Interrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges, and enrich relationships. It has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate America, and is rarer still where I work now. The book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them. The many questions posed throughout the book, and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace. The answers usually are "in the room" if we can really get honest and start looking for them. In addition to some great business council, much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves. Often we are the problem, and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie, is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships. Another great approach used is the "Decision Tree" to help build empowerment in others. Communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others. (Page 252). Her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool, both internally and in interactions with others, were right on. While this was all excellent, and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches, what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our "emotional wake". We all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people. The question is, what kind of wake do we want to leave? How do we want people to feel? This served as a great wake up call for me while reading. Overall, this book is so full of great wisdom and insights I couldn't begin to do it justice here. From the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout, I believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication I have read. It is both deep and practical, both academically sound and real world tested, and is written in such a way that it felt like a conversation itself. Highly recommended!  
A must read. A possible next target for the US or Israel (check today's news). Let's hope our new Congress is able to make the right decision,after getting the best unbiased intelligence. They should make sure Scott Ritter (who was very accurate on Iraq. He;s not as knowledgeable on Iran-but who is) is thoroughly involved in their discussions. Before any military action,strenuous efforts at real diplomacy with all the players in the region are essential 
Scott Ritter and Seymour Hersh have made at least two appearances at The New York Society for Ethical Culture in the past year to discuss US foreign policy issues concerning Iraq and more recently Iran. The October 16, 2006 appearance covered the issues of Mr. Ritter's current book Target Iran. Transcripts and podcasts are available. It is Mr. Ritter's contention that the Busch administration's primary tool of foreign policy is that of regime change. Any efforts by those nations that are so targeted to engage us in diplomacy have and will be rebuffed. This administration will not talk to those it considers it's enemies. This has been challenged in the media by the James Baker group, but it remains to be seen if they will effect any changes. Target Iran, according to Mr. Ritter, in based on press coverage in the Middle East and private confirmation of those stories by members of our intelligence community. The story is that America is already working inside Iran with dissidents to identify targets. We are also said to be negotiating the details of staging areas for our base of attack for this widening of the Middle East war. Once that is completed, this administration intends to attack. The public is and will be sold the same scenario in which (ala Downing Street memo), the facts will be fixed around the policy. Why will this happen? One element is the influence of Israel. Iran is perceived, and not incorrectly, as a major threat to Israel. But Ritter makes the point that Israeli and American interests are not identical. After the recent events in Southern Lebanon, watching our congress and our administration give their complete support to whatever Israel was going to do, it's hard to see much separation. Whatever the threat to us from Iran, Mr. Ritter says it's very much overblown at this point and should not lead to war. Iran, according to Ritter, approached this administration several years ago to normalize relations and limit it's nuclear research. They were rebuffed. Mr. Busch can only visualize regime change. If this goes forward as Mr. Hersh and Ritter both seem to think is inevitable, what are the chances of success? According to these gentlemen, the results will be utter catastrophe. Iran will immediately shut off the oil spigot. Venezuela will create a hemispheric crisis by acting in sympathy and fail to honor their US contracts. US troops in Iraq will be under attack by the Shia and possibly because of a religious fatwa in response to our attack. Iranian missiles will be directed against the Saudi oil fields to further disrupt the world markets. The world economy will be plunged into a massive recession. This could lead to a ground invasion of US troops most likely from Uzbekistan that could easily turn into a trap. Our ground troops are seriously depleted and under equipped at this point already. Here is where Ritter says this administration could use field grade nuclear weapons to break the back of Iran. He thinks this is the ultimate deal breaker because it absolutely assures us that radical Arabs will find a way over time to deliver a nuclear bomb to an American city. These scenarios seem outlandish, except there are so many radical Republican sources cheering on war with Iran, that one cannot expect this administration to not once again respond with a military solution as the first order of business. Of course, they visualize success not the failure predicted by Ritter. The massive failure of our government during Katrina and the fiasco in Iraq are both symptoms of the same problems in the Busch administration. What if war with Iran leads to the doomsday scenario that Ritter and Hersh talk about. This book is a sober assessment of these issues and should be read widely by the public. The potential of a Democratic House of Representatives in the near future will not change the scenario described by Ritter. American militarism is ascendant. As Ritter says, if the war in Iraq were going well, the public would be very satisfied. The fact that the war is against all tenets of international law and was an immoral act on our part is not something that most of us seem to worry about. Too many Democrats only talk about running a competent war 
Scott Ritter provides chapter and verse on how conflict with the Axis of Evil nations could have been avoided with direct negotiation. The mullahs of Iran sought to negotiate with everything on the table, including nuclear weapons and a treaty with Israel. North Korea still wants direct negotiations. So did Saddam. We don't negotiate with regimes we want to remove. Bush prefers to "take them out" no matter how many Americans die 
This could have been one of the most important books of the year. Scott Ritter provides important, but tangential, information related to Israel's influence over U.S. foreign policy, the history of the IAEA in Iran, and the theory of regime change as the real reason for U.S. "concern" over Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. Unfortunately, Mr. Ritter misses on two counts. First, he offers little direct insight into the Bush administration's policy-making process. And second, someone forgot to edit the book. We are talking about gross grammatical errors, periods in the middle of a sentence, and even a sentence that is punctuated with both a question mark and a period. It is painful to read some of the paragraphs because they are so poorly constructed (at first, I thought my eyes were tired). At least this book attempts to offer something better than the pablum provided by major media and NPR. It does provide some real insights into the workings of the IAEA, Israeli intelligence and exiled leaders-in-waiting who often lead U.S. policy astray. Mr. Ritter is at his best when he stays close to his area of expertise - weapons inspections. This topic requires far more than that 
First published in 1999, and its still going selling strong! This manual has a lot going for it. It is a practical step-by-step manual with clear pictures illustrating every posture, with a descriptive teaching of the postures. David covers the basics, intermediate, right through to the full flow with 263 pages of Davids yoga and teachings. I reccomend this book to anyone starting out in yoga, (in particular) because it does give visual learners good pictures to grasp and learn from. 
This book is the best book on ashtanga yoga on the market - a must have for any person interested in ashtanga yoga. It covers all aspects, showing easier versions of the poses so that the beginner can also follow it. The back of the book has shorter versions of the full primary series so that when you are limited for time, you can do a shorter workout. The only thing about this book that is not so great is that when you have used it for a long time, the edges of the pages start to tear due to the way it has been bound. It has been bound this way so that the pages stay open while you are practising a pose 
This was recommended to me by my Ashtanga teacher. It has great photos and really complements what you hear in class. I understand more the drishti (eye gazes) and what the modifications to the poses are. When I think about it, I open it up and read about a particular pose that I am having some trouble with. It's really nice to have around. I do wish it had the Sanskrit counting in it, but that is a minor thing 
This book is a fantastic guide for your Ashtanga Yoga. I would recommend reading Yoga Mala (Pattabhi Jois) first, and then using this book as a guide for your practice. Illustrations are clear, vivid and easy to follow. The binding of the book allows for propping while praticing. David Swenson does a fantastic walking through step by step how to get into each pose. I use it everyday 
Do you look like this person on the cover? If not, you may want to rethink this book. I got it as a gift but plan on "regifting" it soon. It makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people. Interesting Asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it, but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life, not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young Indian boys. For a different view, take a look at "The Yoga of Heart" by Mark Whitwell. 
David Swenson offers an excellent book to support building a personal Ashtanga practice. I have been doing Ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by David's Primary Series DVD and this book since I first began my practice. For anyone who does not have Ashtanga experience, cannot find a teacher in their area or want to practice outside of a yoga class, David's DVDs are incredible and instructive. This book is an excellent companion to learn the finer points of the practice at your own pace. This book is also phenomenal for those experienced in Ashtanga who want to create a Mysore practice. A Mysore practice is a quiet practice. The only sound is your breath, while you go through the sequence at your own pace. It's a profound opportunity to "hear your own voice" and in my experience, builds a deep inner trust. Swenson's book not only lets you look at one asana at a time, but it also provides an "at-a-glance" sequence for a kind of "cliff notes" effect. This was excellent to have by my mat as a reminder of the sequence while creating my at-home Mysore practice. I have had the great fortune to take a class and teacher training with David Swenson. He has a down-to-earth style, humor and an incredible knowledge of Ashtanga that shines through in his book and DVDs. I highly recommend his work to anyone interested in Ashtanga yoga. 
As an Ashtanga enthusiast, I am always on the look out for new things to add to my collection. My first Ashtanga teacher made copies of this book for me years ago, and I loved those few pages. Now that I have bought the entire book, I see just how wonderful it really is! It explains each posture in both the Primary and Intermediate Series in simple to understand language. Plus, David Swenson includes various modifications for difficult poses, which is always helpful. Also included in this book are a few short practices sequenced togethery by Swenson, lasting 15, 30 45 minutes. These are excellent as well! This is a wonderful Ashtanga book that any yogi or yogini who practices Ashtanga needs to own! Good for all levels - beginner through expert. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 
I've reviewed most ashtanga books out there,and this is by far the best!!! The fact that it can sit on the floor with the spiral binding is a real bonus to any student or teacher.I really like how Mr. Swenson gives options to many poses giving accessability to everyone that can't stretch like "Gumby".Highly Recommended 
This is an excellent look at Ashtanga Yoga. Swenson uses good descriptions of the asanas and the vinyasas that link them and his analogies are a creative look at Yoga: Standing Series and Finishing series as bread slices in a sandwich, with the Primary Series as the filling in the sandwich; and the idea of a vinyasa as the "etch a sketch" which clears the slate for each new asana, and his "physics of flight" and "ground transportation" as a means to jumping forward. My only wish for the book would be that it would contain a fold-out page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page. It would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down. Also, (Ok, I have one more wish)I appreciated the break down of the Sanskrit word into meanings, but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too. Otherwise, it is nearly perfect 
This book is a classic and David Swenson is well loved by the yoga community. I'll admit that I find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes. (David did the design and layout himself). But, you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import. Overall, I find David's voice friendly, supportive and unassuming. He does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students. This book covers a lot of information, including Primary Series and Intermediate Series. Between owning this book and "Astanga" by Jean Hall (0754810747) which has lots of luscious color photos featuring a variety of models, especially Jean Hall, I have access to a balanced presentation of Astanga. 
Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know. Alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party. Every election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage. Alterman tells us that "when it bleeds, it leads". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on. 
To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
Even for the already-converted, this is a great book. Normally I'm not too sympathetic to lefty books that will cleary be read by a number of conservatives that you could count on your hands and maybe one foot. But even the choir will find this a well-researched, even-tempered, fair assessment of the liberal media myth. And best of all, the American public comes off looking like a culprit as much as a victim. Ultimately, people vote with their eyes, ears, and wallets. If the public demands and devours media slop, then that's what they'll get and, to a large extent, deserve. This is great read. He's a talented writer who knows his stuff. And he is very clear about his background, potential conflicts of interest, and personal relationships to those about whom he writes. No exaggeration to call this a great book 
If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
As a student at Oklahoma State University, I am very interested in journalism and broadcasting. Eric Alterman's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media. The purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media. Alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media. After reading through the book, I came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than I look at it. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media 
Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol. That was particularly annoying. He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
After having lived in NYC for 12 years, I finally read this book. It had been recommended as a must-read for anyone who had ever lived in the city. Many reviewers commented on the "leisurely" pace of the story, and I agree. The description of the event in the climax of the story, though, I found too long and almost unbearably tedious, especially since such care with detail was missing from a lot of the other events in the book. The time travel part was especially troubling to me; I wasn't at all convinced of its process. However, I still enjoyed the book and was very satisfied with the ending. As many have said, stick with it. 
This book was on my summer reading list, and I was thinking that it was going to be horrible, but it was the exact opposite. I love the book and enjoyed every minute that I read it! I love how Finney uses pictures in the book, it helps you to grasp the changes that occured in the scenery of Manhattan. 
Others have summarized. I'll add that this novel is one of the best I've read. Slow starting, but stick with it. Read the sequel. Also try to find "The Third Level," one of Finney's lesser known short stories (also about time travel/NYC). 
The descriptions of 1882 New York smack of reality more than anything I have ever read. The reactions of the protagonist are the best of any time travel novel I have ever read - truly amazingly authentic. The tale starts out slowly, but brings the reader to an awesome action-packed, never-rushed conclusion. Extremely satisfying. A beautiful, thought-provoking story. There is everything here, science fiction, mystery, action, philosophy, and a bit of romance. Highly recommended. 
I bought this book in 1970 when I had just started college. It is one of the few books I have kept for all these years and have re-read regularly. The premise for the story is a young man, Si Morley, who joins a government program to go back in time to the NY of 1880's. The past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story. Not only is it entertaining, containing romance and mystery, but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today. This is a book you'll enjoy reading, one I can't recommend highly enough 
While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end. It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers). 
A Quantum Leap of reading. How his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable, and personal, story around each one is an amazing feat. I found myself wondering if he did travel back in time - was it possible - could I do it? I even tried the self-hypnosis he told about - picking the civil war as my target. No -- didn't work for me - yet! Would I love to do it! The ending of this book shook me - he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way. It's amazing. Read "The Mirror" , read Diana Gabaldon's time travel series -- but please don't miss including this book as your number one, best dog eared copy of your library. You won't be sorry 
This book starts out slow, but once you get past the first few chapters you won't be able to put it down. If you know anything about New York, you will find it fascinating. I'm not sure if it would be as appealing to someone who has never been to New York but the story is good regardless. 
The sense of actually being in the mid-1800's was so strong, that I felt I had to decompress to bring myself back to my own time. And I did so very reluctantly. A wonderful story with amazing images! Highly recommended 
I love O'REILLY There are aspects of his personality that I do not like but Bill is a voice in the wilderness of cable news today. He yells and screams as much as the next guy but he actually does research to back his ranting points up. This separates him from everyone else cable news (and radio) weather those people are liberal or conservative. I honestly don't know what side of the aisle Bill sits on. Overall-I think reading this book is worth your time. 
My husband brought this home, and reading some of it, it reflects some very common sense realities about politics, along with some fairly harsh criticisms of many of the "players" associated with campaigns and elections. A long time Boston resident and close to the action in most cases, the author exhibits an uncommon knowledge of more than a few "events" and cautions the readers to try and look beyond the momentary hype to assess the value and the progress of our American political campaigns to see who really winds up on top, and too often, who really winds up on the bottom, and often screwed. A highly informative read, and one that appeals to logic as the ruler by which American democracy is played out, and its relation to "ordinary citizens." 
I find Bill's books to be easy reads, which is important if he wants to reach a diverse audience. This book is a great motivator for personal growth. I finished it feeling much like I did after reading "The O'Reilly Factor." I wanted to improve myself and my life.  I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their interest in Bill's show on Fox News. I have a friend who dislikes Bill and she would benefit from reading this book. It's too bad her mind isn't open enough to give it a try. Don't make the same mistake. This book is extremely informative, motivational, and eye-opening 
If you are a fan of O'Reilly and are interested in his personal anecdotes and their place in his life's journey, then you'll enjoy this book. Don't expect any startling revelations, but do expect a good dose of common sense and a challenge to apply it in your own life 
Thought the book was great and factual. Certainly worth the time and money 
I'm like many of the statistical women described in the book who found themselves living well while married and then found themselves divorced and broke with little to show for years of sacrifice and hard work. It was then I discovered how dependent I had become on someone else to provide for my financial future. I call it "marital welfare" -- and I do agree that we are a culture of dependent creatures -- and this fact usually smacks a woman right in the face through circumstances she least expects. Part of rising above all of this has been a dawning awareness of how important it is to take the financial responsibility for my future into my own hands. Kim Kiyosaki has put into words what has already been placed in my heart -- it was the "you're on the right track" message that I needed to hear to further my resolve -- not just in finances but in every area where self-sufficiency needs to evolve. The good news is that I am remarried to someone who supports my financial plans, goals and dreams and shares in the excitement. This book does not give a step-by-step how-to, but what it does do is bring about a birthing process that can literally change your life because it provokes you to change how you VIEW your life. For many people, that's all it takes, and in that regard, this book has accomplished wonders 
Combine this information 1) statistically women live longer than men and 2) knowledge pays; that, in a nutshell, is the strongest argument for reading this book. Rich Woman is a great book for women of any age. Chapter by chapter, the author challenges the excuses that many women resort to for why they avoid dealing with financial matters. Packed with valuable and timely advice, this book will give any woman the confidence she needs to take ownership of her financial future. James Lange, CPA/Attorney and author of Retire Secure! Pay Taxes Later: The Key to Making Your Money Last as Long as You Do 
This was not the book I expected it to be, but it has won me over. Kim isn't saying that the mechanics of investing are different for women, but the motivations, rewards and value of investing groups are. That's why there's so many references to "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" etc. - go there to learn more about pure investing. This book is about defining yours goals, motivations and getting some tips - and if you DO SOMETHING you're probably going to succeed. The stories of the group of friends are sometimes distracting, but they serve an important purpose of letting you identify with situations - activating your empathy and getting the message across. Much more effective than a dry, objective HOW-TO book. I'm telling my friends about it 
Rich Woman is great for women who are just beginning to take control of their financial future and step out into the world of investing. It is set in easy to read "ladies lunch" type conversations, and addresses some issues that are unique to us as women. I have had the opportunity to work with Kim Kiyosaki, and she is the real deal. This book is not about selling anything- it was born out of years of seeing the urgent need for women to take control of their finances. 
Kim shows how investing for women can be very real and her approach is down to earth. She triggers thoughts with stories and examples shows the reader that no matter where you are at in life YOU CAN DO THIS 
I thought this book was great for my first book on investing. My husband and I are getting ready to invest in our first property and I wanted to be a part of our investments so I am starting with educating myself. This book was really inspirational and motivating which helps when taking a risk. It shows that anyone can invest no matter what income you have to start with. I would highly suggest reading this book if investing is something your thinking of doing. I hope you enjoy! 
Don't waste your time with Rich Woman. Just read Rich Dad Poor Dad. The book Rich woman is nothing but a advertisement for their books and seminars. F 
90% of this book is about Kim and her husband and how they got to where they are. There is very little information on how to actually go about investing. She's a good cheerleader, not so good on passing along good advice 
"RICH WOMEN is a great book for men!" Men, buy this book for the women in your life. Women have the potential to be excellent business people and with training and practice can beat men at their own game. Most have a subtle advantage over men and don't have to deal with the big ego problems of having to, "know it all." They just want to be winners and successful. Many just don't know where to start or how to get help. RICH WOMEN is a great start and savvy guide to financial freedom written for women 
This is a good read. This is what happens when you work hard at something and belive in yourself, just like Tavis has 
I am white, grew up in a small Ohio town with no blacks, went in the Marine Corp, my first exposure to the black community you might say then spent a couple decades in Corporate America as our country has moved along from the sixties and the appropriate black activities of the time. I have to say this book is a pleasent surprise. It has no big discussion on the whites that cause all their problems, it is just a downright honest book about one life lived well. Sometimes Tavis arrogance comes through and I imagine there are those along the way that would have some say about that but it doesnt matter. This book outlines a black success story against incredible odds but more importantly it is an American success story. You can all learn alot about growing up black and growing up impoverished in America as I did from this. More importantly Tavis outlines how we can forgive and love one another which is most important. Great book and a greater person. 
Tavis is a man that puts God first and he has never made him last. The book is truly remarkable. Just when I thought he had reached his highest potential, here he goes again. Just like the man, the book intrigues the mind to think outside of the box. He tells of his strengths his weaknesses, his successes, his failures and each lesson that was learned along the way. Keep it coming Tavis, keep intriguing the mind to think. This is story about how he became the man he is today....! I just gave my teenage son the book and i will be purchasing copies for each of the young men in my family. 
The most creative power given to the human spirit is the power to heal the wounds of a past it cannot change. We do our forgiving alone inside our hearts and minds; what happens to the people we forgive depends on them. The first person to benefit from forgiveness is the one who forgives. Forgiveness happens in three stages: we rediscover the humanity of the person who wronged us; we surrender our right to get even; and we wish that person well. Forgiveness is a journey; the deeper the wound, the longer the journey. Forgiveness does not require us to reunite with the person who broke our trust. We do not forgive because we are supposed to; we forgive when we are ready to be healed. Waiting for someone to repent before we forgive is to surrender our future to the person who wronged us. Forgiveness is not a way to avoid pain but to heal the pain. Forgiveness is the only way to be fair to ourselves. Forgivers are not doormats; to forgive a person is not a signal that we are willing to put up with what he does. Forgiveness is essential; talking about it is optional. When we forgive, we set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner we set free is us. When we forgive we walk in stride with the forgiving God. 
After I read Sen. Obama's book, I chanced to check out what other black writers were writing. That lead me to Tavis Smiley s What I know For Sure, and The Proper Criticism of Some Decent People, by Dr. Theophilus Green. Obama's critique of American politics and Dr. Green's evaluation of black American politics and their leaders, combined to give me perhaps the most comprehensive review of modern American politics that I have ever read. After reading Smiley's book, I had a more personal perspective, and most certainly after reading his Covenant with Black America. What I found most telling about Sen. Obama's book was his honesty and straight forwardness. Dr. Green's book was honest in an irreverent, directness that stimulated as much thinking about America as it did the definition of American. Smiley's book wrapped it up with a personal reflection on all that was hoped for, dreamt for and needed to have happen. All three are must reads, preferably at the same time. 
What I Know for Sure is that Tavis Smiley's testimony and transparency through this book was a refreshing read. He is a prolific speaker and a voice for this generation. I applaud him for allowing us to share intimately into his life. I was deeply moved by his honesty in retelling the experiences that shaped the man we now see today. The candidness expressed in each chapter allowed us to witness the forces that birth his purpose and propelled his drive, ambition, and advocacy. His love for people was greatly evident. This book is a must read not just for African-Americans but for anyone who has faced adversity, challenges and trying circumstances in life. Greatly inspiring 
Who is Tavis Smiley? Initially Tavis' prominence in the media led me to think this guy was just a 'talking-head' - a person simply trying to find a means to move up in this world. However, years have shown me I was wrong.  Tavis Smiley is a man of conviction.  I have witnessed his passion and service and have been an indirect recipient of its affects. His book "What I Know For Sure" shows that he is indeed a man of great determination and drive - and yes, he is in fact trying to go somewhere. Yet, the beauty of the story and his life is that he desires to take a nation of folks with him.  I greatly appreciate Tavis for having the courage to share his trials and triumphs with the public. It was refreshing to read a story where a Black man's battles were not with drugs or sex, but with deeper elements that tend to birth destructive surface habits that deceivedly garner too much of our attention.  The deeper issues are: How do we navigate our spirituality and poverty, or better yet, our spirituality and our God given gifts? Is one married to the other? Does one negate the other? Are there gifts to be used in religious confines, and then others meant for worldly consumption? How do we as African Americans mature in mind to understand that "God so loved the WORLD..." that he gave gifts? Gifts to be used to open college doors, and business opportunities, and platforms for change -for a freeing of His people...  "What I Know For Sure" is a great, easy-flowing story. I am requiring my 17 year old son to read it. I will give it as a gift to my nephews, brother, and brother-in-law. I plan to send it to my childhood friend who is now in prison. In fact, it is my hope that everyone who struggles to define, understand, or find evidence of " Black MAN" in today's society, might read this book, read "Yellow Black" by Haki Madhubuti, "The Pact" by Davis, Jenkins and Hunt, and Denzel Washington's new book, "A Hand To Guide Me."  These books speak to contemporary situations, and will undoubtedly prove to be as relevant for this period of time as "Souls of Black Folks", "Black Boy" and "Invisible Man" were for theirs.  Great work Tavis! 
I've always dug Tavis Smiley big time. I've always respected his Vast Knowledge to communicate direct do his thing. this Book takes you back to his upbringing. this Book pulls no punches about what he dealt with as a Young Black Man growing up in a Household of a Large family,also dealing with getting whippings(this was the Pre-Pre Time-Out Era which back in the day only applied to Sports Games)and dealing with his own self in the Process. everybody sees the Success,but not many people are aware of the struggle this Man had to endure many lasting images he had to deal with Mentally. I applad Brother Tavis Smiley for not being afraid to settting the Record Straight. this Book will hit you in so many ways on your own upbringing it might be close to your own story. I can relate to it big time.Tavis doesn't back down to BET or NPR Either.Tavis without a doubt is one of the most Important Voices out here. he keeps it real Book is very direct 
Barbara A. Nadel. FAIA creates the resource for architects for security design. Nadel empasizes owners assembling a security team at the beginning of a project when design professionals can plan for and budget good security strategies. Most of the text is very informative and uses examples as well as compiles articles developed by security consultants in the field. In this unparalleled book Barbara A. Nadel, FAIA creates the source for security design. A must have resource for all architects, planners, landscape designers, lighting consultants and engineers in a security conscious design era; post 9/11 
Since 9/11, the security industry has been evolving. The need for standards in the industry is imperative and this book discusses a varity of industries and their standards of care. This book is a great reference for anyone in any industry that is looking for information on security. Building Security: Handbook for Architectural Planning and Design is a must have. 
Nadel's Building Security: Handbook for Architectural Planning and Design is the final word on the creation a safe built environment. From broad case study analysis (Oklahoma City) to engineering details and protocol checklists, this tome provides owners, the entire design team and safety officials all the information they need to secure a structure and plan for responses to incidents. Building Security is simply the best work on the subject out there and I highly recommend it. 
I'll never look at my clients' nursing home facilities the same as I did before I read this handbook! I'm a healthcare attorney, not an architect. There are some chapters that are more applicable to my role with clients than others; nevertheless, I found this book extremely informative and thought provoking. Clearly this book was a labor of love for Ms. Nadel. 
If you've read any of the reviews, you'll already know how influential this book has been for decades now. I was fortunate enough to first read it when I discovered a 3rd edition original printing at a budget bookstore: what a find! This edition stands out, as the accompanying "Action Pack" section is a real hands-on guide into how to read the book, how to discover more about yourself, and how to apply what you learn. I carry around in my backpack a set of 3x5 cards with notes and thoughts captured while reading the book. That way I can revisit certain areas "on the fly". You'll probably want to do something similar. At any rate, if you get this edition, make sure you find the first page of the Action Pack section, and follow from there, as it gives you very specific instructions on how to go through the book. If you only purchased one book in your lifetime on self-development, and it was this book, you'd be in fine shape 
I just finished Think and Grow Rich for the 3rd time. The first time I read it, I was a twenty something and didn't fully grasp it; the next time I read it, I was a forty something, and I reaped great benefits by implementing these principles into my life and career; now, I am almost sixty, and I finally understand the book. Napoleon Hill was clearly correct when he stated that it is very seldom that a young person can grasp the master keys to riches. After completing this book for the third time, I am looking forward to an even more satisfying and productive future... I highly recommend this book to those who want to find the keys to success and riches as well as peace of mind. There should be a college curriculum built around this book. In today's U.S. society, the concepts of self-determination and individualism are dying concepts. This book will teach you how to use your mind to achieve anything that you desire. Everyone desiring success and riches should read this book... Please do not take offense to the masculine references contained in the book. It should be remembered that this book was completed almost 70 years ago and society was "different". It's principles apply to both genders and all races and ethnic groups 
"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve." -Napoleon Hill If you asked me to recommend to you the single best book I have ever read, my answer would be a very definite "Think and Grow Rich". First published in 1937, this is the end product of two decades of research conducted by Napoleon Hill. His research started when Andrew Carnegie (the steel tycoon who was then the richest man on earth) gave him the assignment of organizing a Philosophy of Personal Achievement. Hill, who was a poor journalist, armed with just an introductory letter from Carnegie, set out to interview over five hundred successful people including Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman, William Wrigley Jr. and Charles M. Schwab. Hill then revealed the priceless wisdom of his research in the form of the thirteen steps to success (in Think and Grow Rich) and the seventeen principles of success (in courses and lectures he conducted). The concepts taught by Napoleon Hill transformed my life. Some of these include developing a definite purpose, building a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA), channeling the power of the sub-conscious mind and dealing with adversity. Everything he wrote about or talked about is thought provoking. He was wise, humble and funny. His philosophy is universal; he did not mix it with religion. The riches he referred to were more than money, for the Philosophy of Personal Achievement can be applied to anything in life. This is a classic, and hence the examples are old (not to be confused with outdated). But they are as relevant today as they were in the early twentieth century. Here is an example from T in the chapter on Desire: On the morning after the Great Fire of Chicago (1871), a group of merchants on Chicago's State Street went into a conference to decide whether to rebuild their stores or leave Chicago. All but one decided to leave. The merchant who decided to stay pointed a finger to the remains of his store and said "Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the world's greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down." His name was Marshall Field and his store still exists, and in Hill's words is "a towering monument to that state of mind known as a burning desire." I lived in Chicago from 2002 through 2004 and worked three blocks away from this impressive store on State Street. Sometimes I would visit it or stand outside it to derive inspiration and be reminded of the power of desire. It is amazing that Hill describes "burning desire" with a story based on the Chicago Fire. There are thousands of self-help books out in the market and hundreds of self proclaimed "gurus" who have made a living by copying the wisdom in Hill's books. As I went through some of those books I realized that there was not much in them that Hill had not already written about. I recommend quality over quantity. Instead of reading through many books, I recommend that you study the following works of Hill and internalize his wisdom: 1. Think and Grow Rich (1937) - I recommend the Action Pack edition, 2. Napoleon Hill's Keys to Success : The 17 Principles of Personal Achievement - this is an excellent guide to his principles, 3. Your Right To Be Rich [Unabridged] - this consists of 12 hours of live lectures covering the 17 principles, that Hill conducted in Chicago in 1954. By internalizing, I mean studying in depth - analyzing the ideas, making notes and summaries. I own more CDs by Hill, but I believe that these 3 items make the perfect study plan on the Philosophy of Personal Achievement. Some have criticized Hill's work by stating that his research was unscientific. They pass him up for Jim Collins (whose "Good to Great" dedicates 76 out of its 300 pages to research methodology and notes that hardly anybody ever reads) or Marcus Buckingham (whose "First Break..." similarly uses 25 pages for Gallup's Meta Analysis and what not). These people don't know what they are missing. I am greatly indebted to Napoleon Hill. The purpose of my writing this is to spread awareness of his work so that more people can benefit from it. This, I believe is the best way in which Hill would have liked to have been repaid.

I have had the isbn 0449214923 version of this book for a number of years and as it has travelled many miles it's got rather tatty. So I purchased this edition. Within the first 1/2 hour of reading, the spine split into two. Also, it is a shabby printing as the subheadings in bold have the centers of the characters filled in. I recommend the book, but not this edition/printing 
I have always taken good notes and tested myself on anything that I have read to make the material come to life. After reading Think Grow Rich and after reading so many positive reviews here, I decided to go out and buy this one as well. To tell you the truth, it was sort of anticlimatic. The exercises were good, but I pretty much figured that out for myself without the guide. I had already read Think Grow Rich at least a dozen times so thought I knew this material cold..and I did. BUT....when I went to the back of the book and took the 5 examinations, I had to admit that I knew what Napolean Hill wanted as answers but couldn't truly say in all honesty that I was where I needed to be or wanted to be in the five categories listed. So I went to work on my weak areas which I thought I didn't have before reading this book. This part of the book alone was for me, well worth the price of buying this version of Think and Grow Rich. I think a lot of people will benefit from the Action Pack because so many people I know will read the book once and think they've got it. The action pack will make you roll up your sleeves, clear the mental cobwebs, learn the material but even more importantly, make the material bring out the qualities inside you that lead to success 
I am a huge fan of Napolean Hill and this book in particular. This book is Think Grow Rich PLUS an action guide. When I first read the book Think Grow Rich, I got great results. But when I used this book with the action guide, my results were greatly magnified. 
Seems that anyone who's anyone worth knowing has read this old classic. That usually sets me off - I don't like being mainstream. Yet so many successful entrepreneurs told me to read it and I knew I'd be spending hours at the beach last summer anyway so I snatched up a copy. This book was the start of a new way of thinking for me. A new way to think about business, relationships, money, my own power and the world. The exercises in the back were at times cumbersome (I was really hoping that this book was an actual workbook that I could pen in.). Even still the exercises were a necessary part of my growth. I suggest everyone should get the Action Pack instead of the standard edition. 
The Think Grow Rich Action Pack is a phenomenal book that will help you to reach your maximum potential, achieve your goals, build your character and develop your leadership skills. The Think Grow Rich Action Pack is a great guide on how to "personalize" Think Grow Rich to your walk in life. I discovered Think and Grow Rich when I read Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion and International Boxing Hall of Famer Ken Norton's autobiography "Going the Distance." Norton shared in his book that he read Think Grow Rich and it changed his life. Norton's book states he was prescribed to read Think Grow Rich after he suffered his first boxing defeat and had to start over. He then went on to beat Muhammed Ali for the title. Norton shares in his book that he read Think Grow Rich repeatedly during his career and he became a stonger person for it. 
I still have my original copy. It's very tattered and worn after the 100s of hours of reading and re-reading, but it remains an important part of my life. This book has had the most significant impact on my life than any other book I've read (not including the BIBLE). Many years ago I fell into some very difficult times. I went from riches to rags. By a stroke of luck, this book jumped off the bookshelf and saved my life. It lifted me up, got me positive and helped me reshape who I was. It has been my source of strength ever since. It taught me how to take my dreams and make them a reality. How I could focus my energy and teach myself how to become what it was I dreamed. It taught me how I could organize my life, make a decision about what I wanted to do with it, and go after my goals with persistence. Itstead of being depressed, I could establish a state of mind that could overcome any obstacle and go after any desire with confidence. Napoleon Hill interviewed the most successful people of his time and extracted the secrets that made them rich, successful and happy. I highly recommend this book. If you're down in the dumps, it will lift you up. If you're rich in money, but unhappy, it will show you how to refocus and join the riches of money with happiness. Or even if your life seems perfect, it will revitalize you and help you realize the potential you didn't even realize you possessed. So pick up this book. The cost is insignificant when you see what it does for your life. It will change it forever. And the action pack reinforces the concepts and helps you apply them to your life. 
After graduating from college I questioned my education. I guess I wasn't happy with the path that I chose. Too bad that I realized that right after I graduated, however just by chance I read Michael Gerber's The E Myth Revisited. The book completely geared me towards a different goal. Instead of going into education I decided to pursue the idea of starting my own business. That's when I decided to research books about success and what it takes. I stumbled upon Think and Grow Rich, I read all the reviews on Amazon.com, and instead of buying the book I decided to rent a copy from the library. I took few days to read it. Right after I finished reading it, I decided to purchase my own copy. It was possibly the most important decision I've made in my life. I'd like to claim that the book changed my life, in addition I read several other books written by Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, Jeff Keller and many more. However, I found that Think and Grow Rich served as a template to everyone else's work. Napoleon Hill presented his discoveries quite clearly, and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone's life. Ever since then, I've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of St. Louis. I'm proud to say that I couldn't have done it without the help of Napoleon Hill and his book Think and Grow Rich. This book was not only written to get rich, but also to change people in a positive way. Whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete, this book will definitely help you achieve any goals. Like Napoleon Hill said, "Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve," these are the words to live by! This book should be your starting point towards life's riches, you can then follow up by reading Napoleon Hill's other books, as well as books written by other authors on the same topic 
I am a personal growth coach and I do some work in the area of sexuality. There are many people that are inhibited around their fantasies or feel guilt for having normal sexual feelings. I feel this book is useful because it provides a wide array of different types of fantasies that are common in themes in the female population. This can be a very helpful book to help people normalize their feelings of shame and guilt around their innocent fantasies. I also like that this book provides some psychological interpretation of female fantasies and is organized around themes. The content is erotic, but tasteful. On the other hand, people's authentic experience is captured and the content is not necessarily sugar-coated. I think this book will appeal more to women than to men. Among other things, it will help women to realize that they are not unique in having certain desires that they don't fully understand or want to have happen in real life. Two other great books that describe the psychology of sex and sexual fantasy are THE EROTIC MIND by Jack Morin and THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE by David Buss 
If we can get beyond the fact that all of us guys get super turned-on by this and love to read these fantasies, then we can objectively take a look at this book. What is interesting to note is that women down deep have the same drives, basically that men do. They may have been taught to repress them or express them differently, but we are sexual beings-all of us male and female. Nancy Friday does a great job of reminding us of that fact. Yes, some things you read here are shocking and maybe unsettling, but remember, she just took the information sent to her and compiled the book. I found this book fascinating for many reasons 
I found this book on a shelf at a library over 10 years ago. It was a hardcover book and the artwork was rather nondescript. What I browsed through within though is seared into my conscience and really opened my eyes to the world of female lust thought. I admit, NOTHING has ever aroused me like some of the entries inside - even hardcore [...]. It's all about intent, motive, desire. Is it real? Is it sincere? You could put the most flat out gorgeous woman in front of me and she might not have anywhere near the erotic intensity of a woman who society might deem "less than perfect" looks-wise. It almost always is the look in her eye, or the pitch of her voice, something that conveys warmth, you know? More than anything, seeing and feeling a palpable HUNGER, an aching so deep it hurts for satisfaction. I found a lot of that energy in this book and it was DIVINE. I wish Ms. Friday would release another compilation of this material 
Let's be straight. This is a book full of real people's sexual fantasies. It's not guided by some moral code the world imposes on us, nor is it subject to the same code when being read. It is individual's fantasies. Escapism, exploration of the mind where boundaries have no place. The reader is supposed to have reactions evoked, because some of what happens within a world of fantasy is so outside the real worlds acceptability that when looked at form the real world, it seems alien, and stimulates our ingrained sense of right or wrong. It gives an insight into the women who've contributed psyche, often how women as sexual beings have been repressed by the world around them, and unable or unwilling because of their confines to rebel in the real world, have conjured in their minds elaborate and amazing ways to escape mentally, which in turn, has enabled the conscious self to accept who they are, and apply their OWN morals and values to their lives, rather than ones given to them by their parents and religions and upbringing! An uplifting book for those who aren't afraid to explore themselves 
I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me. It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible. If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge. I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire. 
These three works are wonderful in themselves, and fascinating in their anticipations of Crowley's visionary masterpiece--and one of American fiction's handful of true masterpieces--Little, Big (1981). Perpetually warring factions on a distant planet are thrown out of equilibrium when a stranger appears among them...The Deep is a gnostic parable ingeniously hidden in a just-this-side-of-cheesy '70s sci-fi adventure novel plot. Its secret concern is with the origins of the Renaissance, historically and as an emblem of personal rebirth. The ending is really, really something. Beasts hides itself a bit also. In the dying America of a future Earth, biologically engineered man/animal hybrids attempt to throw off their chains and find a place in the world. They are variously aided and opposed by the novel's human beings, each of whom proves to be a very much distinct creature as well. It is a story of violent revolution, but also of our turning toward one another, from truly different perspectives, for the first time. Engine Summer shrugs free of all adventure plot conventions and delivers the first dose of full Crowleyan power. It's a hair-tearing shame that this most perfect of books is buried away in genre fiction, to be sniffed at absently by seekers of pedestrian escapism now and then, but discovered by so few of the millions who would love it...The setting is the future again, but who cares? Well, Crowley, in a sense: the question here is what remains when all else has passed away. A young man chases a lost love and lost civilization across a world of painfully mortal beauty. Where beauty and pain merge completely we are completely alive, we learn. Words stop, there; but, somehow, not Crowley's. And then Little, Big... 
Again I bought this book because of the outstanding reviews and am sadly disappointed. This is junk. Not one of the three stories is entertaining. The only positive I can say is that it has a similar feel to Gene Wolfe but that is like saying an ant is similar to a man because it has legs, so just forget it, this blows 
Crowley has made a career of being one of the most underrated masters of American fiction. Only one book, "Little, Big," has ever been a modestly big seller. His "Aegypt" tetrology, not yet complete, is a piece of visionary work on an epic scale. His only fault is that the writing is unclassifiable, so it has fallen between every conceivable crack. Bad for sales. "Engine Summer" is the first of his novels, though the last of the early three to be published. It leaves the others behind as a work of astonishing originality and almost hallucinogenic vision. (Crowley admits that his first draft was written at a time when he was smoking a lot of, well, you know.) In this elegant and beautifully understated work (if it goes a little slowly at first, stick with it: it will sweep you away) the Crowley themes have a true beginning: a world constantly transforming in which the only way that the history of the human as the strangest of races can really be kept alive is through the stories we tell. He has an enormous talent for inducing laughter of utter delight and rolling tears simultaneously. His gift is in his humanity, his innate understanding of the deep pathos and utter ridiculousness of being self-conscious creatures in a world that is not and will never be wholly comprehensible. Thus it is our stories that keep us sane. Barely. The future which he envisions (this is not the kind of future fantasy that even pretends to forsee the world as it might actually turn out) is one in which the split between the natural, instinctual half of our human dichotomy and the mental, synthetic one actually become separate species, with no real capacity to comprehend the other. How this plays out through his richly detailed imagination and alchemical control of the Engish language is something to be experienced, not described. The narrative device, which leaves us guessing until a breathtaking revelation at the end, is alone, worth the price. Get this book. Read it. Please. The later Crowley may be greater, but never more brilliantly imagined than this. Oh, yeah. "Beasts" and "The Deep" are mighty fine, too 
John Crowley is a treasure. He combines gorgeous, haunting writing with a wealth of intelligent, thought-provoking ideas. Otherwise collects his three early novels, all nominally science fiction but so far from the stereotypical forms of that genre as to almost deserve their own literary classification. In each of these small but perfectly formed jewels, Crowley demonstrates complete control of his medium. In barely 200 pages, he creates and destroys worlds, makes us fall in love with his characters, and leaves us wanting more. Crowley's first novel, The Deep, takes place in a semi-mythical world in the throes of a war of succession. Two factions, the Reds and the Blacks, are vying for the throne, and another group, the Just, have sworn to end the tyranny of all ruling houses. Into this war comes a visitor, something not entirely human. Due to injuries (or perhaps malfunctions) it is unable to carry out its mission, and ends up being drawn into human existence. There is a dissonance between the two halves of the story - the medieval palace intrigue and the visitor's search for its purpose - that keeps The Deep from being a complete novel, but still one can't help but marvel at Crowley's skill. Other authors writing about elaborate wars of succession and courtly machinations will sometimes fill thousands of pages without creating anything close to Crowley's instantly believable world and sympathetic characters. Although it is ultimately not a completely successful novel, The Deep is beautiful and engaging. My personal favorite, Beasts, takes place in the not too distant future. America has fractured into numerous autonomies which eye each other nervously and prepare for war. Some decades previously, genetic experiments gave rise to animal-human hybrids, who now walk the earth as outcasts. In Beasts, Crowley examines the animal in the human and the human in the animal by assembling a diverse and fascinating cast of characters - a human-lion messiah and the humans who flock to his call, a super-intelligent dog trying to fight his devotion to the race that made him, a tame hawk set loose in the wild. Crowley examines the two-edged sword of intelligence and asks - is it better to be tame or wild? Some reviewers have complained about Beasts' sudden ending, but to me it seems right, as the question can never be answered and there's already so much in the book to ponder. Engine Summer is my least favorite of the three books. Its protagonist, Rush That Speaks, lives in a post-industrial world only vaguely aware of the technological society that preceded it. Driven by wanderlust, curiosity, and love, Rush leaves his comfortable home and ventures out into the world. Through his eyes, we discover the different societies and ideologies that have arisen in the wake of some great destruction, and eventually Rush brings his wisdom to the survivors of that destruction. Although as beautiful as the other two books in its prose, I found Engine Summer cold and uninvolving. There was no plot to speak of, and no characters that I could care for. Otherwise is a good introduction to Crowley's writing (although new readers might also begin with Little, Big, arguably Crowley's masterpiece). These three short novels epitomize his strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and clearly demonstrate the promise that he's since lived up to. A reader emerging from the depths of these three worlds can have no doubt - John Crowley is a treasure 
I really am finding this book to be chocked full of valuable information on gettings ones art career in motion. I recommend this one for anyone thinking of moving past the hobby stage of their career 
WOW, WOW, WOW. Get this book! This has (just about) everything you need to be professional. The only thing I didn't like is that most of the resources listed were geared to NYC residents, but there was good direction as to how to locate similar services in your area. I especially liked the opening that deals with how artists are helping to perpetuate their own "starving artist" myth, and the ways to stop that. It made me realize that I am the one standing in the way of my own success! Well, no more--thanks to Caroll--I am taking all of the steps listed. I wish my graduate school had this information available 
this book was really helpful in understanding how much marketing work is involved with doing art. it's a little intimidating to think that you will need to write press-releases for everything you do. but thats' the truth i guess if you want to play the game. that is if you want to play by and set your own rules instead of just being a tool for the whims of gallerists and dealers 
I have never been one to read self-help books, but, as an artist just beginning to market my work, I felt helpless and uninformed. I am so glad I bought this book - Ms. Michels demystifies the business process in a pragmatic and often humorous way. I now feel I have a clearer picture of where I'm going and how I'm going to get there, as well as having more confidence in myself and less awe of the art world. This book will be well-used as I move forward 
I thought this book was helpful in how to write a cover letter and a resume. I haven't read the whole book yet but so far it's decent 
This is an absolutely essential book for all artists with all of the nuts and bolts information you need to prceed with art as your full time career. The authors attitudes and insights into the "myth o f the artist" are nothing less than inspiring. The only criticism I would have is that several of the weblinks in the very extensive appendix are dead, including the link for the authors site! But all in all a MUST have 
Book came on time in good condition 
Everything was fine. It arrived very soon 
This book is a great basic book for entry into the art business. It has alot of good reference materials in the back and good advice 
For an artist who is serious about selling my work and making money, Caroll's accumulation of contacts, facts, sources and a collection of years of experience is helping my work enhancement and marketing expertise. An artist must pay attention to the experiences of colleagues who have been successful in this business. This book provides the tools to make an art career financially productive 
One could right an honest right-wing history, I suppose, by sticking to the facts. Paul Johnson's propaganda is simply lying. As just one instance of this, Paul Johnson assures the reader that President Johnson was reluctant to escalate the Vietnam War. He further assures us: "There is no evidence, as was later alleged, that the incident was contrived, to get America deeper into the war." And further: "But congress, by an overwhelming majority, passed . . . the "Tonkin Gulf Resolution' authoring the President to take vigorous measure to protect US forces." One would think that if he going to make such a claim that he should at least explain why the Pentagon Papers so explicitly state that the official account of the Tonkin Gulf attack was a deliberate deception. In the October HARPER'S article, "The Next War," Daniel Ellsberg claims to have had drawerfuls of critical working papers, memos, estimates, and detailed escalation options revealing the evolving plans of the Johnson Administration for a wider war, expected to commence soon after the election." Though far more inclined to trust Ellsberg than Johnson, either Paul or Lyndon, I admittedly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth, but I have not heard that the Pentagon Papers were not genuine. When Johnson is not simply lying, he uses facts to support a viewpoint which he himself must know to not be true. "Support for intensifying the war was always greatest among the under thirty-fives," (at least prior to November 1968, "by which time the decision to get out had already been taken)." (By whom)? Considering that the young had been nursed on heroic World War II movies, trained in blind "patriotism" and educated in such a manner as to preclude questioning governmental authority, what else was to be expected? Once we woke up to what had been done to us, we, the American People, most definitely lost our stomach for the war. With "historians" like Paul Johnson, it is not surprising that another generation has been duped. (Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA BATTLES THE BEELZEBUBIAN BEASTS OF THE BIBLE) 
In this work, Paul Johnson gives a historical overview of the 20th century, from the 1900's to the 1980's. In this work Johnson doesn't just recount historical events, but also interprets and in many places, offers a very strong view on them. Being both a Catholic and a political conservative who strongly believes in the existence of a well to do middle class, Johnson is searingly scathing of much of 20th century Communism, as well as socialism and other Leftist movements. He is also highly critical of many Communist dictators, such as Stalin, Lenin, Mao, and Pohl Pot, who all effectively wiped out the middle classes in their country, and also the third-world revolutionaries like Chinua Achebe who argued strongly for violence to be used for political ends. In the conclusion, Johnson reserves his poison for the advocates of applying ideas from modern evolutionary biology to social problems, feeling this will result in several social disasters (however one can't help but feel Johnson's Catholicism at work here). Johnson is as usual not afraid to speak his mind when he feels it is right to do so. In some works, this is a weakness, but in this one, I feel many of his points are spot on, especially when it comes to the awful tyrannies of too-powerful states, who were only too willing to wipe out entire sections of their people for political aims. The price of political goals must never be genocide 
An extremely entertaining and readable book. A pleasing eye for the small detail, an efficent prose style. He has extreme selective memory - the Spanish Civil War or Castro's Cuban revolution with no mention of crushing poverty just one example. In some cases he's flat out wrong - Cuba a 'rich country' under Batista. His dismisal of Ghandi smacks of racism. In general he has come to praise the colonialist English, Vichy France, Franco and Nixon; to savage FDR, JFK and labor unions. Much of his savaging is Monday morning (or Wednesday afternoon) quarterbacking. He claims 'moral relativism' as the scourge of the twentieth century while turning a blind eye when events don't fit his 'white mans burden' theory of post-colonialism. He blaims Leninism for everything but earthquakes and is ruthless in his hatred of state communism, state capitalism. He swings numbers around to trash post-war labor enough to deserve Twain's over used saw: Lies, damned lies and statistics. Blind of course to the morally relative shenanigans of Reagan and Thatcher, he doesn't come off as a revisionist so much as a self important old man settling old scores (take that, Roosevelt!) while remaining blissfully ignorant of the grey areas around his heros. However, he can write and he knows his subject. With less axes to grind, this would be a great book. He's unrelenting in his hatred of the Bolsheviks and Nazis, and as I agree I find much of his real-politik analysis very interesting and in many cases accurate. There are much better surveys of the 20th century, Martin Gilbert's comes to mind as his right wing spin doesn't kick in until 1968, but for the flavor of the times this is a tasty read. Just don't take his opinions, or even some of his 'facts', at face value 
Paul Johnson is opinionated and a good writer and this history is very readable. "National Review" named it one of the top 100 books of the century and, although I'm not a political conservative, I found myself in agreement with much of what Johnson says. "Modern Times" begins with the end of World War I and focuses on the personality of actors on history rather than impersonal trends or philosophies of history. Johnson sums up his own philosophy with a quote from Alexander Pope: "The proper study of mankind is man." His opinion of the 20th century cast of characters is scathing more often than not. He trashes Woodrow Wilson -- a sound judgment in my opinion -- defends Harding, claims Coolidge was a good President, is lukewarm toward Hoover, considers Roosevelt frivolous and empty-headed, favors Truman, and adores Eisenhower. Churchill is his great hero. The totalitarians -- Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler -- are depicted as venal gangsters. Johnson is unflinchingly anti-Communist throughout, an opinion that proved sound when the rot of the Soviet Union and its satellites became obvious in the late 1980s. (The first edition of this book was published in 1983.) Nehru, Gandhi and many other third world personalities get tossed into the category of lawyer/politicians with little to recommend them as leaders of countries. Fault can be found with Johnson; minor errors of fact and questionable statements dot the book -- and he rushes breathlessly on without defending many of his opinions. However, if he argued them all out the book would be 10,000 pages long and dull as an airline steak knife. It is perhaps his tendency to be provocative that makes this history interesting -- as so many others are not. I found particularly informative Johnson's description of how the Cold War started and his view that Hoover and Roosevelt's policies prolonged the Great Depression rather than eased it. Many other interesting gems are hidden in "Modern Times." Read it. If you're a liberal you'll be infuriated now and then, but this is an intelligent and stimulating book about 70 years of the most violent and eventful century in the history of mankind. Smallchief 
This is how history should be written. The author thesis that "ism" has been the monkey on Mans back for the most of the 20th century is steel on target. This book has a lot for one to ponder on. 
William Manchester turned me on to 20th century narrative history with the Glory and the Dream and the Churchill biographies. I have been looking for someone comparable for years. Keegan, Gilbert, Schlesenger and others don't do it for me. Paul Johnson does. Johnson is not just a lively and entertaining writer. Like Manchester, he offers informed judgments and backs them up with facts. For anyone wanting to understand today's left/right dichotomy, there is no better tool than 20th century history. The state vs the individual, socialism vs capitalism, central planning vs the markets. It's all there. Today's politics is yesterday's politics. Nothing is new. What's amazing is that the same ideas keep getting recycled despite the judgment of history. Perhaps the most sorrowful aspect of today's society is our historical illiteracy. How can you understand the present without an understanding of the past? 
I'm trying to read all of Mr. Johnson's books, because this one was so good. Some are not available. MODERN TIMES is a sweeping history of the 20th century that should be read by students everywhere. Armed with the facts, they'd be less prone to falling for historical lunacy later on. Johnson writes from a point of view (as do all writers), but his perspective is clear, well reasoned and backed by facts. He is British, and sometimes his national bias shows through, but he lays out a history that squares with the perspective that time allows for. His histories make sense, and more than that, his use of the English language is just a marvel. Paul Johnson is the only living writer I'd care to meet in person. I love all his books and keep them on my shelf, but this was the one that had the most profound effect on my thinking. God bless him. I hope he lives to write many more books. Here's one Yank that has learned much from my favorite British cousin. 
I was given this book by a friend. I am here on Amazon to buy 8 copies to give to acquaintances I know will enjoy it as much as I did. It's amazingly thought-provoking. And apparently controversial, I had to write a review after I read the one that gave the book a low rating, though the reviewer admittedly hadn't read it. There's a reference to folks like that around page 750 referring to wayward 'intellectuals' at Smith and Stanford. 
Accurate "History" is always difficult for reasons that are obvious to anyone that has ever tried to either study it or write about it. Paul Johnson has blended a good balance between presenting the complexities of 20th century history with the relatively simple cause and effect relationship between certain leaders, movements, and policies and their results on the peoples of the world. The author has a moderate conservative bias, but he doesn't try to hide it like so many authors on both sides of the aisle. His research is thorough enough to force one to seriously consider his conclusions. All in all, this was a very enjoyable, interesting, and enlightening book and I would recommend it to anyone. 
"Night" is a frightening book written by a man who saw the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand. Elie Wiesel survived years of torture, malnourishment, and dehumanizing conditions as he was forced to travel from one concentration camp to the next during the height of Nazi control. He was separated from his mother and sister and never saw them again. He watched his father gasp his last few breaths before authorities took him away during the night and disposed of him in a crematorium. This book is a scary and very real. It is like reading the words of a young boy's diary- a young boy who is frightened and appalled at the acts of violence taking place around him; a boy who cannot understand why this is taking place but knows that he must reach for every ounce of courage within him to survive this living nightmare. The scenes Wiesel describes in this book will stir up all sorts of emotions in every person who reads them. Adults, kids, and even young babies are thrown into fire pits by the Nazis. Thirsty prisoners eat snow in the hope that it will provide some thirst quenching relief. Near- naked people are forced to sleep without any protection on frigid, snowy winter nights. Wiesel describes the events vividly; going from a naive youngster to a hardened prisoner as he is sent from one camp to the next. He is sometimes emotional at first. But after witnessing so much inhumanity he becomes emotionally numb to the injustice around him. The arrival of the allied forces brought an end to the nightmare for Elie Wiesel and other prisoners. Wiesel's family members were not so lucky and he dedicates this book in memory of the three of them. He never saw his mother or sister after they were separated from him and his father so there is no way to know how they died. No one will ever know exactly how each person perished and the author doesn't offer any predictions. It really doesn't matter at this point anyway. His immediate family is gone, dead at the hands of a government out of control. This book is short, but it packs a tremendous punch. It serves as a reminder of the potential brutality of some people. And it also serves as a tribute to the human spirit: A tragic book that is also full of hope; showing how one young man was subjected to one of the most terrible human tragedies in history and lived to tell his painful story. It's a powerful read and a page turner from beginning to end. 
what an honest author. he had a difficult life that most people would choose to forget rather than share. 
Beyond and essential read, Night speaks to the reader about fundamental questions at the heart of the human condition. A powerfully moving autobiography, the story of this teenager's journey through the most horrific death camps of Nazi Europe, strips away discussion of anti-semitism and hatred, to present the raw suffering of individual humans, stuck in situations beyond their control. From the establishment of a ghetto in Elie's home town of Sighet, the reader can only watch with growing horror as the young man and his family are swept up in the Holocaust. Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Gleiwitz: some of the most infamous places in modern human history, rise around Elie, as we watch him stripped of absolutely everything. The reader is swept along helplessly, as Hitler's "Final Solution" unfolds - death marches, starvation, selections, cattle-carts full of people, torture, floggings, mass-murder - and as Elie is gradually reduced to nothing more than a 'hungry stomach'. What will humans do to survive? How important is loyalty, trust, family, faith, when one is faced with the grim reaper? If we cannot even answer these questions ourselves, what chance did a 15-year old boy stand? Despite its horrific and heart-wrenching subject, "Night" is an essential read for absolutely everyone; something that once read will never be forgotten. 
this is a disturbing work in that it recounts a man's experience of the nazi death camps. Warning: this book will shake you up mentally, and emotionally. It is not for the faint of heart. Yet, it is a must read because of the exposure it gives to humanity at it's worst and humanity under it's worst 
The short novel Night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter, but because Elie Wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character. Generally considered autobiographical, the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only God, but his humanity as the Nazi machine ravages Europe. The novel itself deserves 10 stars. However, the original translation deserves -1. Wiesel's skill as an author is blurred by a clumsy translation. The worst part is when the translator chose the lighthearted "siesta" as a description of Wiesel's first sleep in the labor camp. There is a much better translation out today by Marion Wiesel, and its worth the extra few dollars. This book is more than worth reading; buy the better translation, and you'll understand why Wiesel deserved not just the Nobel Peace Prize, but also the Literature Prize 
No matter your religion, ethnicity or basic beliefs, everyone should read this book because it is about hamanity and how it can change from mundane to total hell for no reason. 
What more can be said which already hasn't of this extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man of courage? With 900+ reviews, I will not make this an overly elaborate review, as the book simply does not require it. Elie Wiesel's story is one of one man's courage, will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost; friends, family, belongings, even basic human dignity. What struck me more than anything else from his personal story was the retelling of the hanging of the three men (well, two men and one boy) while he was in one of the concentration camps. Millions perished, but the way the boy who suffered during the hanging stayed with me. His story is the story of millions who perished and who never got to tell their tale, and one of the few books I would call a must read. Different instances in the book I am quite sure will strike readers differently. One of the things which struck me and stayed with me was how he kept on looking for God, even amidst the enormity man sometimes will carry out on his fellow man. What also struck me was the woman on the train who was saw the flames at the camps even before they arrived. And the times he scolded and questioned himself and his ethics for even thinking selfish thoughts even though he was dying. I still think would I (could I?) do the same if I was in his terrible position? This book shows the worst of mankind, and sadly this terrible event known as the holocaust is not entirely unique in man's history since the freeing of Elie Wiesel. We have witnessed Rwanda firsthand in the 1990's, and have been told by world authorities that "this will never happen again." Yet in modern day Sudan(and North Korea, and Tibet.....), we see much of the same.....the world turning its back on millions of people. There may not be furnaces involved, but the crime of complicity through inaction is little different than a world which allowed human beings to be fed into furnaces. I guess the final question I come away asking from his book is "Will mankind ever learn?" 
Night is Wiesel's personal memoir, which relates his personal story before and during World War II, as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps. "Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never." I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable. If you somehow missed this in high school, pick it up, if you didn't, find it again. It's worth it 
I always wonder what makes a book a good story to nominate for a Pulitzer prize? Even though I knew NIGHT was about the holocaust I still wondered what would make this book a winner. My son had a copy of the book and loaned it to me. I read it in one sitting and not because it is only about 100 pages long, but because I was able to get under the skin of a man who endured unspeakable experiences and survived and found some humanity in all the horror. I love the last line of the book...priceless 
I read Michael Masterson's EarlytoRise e-zine at least once a week, more when I have time. So I thought I had a pretty good idea of what to expect from Power Persuasion. And it didn't disappoint. Without knowing a lot about Masterson's specific career path, I can guess that he's had a great number of successes in a number of different fields. I say that because the ideas and principles that he presents for persuading others seem to transend specific job situations, so I can only assume that he's used them within any business situation in which he's found himself. Obviously, if you have the ability to persuade others, you'll have a great source of power at your fingertips. Having never been one to try to browbeat anyone into taking my side in a discussion, I look forward to putting the more subtle aspects of Masterson's persuasion techniques to work for me. It'll be interesting to see where I am career-wise, in a year's time, to see if I have indeed been able to leapfrog up the corporate ladder putting Masterson's Power and Persuasion to work for me. 
Michael Masterson is one of my favorite writers. His book "Power and Persuasion" hits the nail on the head when he describes the characteristics of successful business leaders (especially in chapter five). He puts into words what I have learned and believed for years. I found his thoughts about establishing communication routines and following up on goals to be on target. Too many leaders try to micromanage their employees and business associates. His comments about true delegation and recognizing different expectations of individuals increase both the leader's power and the power of those they associate. It takes very little time to acknowledge someone's accomplishments while increasing that person's self-worth. The result is a strong business team. Of course a regular routine of firing the weakest performers is best when needed. Pruning your hierarchy usually strenthens your business. And hopefully, those individuals will learn from the experience and succeed in another business. It is impossible to be liked by everyone, but strong leaders are usually respected. "Power and Persuasion" is a must read!!! Buy it now!!! I know several leaders who will receive Michael Masterson's book as gifts. Some who already have these skills and some who should learn and practice these successful business traits 
I did notice two typos, and I'm deducting a star for that, but the book was good -- an energizing, informative series of essays on leadership and communication in business and also in personal matters. Masterson uses a combination of personal experiences and research to support his arguments and insights. Most of what he said struck me as true. 
While I have not finished the entire book, I find it ironic that in a book on success and accomplishment there are at least 1 or 2 typographical errors in each chapter. While the business concepts appear sound, I am concerned about the lack of editing that apparently went into this book. I have also read Automatic Wealth by this author and there were few if any typos 
I expected a well written book from Masterson, and was not disappointed. Subjects covered from the full spectrum of what it takes to be a great leadser, from manners, to public speaking, to handling a crises or making a decision. While I've read hundreds of books on these subjects, I appreciated the fresh approach, and had several new ideas while reading. All great advice, more than a sales/persuasion book. a compendeum of leadership advice 
Michael Masterson is a money-making genius and the ideas he presented in Automatic Wealth have changed my life. As soon as I heard about the release of Power and Persusion I ran out and grabbed a copy... and was not disappointed. In P, Michael reveals the 2 universal rules for power and success that the world's most successful people seem to know and the rest of us missed out on... until now. Concise, easy-to-read, and extremely informative, Michael's P action plan will have you headed for success in no time. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to improve their personal and professional life 
Michael Masterson has had success in many businesses. One of them which I am part of. So I can tell you first hand how his leadership has had a profound impact on my business and personal life. And he has close to 400,000 Early to Rise readers who would probably agree. If your looking for a leadership book written by silver spoon CEO's who have never built a business from the gorund up, don't buy this book. However if you want actionable leadership advice that you can use in your everyday life, Masterson is the one who can teach you 
In the five years I've been following Michael Masterson's advice, my business has gone from an "idea" to an $8 million endeavor with 25,000 customers world-wide . . . 18 loyal, hard-working employees who surpass every challenge I give them . . . and a very healthy bottom line. I credit this success to the persuasion and leadership skills I've learned from Michael Masterson. I was amazed that he could put all his best strategies and advice in such an easy-to-follow format, but that's exactly what he did in Power Persuasion. 
This author was recommended to me by a breeder who competes with his dogs in hunting trials. The breeder is a firm believer in gentle methods and a trusting relationship. However, before I ordered the book,I read reviews of Mr. Wolters other books on Amazon and was prepared for the worst old fashioned, fear based, compulsion methods. I was wonderfully surprised! This is one of the finest books on choosing and working with very young puppies I have ever read (and I have read MANY). The author's experience and love of dogs is evident throughout, as well as his very clear admonishment of EVER being too harsh, or pushing any pup past his comfort level in exercises. The goal of the exercises with very young dogs is to build trust and confidence in the dog he will become. The book IS a little dated, very little is said about spay/neuter and crate training, and if there are any New Yorkers still tying their puppies to parking meters outside a store, they must not be very bright. But I thought the references to "Women's Lib" were cute. Its now VERY un-PC to say that to get the dog you want, you are best off with a young, good pup instead of an adult rescue, but its true. "Spanking" is also VERY un-pc. While the author refers to it, he also repeatedly states that NO harsh discipline of any sort is appropriate for young pups. Considering it was written THIRTY years ago, I think its brilliant. He was actually saying back then that people confuse dog breeds "train-ability" and "intelligence"! Mr. Wolter's experience is obviously tilted toward more "eager to please" breeds (most training books are) but because the book deals with very young puppies who haven't really developed into the more aloof specimins they may become, the advice is still excellent. Your loving tone may be enough for a middle of the road retriever pup, but keeping focus for more independent types may require a treat or two and this can easily be worked into the exercises. The author assumes that it is being read by a dog lover who will make loving decisions. The format is such that the book MUST BE READ, not treated like a recipe book where you can just open to chapter SIT STAY. But its a great read and his style is easy and clear. The heartbreaking true story of a sweet pup that was subtly pushed too hard should be required reading for anyone working with a puppy. And just to be clear, the "Protection" part of the title means bark like hell and be VERY scary on command, or when strangers approach and nothing more. The author feels very few people can handle pets that willingly attack and bite human beings. Its a good call and very expected from a dog lover who works with the public.  
A new approach which in fact is so easy but psychologically so difficult to accept. We have tried it out and and observed companies doing it since 16 years: to design and market low end products for the "Bottom of the Pyramid" (BOP) with high profit margins at low cost. We have developed a tool which we call MMP or Multiple Market Positioning which shows step by step how to implement this BOP idea successfully.

Tons of information backed by practical means. There is a ton of contemporary and useful information, statistics, charts, and analysis in this book. Equally important are the lists of specific steps and methods to implement these practical ideas. In "Bottom of the Pyramid," C.K. Prahalid details the critical realities that are witnessed and experienced in our radically changing world today. Especially for those that are living in LDC nations, or those on the lower end of the Per Capita Income scale, and/or those that are not experiencing sufficient economic growth. "BOP" is also quite relevant to high economic growth nations such as China and others, as these countries evolve (or is that devolve)? Several concepts are examined and advocated in "Bottom of the Pyramid by Prahalad. MFIs, and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) are relevant examples of purchasing parity. The author's concept of these populations being "value conscious by necessity" is real. As practical as the means to implement these concepts are in this book, often aided with specific models, examples, and instruction - it also takes - local people to accept it and do it. Many of the means and methods proposed for these areas at the BOP at times seem visionary and over-idealistic and also, too consumer-oriented. Prahalid does note the impediments, and is realistic about them. Supplying market needs is helpful to people by providing them access and affordability to the products they need. Beyond this, what can be achieved once these market niches are filled? Again, Prahalid uses a lot of charts, graphs, and stats to outline current challenges, and also the specific ways to address them. Prahalid lists logistics, payment methods, transportation, etc. One concept advocated is "creating the capacity to consume" in these poor countries, facilitated by the "single serving revolution." This single serving marketing approach is for sales of smaller packages of products instead of larger ones because lower income people in BOPs can't afford to buy larger packages and quantities and put them on the shelf at home for later use. Good value for a good product, with a good portion-to-cost ratio. Some small packaged single servings specifically listed by Prahalad are: "ketchup, tea, shampoo, coffee, and aspirin." Trivial products, many of us in the world use. Going farther and beyond these items would help, however: and, Prahalid does. In addition, his concept of the "Three As" is realistic in this approach to marketing: Affordability, Access, Availability. Some of the bureaucratic policies and private industries noted: citizen-centric governance, e-governance, the salt industry in India, landmines and prosthetics, eye care, rural kiosks, training, deliveries, and supply-chains, etc. Prahahlid noted the challenges to implementation. Ideas and words are quite different from implementation. (The doing.) This book's ideas can be helpful in certain circumstances and in many areas of the world. There is opportunity to implement these concepts, There are however, many hurdles to implementing them and achieving success. Will people at the BOP make the behavioral changes needed? Changing mentalities is where it starts. Are these recommendations, a form of cultural imperialism to some degree? One obstacle is corruption; it's rampant in many of these BOP countries. A high percentage of aid and investments are stolen throughout the world. Multi-national companies (MNCs) are often squeezed. Theft, corruption, and judiciary systems are built to work against foreigners and obstruct them, while these BOP nations depend upon them. NGOs acquire and spend a lot of money. What do they actually do? Not much, as a whole. NGO corruption and embezzlement is endemic. Aid is used by governments of the "developed world" to push forward its own agenda in these nations. Aid, is a carrot and a stick at the same time. In these nations there is no concern for individuals. Governments of BOP nations care about large corporations that dump millions of dollars of FDI into these countries. These MNCs often flush millions down the drain to get into these nations to get market share, reduced labour-costs, and to often export what they produce in BOPs nations to consumers in highly developed countries. Outsourcing is the latest motivator for the globalized competitive world where MNCs wield enormous power. Where do the 4 billion people Prahalad mentions as living on $2 USD per day fit into this? at the BOC (Bottom of the Company). Author Prahalid states: "The process must start with respect for Bottom of Pyramid consumers as individuals." Consumers? Target marketing aspirin, coffee, and shampoo. If foreigners can be the saviour, how long will they have to stay? This sounds like a business oriented financial quid-pro-quo with the time-consuming and often ineffective Peace Corps approach: "We can do things better than you can. So let us come. Let us in. We're doing you a favor, while we're furthering our interests at the same time. Mutual benefits to some degree, but what is the ratio? Different parties want access to the pie. If the entire pie grows and greater pieces and access of it are available to those who have less, those who have nothing or little, will in theory get a larger piece of the bigger pie. An element of Game Theory, perhaps. There are 6.3+ billion people on this planet, and the population is contueing to rise rapidly. Water and food will take prevalence over economic growth if something is not done about it. Lack of these basic necessities needed for basic survival will obstruct the prospect for economic growth and better quality of life. And, developed nations plunder world's the environment and harm the lives of those with less political and economic power. We live in one world, not three. What we do, more than ever, affects the entire population. This is a very positive book, with realistic means to achieve its aims. Ideas, facts, and realistic methods are superbly tied together in "Bottom of the Pyramid." The biographies at the back of the book add depth to the people involved. A Highly recommend book for everyone, and in particular those in Internationally Development, Intl. business, MNCs, and government. Great book. 
On the one hand this book is endorsed by Microsoft's Bill Gates and Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That ought give the prospective reader some idea of its value. On the other hand, it might be asked, what kind of book is this that purports to tell businessmen how to make money by selling goods and services to the poorest people on earth? After all, the poorest people that have any disposable income at all make something like two dollars a day. First question then is, how big is the market at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP)? Prahalad writes that China's per capita gross domestic product of $1000 really represents a dollar purchasing power parity (PPP) several times that, resulting in a $5-trillion dollar economy. He sees the Indian economy as being worth about $3-trillion in PPP terms. (p. 10) It's easy to see that even the apocryphal "two dollars a day" multiplied by two, three or four billion or so results in a whole lot of money. The second thing that might be asked is, is it really moral for the business world to turn its considerable powers of inducement and persuasion on people who have so little to begin with? What kind of person would aim to exploit those least able to afford the exploitation? The answer given persuasively by Prahalad is that by making products and services available to the poor, two good things will happen. First is the fact that goods and services hitherto unavailable to the poor will actually become available. Second, these products and services will increase their standard of living and allow them to "acquire the dignity of attention and choices from the private sector that were previously reserved for the middle-class and rich." (p. 20) How might this work? Presently people in the poorest neighborhoods in the world ironically often pay a premium for what little goods and services they get. Prahalad points out that this is because they are paying a "poverty penalty" which is the "result of inefficiencies in access to distribution and [because of] the role [played by]...local intermediaries." By "local intermediaries" he means the line of middlemen--some traditional, some corrupt, some both--that presently stand between the poor and their products and services. These middlemen add no value but have their hands out and therefore artificially increase prices for the people at the BOP. Products using modern distribution methods will undersell the old ways. Prahalad emphasizes targeting products precisely to the needs of the poor. BOP people are "value-conscious by necessity," he argues, and contrary to what might be assumed are "very brand-conscious." They are interested in "aspiration products"--brand names--since these products symbolize a higher standard of living and a better way of life. We can see this in our own poor neighborhoods where brand icons like Nike and Sony are almost worshiped. Prahalad notes that the "poor have unpredictable income streams. Many subsist on daily wages and...tend to make purchases only when they have cash and buy only what they need for that day." Consequently a good marketing strategy is to offer "single-service packaging--be it shampoo, ketchup, tea and coffee, or aspirin..." This may work I believe if, and only if, the products that big business makes available to the people at the BOP really do improve the quality of their lives. If they are persuaded to buy, say, cigarettes which they would not otherwise buy, clearly this will not improve the quality of their lives. If they are persuaded to buy soft drinks and other artificial "foods" consisting of empty calories, it's doubtful that they will benefit. But is all of this more "globalization trickle down"?--that is, the rich get richer and the poor get--well, somewhat less poor? Prahalad believes that turning the people at the BOP into consumers will raise their standard of living and in the long run eradicate poverty. He uses the phrase "creating the capacity to consume" as a means to this end. The unstated assumption behind Prahalad's idea (and the consumptive economy in general) is that there is great wealth in the world that only needs to be created by human ingenuity, and then efficiently distributed by the capabilities of the modern corporation. If we can find an energy source as cheap as oil and make a smooth transition to an oil-less economy, I think there is a good chance that Prahalad's vision will be realized. However, if we don't solve the coming energy problem, Prahalad's idea will gather dust and decay like so many abandoned SUVs alongside roads that we can't afford to repair. In a sense then, this could be a visionary book well ahead of its time 
As Prahalad explains in his Preface, he wrote this book to suggest and explain a new approach by which to solve the social and economic problems of 80% of humanity. His approach would mobilize the resources, scale, and scope of multinational corporations (MNCs) -- their investment capacity -- in a co-creative partnership with localized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in order to formulate and then implement "unique" solutions to the problems of 4 billion people who live on less than $2 a day at the bottom of the "pyramid" to which the book's title refers. "The process must start with respect for Bottom of Pyramid consumers as individuals. The process of co-creation assumes that consumers are equally important joint problem-solvers....New and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned. That is a challenge." Prahalad carefully organizes his material within three Parts. First, he provides a framework for the active engagement of the private sector and suggests a basis for a profitable win-win engagement. He identifies all manner of adjustments, accommodations, and (yes) sacrifices each of the "players" - MNCs, NGOs, and the poor themselves -- must be willing to make to ensure the success of the process. Next, he carefully and eloquently examines 12 case studies which involve a wide variety of businesses, each an exemplar of innovative practices, "where the BOP is becoming an active market and bringing benefits far beyond just products to consumers." All of the companies share the same concern: "They want to change the face of poverty by bringing to bear a combination of high-technology solutions, private enterprise, market-based solutions, and involvement of multiple organizations." As for Part III, it is provided as a CD which consists of 35 minutes of video success stories filmed on location in the BOP in India, Peru, Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela. Of special note is the fact that the various stories are told almost entirely from the perspective of BOP consumers, the so-called poor. As Prahalad points out, they get products and services at an affordable price, "but more important, they get recognition, respect, and fair treament. Building self-esteem and entrepreneurial drive at the BOP is probably the most enduring contribution that the private sector can make." As this book's subtitle correctly suggests, the ultimate objective is to eradicate poverty through profits...initiating and then sustaining what will be in fact, a win-win-win engagement of MNCs, NGOs, and the poor themselves. Of special interest to me is what Prahalad has to say about innovation for BOP markets which must become "value-centered" from the consumer's perspective. He identifies and then rigorously examines 12 principles for innovation in those markets such as "creating a new price performance envelope" and "education of customers on product usage." The BOP focuses attention on both the objective and subjective performances of the given product or service. Moreover, it must "also focus on the need for 30 to 100 times improvements in price performance. Even if the need is only for 10 to 20 times improvement, the challenge is formidable." Although Prahalad has a compelling vision, he has neither illusions nor delusions about the difficulty of fulfilling that vision when undertaking the "new approach" he recommends in this book. His vision is bold, indeed of global proportions. However, his feet are planted firmly on the ground at the bottom of an enormous pyramid, one whose complexities are exceeded only by the unprecedented entrepreneurial opportunities it offers to help solve the social and economic problems of 80% of humanity. Given the importance and the urgency of the various issues which Prahalad explores so brilliantly in this book, there seem to be no acceptable alternatives to the approach he proposes. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Vijay Mahajan and Kamini Banga's The 86 Percent Solution: How to Succeed in the Biggest Market Opportunity of the Next 50 Years and Kenichi Ohmae's The Next Global Stage: The Challenges and Opportunities in Our Borderless World. 
What is really good about this book is that it proposes a framework and then illustrates it with case studies. Aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth, improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models, distribution channels, product development or business processes.Having grown up and worked in India in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued. However, the case studies suggest this has changed and in many ways as far as India is concerned this is visible by strong anecdotal evidence. Also in many ways there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that people have realised that the government will not solve all that makes doing business difficult and have been using this kind of thinking as a driver for entrepreneurial business which also have a positive impact on the people at the bottom of the pyramid. Will The framework and ideas apply in all developing economies , specially with smaller populations ? This question is harder to answer and no doubt time will tell 
This is a well researched book in which Prahalad explores how disruptive innovation if harnessed properly can lead to huge profits for the corporations involved and high impact social well being. The key however is to get the ground breaking idea there is no set approach to getting the same, but he has done a good job of explaining how the idea can be scaled. The book will be phenomenonal if it could have concrete numbers and a comparative analysis of what the value add was by each idea. Certain approaches for decreasing costs etc. are explained but the lack of numbers hurts. All in all a great read. Mayank 
This is a fantastic book! 112 pages of theory and advice that really makes sense. You easily internalize the message! This is then followed by 5 VERY thorough and down to the detailed examples of how the theory has been practised by fore running companies in the field of 3rd world integration. It is very illustrative and initiate thoughts on how this could be followed up in your own compan 
This is the intense, profound, almost unbearably sad story of Swede Levov, brought to life in the audio version by a mind-blowing performance by Ron Silver. The Swede was the hero of narrator Nathan Zuckerman's youth, the "household Apollo of the Weequahic [New Jersey] Jews." The Swede's blond good looks and athletic prowess became "the repository of all their hopes" -- and allowed the neighborhood to forget the war. To Zuckerman, the Swede had been the embodiment of the hero of his favorite childhood book, "The Kid From Tomkinsville." The Kid was a star ball player, a "modest, serious, chaste, loyal, naive, undiscourageable, hard-working, soft-spoken, courageous" boy, who, in the final pages of the book, was struck down on the field and carried off inert through the mob on a stretcher. Zuckerman had secretly viewed this story as an augur of the Swede's own life. Zuckerman had wondered if it had occurred to the Swede "that if disaster could come and strike down the Kid from Tomkinsville, it could come and strike the great Swede down too?" The Swede's mythic power stays with Zuckerman throughout his life. Forty-five years later, out of the blue, the Swede contacts Zuckerman -- now a renowed writer -- and invites him to dinner, ostensibly to talk about the Swede's father. Zuckerman accepts the invitation, but is incredibly disappointed in how the Swede has turned out. Although he still had the face and physique of a God, the Swede seems to be almost unbearably bland -- every word from his mouth is good natured and unobjectionable. Zuckerman sadly concludes that the Swede has turned out to be "the embodiment of nothing," but soon finds out that his assessment of the Swede is wrong. A few months after the dinner, Zuckerman runs into the Swede's younger brother Jerry at their forty-five-year high school reunion. Jerry reveals that an unbelievable, unthinkable tragedy had befallen the Swede twenty-five years before, and the horror of that event had destroyed the Swede's life. For the rest of the book, Zuckerman explores "the brutality of the destruction of this indestructible man." Zuckerman imagines the Swede's internal life over the course of a half-century. The Swede's story unfolds in a spiralling structure that goes back and forth through time, as the Swede obsessively tries to make sense of the inexplicable. Through the Swede's ruminations, Roth explores incredibly weighty themes: a parent's love for a child, the nature of perfection, the randomness of life, the delusion of control and moderation, and the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to figure out why things are. Most of all, Roth seems to struggle with the notion that there cannot be depth without suffering, and that without that depth, life would be meaningless. You get the feeling that Roth wishes he could appreciate the ordinary guy -- the bland, honorable, decent people who live their lives with relative equilibrium. Roth seems to regret that it is only the Swede's tragedy that makes him interesting, and that it is only in imagining the Swede's excrutiating pain that Roth can identify with him. Overall, the book's tone is intense and dark, but there are moments of humor that are funnier than just about anything I've ever read. Roth's description of the Valentine's gift that the fifteen-year-old Jerry makes for his secret crush had me laughing for days. 
The first three-quarters of this novel are absolutely captivating and "unputdowanably" good. And yet just when I thought it was about to get even better, Roth shifts gears and peels away another layer of the onion to show us these people and their friends and family through the main character's eyes. While eventually the story picks up again, this radical shift took away some of the enjoyment for me. Nevertheless, Roth is his typically, excellent self here, providing great prose, excellent character development and a gripping plot. The Nathan Zuckerman character doesn't play as much of a role in this novel as he did in, say, The Human Stain. Here, it's frankly an unnecessary device, even though it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment. My only quibble is that I was far more interested in Merry, the main character's daughter, than in the range of emotions Swede Levov -- the main character -- experiences. I wanted to see Merry more, especially as she was doing, seeing, thinking, and ultimately developing into the radical protester she would become. Instead, it is all given to us second hand, from Swede's discoveries and we experience his emotional turmoil instead of hers. True to life in that way, I suppose, as few of us really experience the center of the storm. We mostly hear about others doing so. Still ... 
American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good. But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
I just finished reading American Pastoral, my first book by Philip Roth. Since it is my first Roth, I think I provide an unbiased perspective. I know he has written some other stuff, but my mind has not yet been corrupted by it. OK, so what is my opinion of American Pastoral? For starters, I think the style is a lot like that of Joseph Conrad in Lord Jim (the only Conrad I have read). There are pages upon pages of diversions from the main plot; lengthy descriptions of people sitting around at dinner tables; single events that are analyzed and re-analyzed from every possible angle, and then re-analyzed again. This type of literature is often fascinating but can quickly become tiresome, so I am not surprised that some of the Amazon reviewers were not able to finish the book. As far as readability is concerned, this book gets a B+. Delicious in places, starchy in others. Now, what about the main point that Roth is trying to make? He wants to tell us something fundamental about the All-American Man. He wants us to re-think our concept of the Successful American. He wants us to examine the American Dream closely and see what lies beneath its surface. He wants us to look behind the facade of beauty pageants and country clubs and face lifts and Little League and white teeth and football and big muscles and all that other good stuff we cherish about America. In this book, Roth tries to lift the veil and show us the real America. Is he successful? Sort of. For example, the fetid mess that propels All-American Swede toward insanity is masterfully portrayed. The mental breakdown of our All-American Hero is wonderfully choreographed. The Hero's slow descent into hell is captured page by page in exquisite detail. However, depsite all this terrific stuff, I came away with the odd notion that Roth himself may be slightly out of touch. This book is clearly written from the perspective of an older generation. The younger generation is seen as infantile, petulant, irksome, depraved, and so forth. Adolesence, to Roth, apparently has few redeeming features. Youth exists simply to torment the elderly, the Establishment. Roth, and his cast of bittersweet characters, are sadly on the wrong side of the hill. I don't want to say that Roth comes off looking like a grumpy old man. So I won't say it. I'll just think it. Lesson I learned from reading this book: if you are lucky enough to get a chance to live the American Dream, live it by all means! Enjoy! But, if you do decide you want to live the American Dream, go in with your eyes wide open. The American Dream is more complicated than it looks! Read the book if you have already lived your American Dream and you want to compare notes with somebody else who has been there, done that, too. Pass on this book if you are youthful, optimistic, and your Dream is still alive. You can always read this book afterward, once things settle comfortably down and you want to reflect on what it all meant 
I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times 
I am not a fan of using the same protagonist in many novels. I tend to think that it's a result either of laziness on the part of the author (the protagonist being so close to his own voice that to strike out with another character would be too difficult) or the desire to cash in on the success of previous novels with the same character. I put those issues aside to read this book anyway and I was very happy that I did. Thankfully, there was no need to be familiar with the other books. The details in this book of the politics of Zuckerman's youth, the glove factory, and the anguish at losing his daughter to the world make this a great novel. I have a terrible memory for the characters and events of stories, but this one remains with me. I've added several other of Roth's book to my future reading list 
This astonishingly insightful tragedy shows the unreliable outcome that can stem from almost any (?all) of our American contemporary civil virtues, demonstrating that outcomes can't be predicted from input. The structure of the book convincingly shows us the "The Swede" first as a fortunate simpleton, hiding the intense, multi-dimensional tragedy of his life and his spirit. Later we find that Seymour is overwhelmed by the failure of his own well-intended efforts to save his daughter, his community, his family and his profound decency. The reader suffers along with the character as he simply refuses to save himself from the mystery, pain and layered consequences of an explosive event that consumes all he loves. The portrayal ( betrayal) is told in entirely convincing prose, with flawless ethnic insight and painfully realistic anguish. Reading this was overwhelming 
I had my doubts about this book. I am a professional dog trainer, and a animal behaviorist. I would not recommened this book for your average reader. However it covers the basics of canine behavior very well and I would recommend it to anyone who trains dogs, or works with groups of dogs and wants a deeper understanding of their social interactions. Reads a bit on the scientific side, so if your reading for entertainment you will probably be bored. If your reading to learn and increase your knowledge, you will probably enjoy 
I doubt that some of the examples were true to life. Some dogs were at first presented as knowing as much as a 3 year old human child. These dogs were presented as responding to long sentences and did things that dogs just cannot do. Then the book analysed these impossible canine responses. And I do not accept the book's analysis. These fantastic canine responses could not have happened as the book asserts. However, the material presented seems sound enough in principal. I guess the author was taking artistic license to amplify the points of his thesis. Whatever, it doesn't matter. This book does support many of my own observations and has given me insight into dog behavior that I was not yet aware. I am 67, a lifetime dog owner who spent a year working full time for a Veterinarian when I was 17, and presently have a 5 year German Shepherd. If you are a typical dog owner you will gain much from this book 
I don't agree with all that he says, but it is all interesting. Lots of information to integrate with practical learning 
I have a "special needs" dog and I have been searching for a book that will give me practical ways to work with her. This book has given me a lot of helpful information without reiterating the obvious. Great find! 
While I can't pretend to have gotten inside the mind of Stanley Coren, I am willing to speculate that he wrote this book as a way of taking a very specific scientific controversy out of the realm of academia and bringing it to the people. The controversy: do dogs have a true language or do they not? Having recently rewatched Miracle on 34th Street, I recall Kris Kringle's attorney's comment on the controversy over belief in Santa Clause. "Some firmly believe in him, others just as strongly deny his existence." In keeping with the spirit of the season when we're a little more likely than usual to believe that animals speak, it's a great time to buy this book as a present for a serious dog lover on your list. It seems obvious to me that Coren takes the controversy seriously; taking it to the people is not a cop out. Rather his singular achievement is to bring a body of evidence, if you will, to pet owners who normally would not be part of this academic jury. While reading How To Speak Dog, again and again I'd find myself exclaiming "Wow, that's Oliver's call to be let in, or so that's what Emmie is saying to Hannah." After completing my first read, I kept the book on the end table having dog eared (sorry, couldn't resist) the section entitled "Doggish Phrase Book". This Doggish-English dictionary is a must-have for your next visit to the park where Doggish is the language of the land. Stanley, "May I call you Stanley?", has organized the phrasebook by sounds, and by ear, eye, facial, tail, and other body signals. Then for each phrase he provides the human meaning, corresponding emotions and conditions of the dog when the phrase is uttered. Basically, "This is what the dog is saying when you see and hear this behavior." Often, for weeks after I finished the book, whenever I'd hear a bark, a whine, a howl, or see a crooked tail I'd pop open the phrase book and compare Coren's interpretation to my own. I've often found myself recommending this book to friends, psychologists and other dog lovers. As a sociologist myself I've always been interested in cross cultural communication. Over time, little by little I came to realize I'd become even more interested in cross-species communication between people and dogs. Progress has been slow. I guess it's hard to study cultural differences when you don't understand the language. But I digress. So, back to the basic question. "Oh, yes", Stanley concludes, dogs have a language. There are four generally accepted key requirements for language and dogs show all four, one to a lesser extent than the other three: * Meaningfulness - canine sounds and signals are not random, but convey a specific meaning * Displacement -- the ability to target things not currently in sight "Go get the ball in the kitchen." * Display rules of combination -- some combinations are not meaningful when used together. Dogs don't lay down to get a tummy rub and seriously growl at the same time * Productivity - the ability to put words together in novel ways. Stanley acknowledges that productivity is weak (though it does exist) in Doggish. But the same is true in human toddlers and few would argue that toddlers have no language, just that they understand far more than they can express in words. So, while at this time of year, I'm especially willing to believe in Santa, I find that all year long I'm willing to believe dogs have a language. Thanks, Stanley. I won't be surprised if my peers in the jury decide to vote the same, "Yes, Virginia, dogs do have language. 
this book was not only full of information, it was fun to read also!! it gave alot of the background of todays canine which is important to know in order to understand what your dog is "saying". Wonderful book!! I recommend it to anyone who has a dog or wants a dog or just likes learning about dogs! 
As a lover of dogs for over 50 years, I own dozens of books about canine care and behavior, but Stanley Coren's 'How to Speak Dog' is definitely my favorite. I originally found this informative dog communication book in my local library after adopting a lovable but fearful mixed breed from my local humane society five years ago. Since then, I have bought at least six copies of this same book online, just to have on hand to give to friends and family who decide to bring a dog into their life or who don't understand the behavior of a dog already living with them. I especially like the book's detailed descriptions of a dog's specific body language (ears, eyes, mouth, tail) and what each means--as well as its guide to the messages a dog is sending when he barks or whines in a particular way. Not unlike a driver's training manual which must be read by those who wish to become licensed drivers, 'How to Speak Dog" should be required reading for every person who decides to share his or her life with a dog. 
Very good book. Very informative. Easy to read and easy to learn from. I would recommend this for anyone working with dogs in any capacity and for those who just want to have better comunication with their dog 
Do dogs understand language? Do they have their own syntax and grammar? Stanley Coren thinks so. Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies... The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant. Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs. When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit. This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look! They understand every word you say!" Not really. I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit." Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily. In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all. So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.  Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him. Why? Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words. Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language. But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process. Coren would still disagree. He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work. I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level. And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity. Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state. In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be. It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple. Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible. But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth. Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc. As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists. I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question. And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose. Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him? Of course not. But I know he understands the emotion. It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language. If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
Very well written. It connected a lot of dots for both my wife myself, bringing better understanding about us as well as our dog friends. We've always believed that when you train your dog you also are training yourself. We have loved all of our 'friends' that have shared their lives with us are just now beginning a new bond with our third Dalmatian puppy. Anyone that has had any experience around this breed knows the special Aura they wear this book is a 'must read' for You. Sincerely John Steen Sr 
I'm new at reading about energy healing modalities, so I have little to compare it to. I found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about Healing Touch and how to be a practitioner. It has some wonderful stories, some that even made me cry. I still have a long way to go to make this work for me, but it's the beginning of a new awareness in my life 
This devotional is well rounded, and very complete for day to day study. You can take a half hour or as long as you desire and it is truly food for your soul. I look forward to my devotional time and am so excited by the growth this book encourages 
I suggest this prayer guide to anyone who is trying to mature in their Christian faith. It is simple to use and straight forward in design. Focused weekly topics that are supported by scripture in each daily reading. Being in the Word daily is the best way to grow close to Jesus Christ, the Son, our God. Would make a great gift too for someone you love 
This guide to prayer is just one more in the continuing line of beneficial products offered by Upper Room Publishing. Many people look for ways to deepen their time spent in spiritual growth and development. Too often we focus so heavily on ourselves that we forget the contributions of the past. The guide to prayer series offers insights that have been gleened from the spiritual practices of the church throughout the centuries. The format is simple and concise taking the reader on a journey of daily worship including invocational prayer, spiritual readings, scripture, meditation, prayers, hymns, journaling, and benediction. The readings for reflection pull in the insight of spiritual leaders both past and present and take on both a theological and inspirational tone. This particular version is adapted for use by pastor's and laymen alike. Upper Room is to be commended for this work. It is a must have for all persons who long to deepen the spiritually formative moments of their day 
Job 5:8 "But as for me, I would seek God,And I would place my cause before God." Psalm 9:10 "And those who know Your name will put their trust in You,For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You." Psalm 14:2 "The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of menTo see if there are any who understand,Who seek after God." Psalm 22:26b "Those who seek Him will praise the LORD Let your heart live forever!" Psalm 70:4 "Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;And let those who love Your salvation say continually,"Let God be magnified." If you seek an ardent devotional life, if you want to have a life of prayer, if you are looking for a guide on how to dwelve in the Word and reap the benefits of the Bille's wisdom, than look no more. Here is what I wrote my relatives and friends as a result of one morning's Bible reading of 2 Tim. 1:1-14 (suggested reading for that day). "I'm not here to push this book, but I want to say that my spiritual walk with God, on a day to day basis, starting the day and ending the day, has been very enriched as a result of reading the Scripture passages, meditating on the excerpts from spiritual writings and poems, and praying, with the help of this devotional book." The structure of the book is fairly simple. Week by week (according to the Christian calendar). Each week's daily devotions and texts are broken up in the following 8 categories: I. Invocation (written), II. One of the Psalms (as a prayerful reading material) III. Reading for Reflection (various numbers of little excerpts from spiritual writing from the whole rich treasure chest of Christian history and from all various denominational and traditional Christian faiths), IV. Daily Scripture Readings (Mon.-Sunday.; some of them are long like a whole chapter; others very short) V. Reflection: Silent and Written VI. Prayers: For the Church, for Others, and Myself (no prayers provided but one is asked to pray for these three areas) VII. Hymn (written) VIII. Benediction (written). You will not be sorry you invested the money in this book. The challenge is making the time to devote your life, heart, mind, soul to God and reap the benefits of your closeness to the divine. Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox - friendly. The authors come from the Methodist tradition but are very ecumenically minded 
we bought this as a gift but have been using it for years as a devotional book. this is great to use for people from various denominations! i am a die hard presbyterian who married a Catholic and have now converted! this book's methodist roots keeps the big picture of God's Truth and Jesus, the Light, in focus! it has meat, and one can apply it to one's daily walk 
This book fed me richly for a period of two years, and I am not easy to please 
Provides a wonderful outline and schedule for getting into or maintaining the habit of daily prayer and devotions. The themes that permeate this book are Worship, Forgiveness, and Servanthood. This is a great tool to grow with 
I've used this book for about two years as a simple, predictable structure for prayer and bible reading. Each week, new area or faith is explored, following the lectionary used in most churches today. A simple invocation (or opening) prayer is presented, followed by a Psalm reading. Next is a reading on the subject, which is borrowed from other resources (these readings cross all boundaries in terms of geography and date written), followed by a Scripture reading. Next is a time of reflection, where one is encouraged to journal and reflect upon the topic in light of the information presented from man and the Word. Next is prayer time, a hymn, and a closing prayer. A weekly "recipe" with some ingredients provided, the book has a life span of 4 years, with the current edition 2001-2004 
December 1986 my family presented me with this book. I enjoy readings of William Barclay, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Carlo Carretto, Richard Foster, Carl Jung, C. S. Lewis, Henri J. Nouwen, Mother Teresa, Elton Trueblood, John Wesley, to name a few. But to have writings by these great authors compiled in one book is unimaginable. On top of that there are the lyrics of some of the most well known and loved hymns included in this book. There are monthly retreat models that can be done individually or with a group. The story "A Doll of Salt" by Anthony Bloom is a wonderful simile of our developing relationship with God. I have highlighted, written in the margins, and dogeared so many pages that I had to get a second copy because the first one is falling apart (and it was the leather bound copy). The readings are so inspiring and uplifting as well as thought provoking for the layperson as well as the ordained minister. If you are going to get this book I encourage you to get the leather bound for you will discover you will use it on a daily basis along with your Bible 
This book was easy to read and divided into segments that allowed for user-friendly access. I have referred to it numerous times since I received it and would recommend it to those homeschool parents facing the teen years. The best part of the book was the resources at the end of each section. It helped me see what parts in our curriculum needed improvement and which parts were right on target 
This is the second book I have read from Cafi Cohen. I find her writing straightforward, exciting, and relaxing at the same time. This book contains lots of good resource information which can appeal to all sorts of homeschoolers. I am pleased that Cafi Cohen writes with regard to all homeschoolers, not just religious ones. Unlike some other authors, Mrs. Cohen does not pepper her writing with her own religious beliefs 
I have been homeschooling for 11 years now and I must say this has been one of the most useful publications I have come across. I have already struggled through two teens with little help and not knowing where to turn for resources. There is a great deal of information for the younger years, but very little for teens. This book not only give you insightful information to make your teens education well rounded and interesting, but it also provides a wealth resources to turn for further information. No homeschool should be without it 
I got my copy of Homeschooling, The Teen Years and read it through immediately. It was such an encouragement. Although we have been homeschooling for more than five years, sometimes I get cold feet and fear that we are not doing enough. Cafi's book points out the many ways we educate our kids every day and gives suggestions for new things to try. I highly recommend this book to people who are considering homeschooling their teens, and especially to those who are already doing it 
This is a great book for anyone homeschooling teenagers. In a wonderful, easy-to-read format, it discusses concerns of every family member -- mom and dad and teens and younger children. The author answers questions that new homeschoolers have, such as "How do we get legal?" and "Where do we find curriculum?" and "What about a diploma?" In addition the book contains a wealth of information for experienced home educators. Drawing not only on the author's years homeschooling her own children, but also on the experience of dozens of homeschooling families worldwide, this title contains an incredible number of fun, creative, practical, and money-saving suggestions for all subjects -- writing, foreign languages, advanced math, history, science, and so on. Based on a survey results compiled by the author, you will find lists throughout of homeschoolers' favorites -- from software to historical videos to authors teens love. One chapter discusses part-time homeschooling and afterschooling, that is, using homeschooling resources and approaches with schooled children. This is perfect for those families who want to use tried-and-true homeschooling resources to improve their child's math abilities or to enrich their teen's school history curriculum. Afterschooling offers ways to try homeschooling without jumping in full-time. Above all, the book emphasizes that there is no one right way to succeed. Instead it details many paths to success -- traditional approaches, unit studies, interest-initiated learning, and eclectic approaches -- and invites you to select those options that best fit your family 
"Catch Me If You Can" follows the life of Frank W. Abignale - one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was. This book is the autobiographical account of Abignale's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father's Mobil credit card. There are so many times in this book that I had to step back and think about the air of confidence that Abignale displayed, yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him. Some of the stories are absolutely outrageous. I loved them all! This book also talks about his time in prison across seas in Europe and how terrible he was treated in the French prisons. If you liked the movie then you should definately read this book. It further explores his adventures and exploits in greater detail and includes many capers that were not in the movie. A must read 
This book was very well written and so much fun to read. Frank Abagnale tells his story with the same flare and finesse that he pulled off the cons of his criminal career. Entertaining from start to finish 
We all know of Frank Abagnale's personality; arrogant, yet kind with class. Among all the different characters that he chooses to play, whether he's a pilot, doctor, lawyer, or a college professor, i believe that Frank is somewhat confused of who he is. Frank "ran away" from home at 16; the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school. At 16, most people don't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future. One thing was for sure; Frank wanted money and women. I believe Frank's unique personality came from the way he was brought up. Having endured his parent's divorce at a young age was a life changing experience for him. It all started with his father; Frank Abagnale. During the process of his(Jr.'s) parent's divorce, his father still loved is mother. So Frank(Sr.) would try to get his son to say things like "Talk to her son...tell her I love her. Tell her we'd be happier if we all lived together. Tell her you'd be happier if she came home, that all you kids would be happier." His(Jr's) father led him to the first step of manipulation. Frank stayed with his father after the finalizing of the divorce. Since his father was quite a rich man, he had a whole variety of rich friends and Frank(Jr.) would come in contact with his friends quite often. This is where Frank learned the "attitude of the rich", with confidence. Finally when Frank did his first con with his father's money, Frank(Sr.) forgave him. "Look, son, if you'll tell us how you did this, and why, we'll forget it. There'll be no punishments and I'll pay the bills." Frank probably felt that he could get away with anything at this point and without any punishment, he didn't believe this to be a huge mistake. With confidence, manipulation, some class and little fear of breaking the law, we come to Frank Abagnale Jr. 
Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
If you, like me, have seen the film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book, you are reading the right review! If you were in front of me, I would look at you with a grin (as if to show that I knew something you didn't) and encourage you to do so. Frank Abagnale is less likable in the book, which is to be expected, but is still far from what we would consider a true villain. It caught me by surprise about halfway through how I was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values. I suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy. Overall, a fun read that may possibly help you appreciate the film even more 
I read this book after watching the movie (staring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio). Before I started I knew I liked the story, but I didn't realize how much. I loved reading Abagnale's account of his life of crime. I enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot, a doctor, a professor, and a lawyer. I also liked the novel's open frankness about the author's misdeeds. However, I thought the book was not especially well written. Abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion. I also felt somewhat deprived with the novel's ending. Frank Abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms, but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story. I would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right. All in all, I would recommend this book as an easy weekend read 
Many people became aware of Frank Abagnale Jr's story until the movie starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicapprio was released (even though an earlier movie based on this story was released). While not as flowing as the movie, the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life, containing many of Abagnale's earlier mistakes lessons we don't get to see in the movie. On the other hand, many parts of it do seem to be missing - such as why Air France would take such an interest in catching Frank, even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly American based? This is an interesting read as a background to the movie, and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie's major storylines 
Not a reader of fiction, fantasy, sci-fi... therefore picked up a copy of "Catch Me If You Can" from a bookstore yesterday... Seen the film more than 10times.. loved the film, loved the characters, loved the plot... LOVED the book even more... can't put it down... the story just flows perfectly... Makes you wonder what Franky can do at the age of 16,17 etc. A real inspiration... the book's plot is BY-FAR better than the movie... Would have been great to read it before watching the film.. still good to read it after watching the film.. Overall, it's a great book finished it in a da 
Ideal for anyone with an interest in evading capture 
First, I want to say that this is the paperback version of The Cooks Illustrated Complete Book of Poultry (different title, different cover design.) This is a great book especially for those who eat a lot of chicken and are looking for a variety of ways to prepare it, like me. There are recipes for dishes from many different traditions, which I like, and all are tasty. If you look at the table of contents, you'll see that they are arranged by cooking method, which is handy. And the book has all the explanations and clear directions typical of Cooks Illustrated books. My absolutely only complaint is that I appreciate it when an entire recipe is printed across two open pages, so I can put it in my cookbook stand and leave it there, and that is not the case here: I have to turn the page. But that's minor. Highly recommended 
This is the sort of cookbook that grows with you. If you're a novice cook, or you cook only because you have to put something on the table every night, you will find this book enlarges the number of fool-proof chicken dishes you can put on the table without much fuss. Each chapter suggests several variations, so you can adapt to what you have on hand or what's fresh at the store. There are also handy chapters on soup, leftovers and turkey breasts. If you're a more seasoned or adventurous cook-or you'd like to become one!-you will appreciate the scope of the book, which provides basic recipes in 37 chapters, including what to do with duck, goose, quail, squab, and pheasant. With a proven "method" at hand, you can experiment with seasonings vegetables and feel confident that your new creation will at least be edible. Or if you prefer to stick to the book, there are more complex dishes here, such as Sauted Butterflied Chicken with Tomato, Olive and Caper Pan Sauce and Grilled Squab with Red Chile-Pumpkin Seed Sauce. If you like America's Test Kitchen or Cook's Illustrated, this book is a guaranteed winner. Even if that's not you style, you might find the abundance of recipes makes this a winner anyways. Best of all, it's affordable 
The books are indeed a masterpiece collection of sorts. Very racy and laced with black humor and the sort of a plot which you can put into a perspective, for instance, the reference to mob psychology harks about to blacks burned/lynched in 1930's America, to many such instances in third world countries like India and Pakistan where many a woman, child and man have been victimc of such outbursts born out of sheer greed or religious intolerance. For instance there is a Muslim Religious leader in Australia saying that women invite rape by exposing their body parts. WOW! Count Olaf, indeed! The writer is not shedding tears for the children here or is presenting a bleak picture for us to salivate on but is really afraid for us and trying to make us careful in our decisions and largely he is trying, most explicitly, to say that a family should bond well together - for all other relationships are transitory. A very practical one! Should I say! 
Plot: interesting. Suspence: present. Entertainment: keep. Hidden messages: a few. Book ranking for series: 5th Mysteries: Hospital related only 
Dear Reader, Unlike previous books in the series, THE HOSTILE HOSPITAL takes place immediately after THE VILE VILLAGE. The three Baudelaire children are all alone walking across a large empty space when the reach The Last Chance General Store. The children had just escaped from V.F.D. the evening before and were now wanted by the police for the murder of Jacques Snicket. Mixed-up and misrepresentations of the deeds were going to appear in the morning edition of THE DAILY PUNCTILIO. Hungry and without another chance in the world, the children enter The Last Chance. It's too terrible to describe what horrors are inflicted upon them there. Somehow the escape and make their way to the Heimlich Hospital where they join with a group of singing people known as the V.F.D., Volunteers Fighting Disease. It's not the V.F.D. that their parents were members of, but this V.F.D. inadvertently assist the Baudelaire's in finding new information about their parents. Oh, my. But that was before Violet was captured by Count Olaf, before she was supposed to have her head removed, and before a major fire. Oh, those poor children! I can't write about them anymore at the moment. Read about them yourself. I think I'll go buy a heart-shaped balloon to make me feel better because my stomach feels queasy. Sincerely, Uncle T 
The first seven books of A Series of Unfortunate Events followed the same formula. The Baudelaire Orphans are with the banker Mr. Poe until he can find a new relative willing to care for the siblings. Things go badly and the evil Count Olaf shows up with another nefarious plan to kidnap the children and somehow steal their inheritance. In the end they get away and Olaf is on the run from the authorities. The ending of The Vile Village changes this. The Baudelaires are on the run, suspected of the murder of Count Olaf despite the fact that he isn't dead and that there is no way they could have committed the non-existent crime. The Hostile Hospital opens with the orphans trying to find a place where they can learn about VFD, the Quagmire triplets, and some clue that will help keep them safe and stop Count Olaf from coming after them ever again. This time there is no Mr. Poe and no new distant relative to live with. Count Olaf is in much less of this book than we have come to expect, though he and his cronies play major roles in instigating the action. Author Lemony Snicket (an assumed name as the author is as much a character in the story as the Baudelaires are) does an excellent job in presenting the story of the Baudelaires experiences at a hospital trying to research in the records room what the truth behind the events of the past several novels and once more running afoul of the minions of Count Olaf and being placed into mortal danger once again. Snicket sets up the next volume very well and tells the story in such a way that the novel flows into the next book while telling an independent story at the same time. The breaking of the formula of the series is a refreshing change and spices up the action quite a bit. The Hostile Hospital is one of the best of the first eight volumes in this series. -Joe Sherr 
This book is a concise well written guide to the core issues of buying, owning and selling multifamily buildings. It was extremely valuable in evaluating our first purchase of a multi-family structure 
As a real estate investor and author myself, I read a lot of real estate books. Many, if not most, are written by folks who do not invest in real estate themselves; they only write about it. Berges is not one of them. He knows his stuff and it's clear that he practices what he preaches. I have read three of his books and, I must say, he's one of my favorite real estate authors. You can trust what he says. Experienced investors may want a bit more detail from Steve, but what he does say is accurate and safe. This is a good book on buying apartments. In fact, in my own book, "Investing in Duplexes, Triplexes Quads," I list the best books I've read on different areas of real estate. This book is the ONLY book I recommend on investing in commercial multifamily (ie, apartments of 5 units and up) properties. Having given those accolades, here are a few of my constructive criticisms: 1. On pages 37 and 38, Steve gives nice charts illustrating the long-term financial benefits of investing in multifamily properties. On page 39, however, there is an error in referring to the big numbers shown. The reference is made to Investor A's "equity" of $2.1 million and Investor B's (the multifamily property investor) equity of $92 million. I just don't think Steve caught this, but those numbers don't refer to the investor's equity, but to the fair market value of his collective assets (his properties). The investor's equity might be in the range of 20% of that. I do like the charts, however, and I used a similar analysis in my recent book. One other note on the charts - they presume selling and buying exactly at the end of one year - a difficult task as Steve would surely admit. On average, I think 18 months to two years is a better time frame for flipping apartments. 2. Refinancing - Steve didn't give a chart showing the long-range effect of the "buy, hold and refy" strategy (using proceeds to buy again, but retaining the first property). In addition, Steve only mentioned the general banking guideline that you can only pull out cash up to 80% of the new appraised value (i.e., the bank has an LTV of 80%). However, you can get around this. I've done it. It requires a second lender giving a second mortgage, with a CLTV (combined loan to value) of up to 90%. As such, you can pull out much more cash. 3. GRM - gross rent multiplier. In his financial analysis section, Steve doesn't give much detail or provide real life examples on this crucial analysis factor. Granted, the cap rate is the analysis primarily used for commercial real estate, while the GRM is the one used for residential multifamily (2-4 units) real estate. Since many owners and selling brokers will "fudge" on expenses, a cap rate can be very hard to verify. The GRM, however, is fairly simple - just look at the lease agreements. 4. Lack of coverage on residential multifamily apartments. In fact, this is why I wrote my book on this topic. If Steve had covered it here, I would not have written mine. I like Steve's writing style and he knows his stuff. But for investing in small multifamily properties (certainly on residential, but probably up to about 10 units), we really have to cover valuation and selection of properties using the GRM. That and I felt like the "buy, hold, and refy" strategy needed much more coverage. But for investing in commercial multifamily properties, I recommend this book as the only good one on the market. Larry Loftis Author: Investing in Duplexes, Triplexes and Quads: The Fastest and Safest Way to Real Estate Wealth 
Excellent and reasonably comprehensive introduction to the business of investing in multifamily properties 
This is the second Steve Berges book that I've read. I read his book, "The Complete Guide to Real Estate Investing". He focused on obtaining value once you make the purchase. That is very sound advice. With so many people investing in property hoping to make a profit after they fix it, Steve urges you to pursue profitability prior to making any modifications. Do not pursue property that requires capital investment or upgrades prior to a positive cash flow. That's very basic but sage advice 
This was the first book I have purchased on the subject of real estate investing in multi-family properties. I have been and interested in the subject for some time however. I found the formulas and rules the book includes to be invaluable, and used them to create Excel spreadsheets to quickly analyze the hundreds of multi-family listings available. I found the book to be easy to read and understand. 
This book is very informative if you are a beginner to the multi family world. For anyone that has already dealt with multi family, then you do not need this book. However, Berges other book, real estate finance is a good review for the seasoned apartment owner. In that book he goes over some key performance and efficiency ratios that everyone should be aware of when dealing with multi family properties. The book covers the general ideas behind multi family properties but of course it will differ by region slightly. The cap rates that he speaks of are not available in say california but might be available in indiana. Overall a good book for beginners to intermediate but definitely not seasoned investors 
Out of all of the real estate books I've read over the years, this is by far one of the better ones. The author stays focused on the topic of buying and selling apartments and does it in a way that is easy to understand. Let me emphasize that when I say the book is easy to understand, that is not meant to imply that only the basics are covered. Not only does Berges do a great job of explaining the mechanics of the process, but he also mixes in a lot of personal examples which help the reader to connect the dots between pie-in-the-sky theory and real world applications. Steve Berges concludes the book with an inspiring and motivational chapter he refers to as the 5 Keys to Success, which he points out are not limited to just real estate, but can be applied to any business or profession, as well as to one's personal life. I thought this section was very well written and gave me cause to reflect on my own course in life. I've read several of the author's other books as well, all of which were good, but I particularly enjoyed The Complete Guide to Real Estate Finance for Investment Properties. Wow...what a great read! It's about time somebody wrote a book that really deals with the financial aspects of real estate (see my review) 
The author, Berges, provides unique insight into investing in apartment buildings. There isn't much written about this topic, and what is, seems to be very generic. This book, however, provided lots of good examples with specific advice on what to do and what not to do. In addition, Berges sprinkles various tidbits of information throughout the book that while not directly related to real estate, are nevertheless quite relevant to being successful in it. I just finished another book of his, The Complete Guide to Investing in Rental Properties, which I also found to be very enjoyable 
I found this book to be an excellent "primer" for the novice investor who wants to learn about the basics of investing in mutual funds. Bogle describes the various types of mutual funds in simple plain language 
I first became interested in this title because of the positive review by Warren Buffett. There's so much hype in the investing field that you'll save hundreds of hours of wasted time and thousands of dollars in lost money by consulting a genius to separate the wheat from the chaff. It's not always an exciting, easy read but it's essential knowledge if you're investing or planning to invest in funds. Its simple concepts that take some mental work to understand. Those that make big money in individual stock investing normally invest a tremendous amount of time understanding their field AND the particular companies they're risking their money on. If you don't have the time or inclination to do this, mutual funds are one safe way to go. For my money, your number one investment is in becoming valuable in whatever field you have a passion for. After enough money starts flowing and you want a relatively safe approach to investing and compounding excess funds (above what you need for a comfortable--not extravagant--lifestyle), Bogle explains the simple concepts for compounding your money over time. Don't take my word for it. Read the back page of the book for the brilliant investing minds that have given Bogle's ideas their stamp of approval. 
My first and final book on mutual funds. I've read several others, but keep returning to this one. The end of chapter summaries are invaluable. It is a tougher read than most and Mutual Funds for Dummies ins easier and in the same vein 
I read this book when it first came out ten years ago at the beginning of the bull market. At the time the book had mixed reviews. One of Bogle's warning, and probably the best advice, is to watch out for funds that charge high fees and to study all the fees charged in all funds. I remember one reviewer feeling that Bogle was overreacting to the fees that funds charged and that fund managers are really on our side. Fast-forward to today, we have the mutual fund scandal and we learn that mutual fund managers aren't really working on our best interests. Though reading this book can't help you spot all the bad apples ( the Janus family has alot of no-load funds and it was implicated in the scandal) it can help you be aware and thus be more weary. In a nutshell, this book is comprehensive,honest and prescient. John Bogle is the conscience of the mutual fund industry 
Bogle provides an excellent guide to the world of mutual funds. He begins with an introduction to three primary classes of investments namely stocks, bonds and cash reserves and goes on to provide an excellent insight into analysing and selecting a mutual fund. A must read for anyone who has invested or is planning to invest in mutual funds 
Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own. I own this book...this play because I read it while in a Humanities course in college. I went to college rather "late" in life...whatever that means...and yet I derived more from the experience than I probably would have had I gone right after High School. I am one of those people who believe that it's not college that makes a "well-rounded" indivividual, but life experience. If colleges and universities handed out degrees based on Life Experience, I'd probably have a doctorate three times over... We were given the assignment of reading this play and seeing the live production that the college I was attending just so happened to be putting on. With my primary focus being on philosphy, I embraced the Existentialism Unit that we were now focused upon. My best friend, who was/is an "atheist" was less receptive of these Existentialist ideas he considered strange and elusive. You think he, being an atheist, would have been more open to them than I who had already been bitten by the Metaphysics/Spirituality plague. Truth be told I think the only reason he says he's an atheist is because he's a cheapskate and doesn't want to shell out extra money for Christmas gifts. So we go see this play and people were getting pretty agitated. In this play everything goes round and round but never arrives at any final conclusions and I noticed how we, as a society, love our answers. We are not soothed by questions and proposistions and "what if?" scenarios. We feel the need to latch onto something because something is better than nothing. Isn't it? The Existentialists believe that the universe is random, chaotic, and ultimately meaningless and so in a sense they "give" meaning to meaninglessness. Just like an atheist believes in non-belief. You see, the human species cannot not give meaning to his/her life...we cannot not believe...we can "pretend" that life is without meaning and that we don't believe but everything that falls onto the screen of our perception, will take on the shape of our perceptions. I loved this play. I loved the merry-go-round type dialouge. Isn't this what we all do? We get a belief so engrained in our heads and we think that it is the only way to believe and so we spend a lot of time trying to convince someone who may not be as receptive to our point of view as to why it's valid. What I have learned over the years is that the only reason why a belief is valid is because we are the ones who validate it. It doesn't make us "more right" than the person who doesn't believe it, it just makes us believers of the belief. And contrary to popular opinion, the more people you have who also believe the same way you believe does not prove that it's any more valid than if only one person believed it. This play did not dissolve me into a puddle of desperation and futileness, in fact it added more meaning to my life which would probably make Samuel Beckett gag. It made me fall in love even more with this crazy life that only I can live. Nobody lives by proxy. Each of us are liberated and imprisoned by our beliefs. The best we can ever hope to be is determined by what we are willing to believe at any given time. This is why it's a good practice to sit down and journal about your beliefs from time to time and question why you still believe what you believe. You may have outgrown certain beliefs, certain ideas, certain ways of being in the world but don't be like the two "bums" in the play, don't keep postponing what it is that you eventually desire to see; see it now, live it now, be it now. If you are going to be an atheist, be the best atheist you can be. If you are going to be a Christian, be the best Christian you can be. If you are going to be an Anarchist, be the best Anarchist you can be. Just don't think that everyone is going to believe exactly as you believe and don't make others wrong simply because they may have another point of view. In the end, none of us truly know what's on the other side. Yes, we've had people with Near Death Experiences, but nobody has ever come back after being completely dead with a report, we just have reports from people who have been "mostly dead". Take life with a grain of salt and enjoy the ride. Peace Blessings. 
Waiting for Godot was dubbed a "tragicomedy" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play. The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work. However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you. Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be. Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own. What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality. Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous. Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale. Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold. A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor 
Samuel Beckett's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them. Is Godot God? Are Didi and Gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive, or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering? Waiting for Godot, in proper Modernist fashion, strips away all the layers of narrative and form and leaves nothing but the naked husk of a play, which Beckett no doubt felt revealed the human condition at its most basic. But the play's power doesn't really come from that. Rather, what makes Waiting for Godot so compelling is its wide applicability: it's a story about random oppression, brutality, and dreams deferred by harsh realities. It has been performed as an allegory of apartheid South African, the Jim Crow South, the horror of the war in Bosnia and about every other possible situation imaginable. Why? Because as Benjamin Kunkel pointed out in a piece in The New Yorker not so long ago, "[N]ot everyone has a God, but who doesn't have a Godot?" Beyond the metaphysical implications of the play, though, it's popularity stems from its near-perfection: for all the philosophical meaning people see in it, the action progresses with virtually no direct reference to it, and every line which seems to suggests some sort of grand significance has a very concrete meaning in the action. Take the infamous opening: Estragon, the first of the tramps, struggles to pull off his boot to relieve his swollen foot. Unable to get it off, he gives up and announces "Nothing to be done." Vladimir, wincingly wandering onto the stage and grasping at his crotch (precious few readers and actors for that matter seem to grasp that one of the play's running jokes is Vladimir's venereal disease, which causes him immense pain when urinating), thinks Estragon is commenting on his own ailment, and announces, "I'm beginning to come round to that conclusion myself. All my life I've put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything! And I resumed the struggle." On the one hand, the lines relate concretely to the action of the play; on the other, they have become representative of modern man's ambivalence towards a cruel and uncaring world, and such clever cynicism has linked Beckett to the French Existentialists in whose circles he moved after the Second World War. But seen merely as declamatory statements of world-weary cynicism, the lines lose all their power; Beckett's achievement comes from his ability to link such nihilistic sentiments to extremely comic moments, and it is the humor that carries the reader or the theatergoer through what would otherwise be an unbearably cynical play. Steve Martin, who played Vladimir in a famous 1982 production at the Lincoln Center in New York, put it best when he said that he sought to serve the humor of the play, because the meaning could carry itself but the humor could not. That's a lesson which, sadly, precious few theater directors seem to grasp, but which the careful reader discovers in Beckett. Definitely a must-read, but read it before seeing it, because few productions do it justice 
Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct. In short, this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language, to strip life down to a mere game of waiting. That is, in essence, what this is all about. We have two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up. They don't know why. They don't know exactly when he will be there. Still they wait, eternally, by the tree, by wherever they think he said he would show. This isn't an absurdist play, although it has been labeled as such. Absurdism, though, seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece. We oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex, that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story, but with Waiting for Godot, we have a simple theme: waiting. The two characters symbolize nothing. They are, quite simply, not waiting to be analyzed. They become, in effect, victims of Samuel Beckett's own game: they are his quotation, and he only says what needed to be said at the time, and so he wrote it, whether people would catch on or not, whether they would label it absurdism or not. If you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud, very slowly, word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion, you would probably capture the idea. If it's any indication, he wrote everything in French first--his second language--and then translated it in to English, just so it can be simple. I don't assume, of course, that this work should be cherished simply because it's an exercise in simplicity. But I submit that it should be cherished because it's a genuine, themeless--somehow--masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant, unknown thing that may or may not ever come. It is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous, but somehow, it manages to charm. It is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again, and it has no lyrics, and no meaning--as far as you know--but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity 
I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence. This work, however, is pure tripe. Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas. The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play. In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense. Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of "high art." The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms. Many critics have tried to convince us that WAITING FOR GODOT is very funny and entertaining. I remain skeptical. There are a few moments of wry humor, but not enough to make up for the emptiness of "waiting." There is literally "Nothing to be done" in this play. "Waiting" is a non-action. What's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant; there's something like an "alienation effect," or a "defamiliarization," as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful. Why is there "Nothing to be done"? Is it simply because it's all been done before? Or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning? In many ways, WAITING FOR GODOT is a reaction to the Holocaust and Hiroshima. The characters who have "something to do" in this play are Pozzo and Lucky, who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world. 
Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story. Most drama should be seen on stage, so that the performers can give their characters shape, bring in an audience, and produce a night of dramatic arts. That is not how this story seems to go; not at all, indeed. Beckett's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor. Here are two men, both obviously at the end of their ropes, but each keeps this asinine hope that "GODot" will show up. But, he never does. Extra characters, like Pozzo and Lucky, simply add to the intended confusion. As several previous reviewers have taken note--there is not action. While this idea is spurred by "The Threepenny Opera," Beckett takes postmodernism another step further. The characters' are so disillusioned the question becomes, Godot isn't coming, so did he ever care? Could Godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state. A fantastic read, and one of the best dramas ever written. This fairly short play should be read by EVERYONE. 
Many readers of 'Waiting for Godot' obsess about the identity of Godot and whether he represents God or any other almighty being. It is unlikely that Beckett was referring to God as the man for whom the characters are waiting, as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in Beckett's theatre. Although Beckett was not referring directly to God the name is not without importance. Godot is seen as a messianic being by the characters who will bring salvation for those who believed he would come. The wait for God is not represented by the play, but is used as a template. 'Waiting for Godot' is essentially a sustained metaphor for how most if not all human beings spend their whole life waiting for something that isn't coming. Beckett was not able to identify Godot because of the subjective nature of such a being. As critics have written, this play is a written ink-blot test and a failure to see any coherent meaning says more about the reader than the play. This is yet another example of Beckett's chilling insight into human nature, and his readiness to state what others are unwilling to accept 
Waiting for Godot, a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes, attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with--it is a call to action. This play is packed with nonsensical dialogue. The plot does not exsist. Yet, once we realized that Waiting for Godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense--at least in subtle ways. Much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality, but, that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century. It's enigmatic, a puzzle of words, poetry, and philosophy. I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. The play is short and does not take too much commitment. Take a quiet evening and give it a shot. What are you waiting for 
This book is just what it advertises - it is good down-to-earth and practical advice for those just starting out on their teaching careers. I've been teaching for several years but I found a good number of ideas in here to help orient our new faculty. I have just pulled every book in the library I could find on preparing faculty to instruct and this one was the best of the entire pile. I think it should be read by everyone just starting their teaching career. 
Considering the size of the book I was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given. They are mostly one word meanings, if there is a meaning at all. Mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for. It wasn't helpful for me. I found "The Babyname Wizard" book A LOT more informative and helpful 
I received this book as a gift and at first I thought 100,000 names would be too many to look through, but the lists really helped me narrow things down. Plus, my husband and I had a lot of fun flipping to random pages and seeing what we'd find! 
If nothing else, this book is great fun -- all the names from different cultures and countries are fascinating (though I'm not sure I'd want to name a daughter "Osiris"), especially since every name has a short description of its origin and meaning next to it. Lansky has clearly done his research -- there are lists of the most popular names from 1900 to 2004, and the big trends in baby-naming in the past few years so you can decide whether you want to go with or against the trends. Lansky has a few quick, easy articles about picking a name you and your baby will love -- it seems like so many people today forget to pick a name that will actually suit their child; a name that the child will want for the rest of their life -- and the impressions names make on people, as well as the legal aspect of naming (did you know that in the United States it is against the law to use numbers in names?). It's a huge book, a great resource. I don't plan to have kids of my own for a few years yet, and I don't think I'll use a baby name book of any kind when I do, but I have a few friends who've purchased this book and really loved it -- and I enjoy reading it, too 
I suspect the previous review from "Mom Of One" must be unnaturally biased or somehow associated with a competitor's title because it appears that she only exists sporadically enough to tout her chosen title, and then belittle its competitors. Nothing else currently seems to exist for this entity. Worst of all, "she" disclaims this book as being a copy of a title published in 2005 (first edition 2003), when a quick look-up shows that this publisher: Meadowbrook / Lansky, has been making baby name books since the late 70s/early 80s and is clearly one of the leaders in the field. This book is great as a resource, names neatly alphabetized with their origin and meaning, in an astounding range of ethnicities and languages. 100,000 names! I think that's more names than any other title on the market of this subject, and I love that it has French, Greek, Japanese, Hawaiian (!!!), African, Latvian, Spanish, Chinese - you name it! So you're not limited in any way, even names and their offshoots (i.e. names evolved from other names) are included. A pretty great resource for would-be parents and writers alike. I'm still a year or two off from family planning with the significant other, but I've browsed through this for the future ...and of course everyone looks up their own name. I've used this title as part of a gift basket to two of my planning expectant friends, and they've both loved it and used it extensively. One of the gifted copies seems to be a permanent fixture on a coffee table and considerably dog-eared. Great gift on its own to 'soon-to-be' parents, or put it in a basket with some bottles, a couple of bibs, baby t-shirt and plush toy and you've got a pretty terrific baby shower gift. 
this book bears an amazing similarity to 50,001 Best Baby Names, by Diane Stafford. But hers is better because it's the original. Shame on you 
The recipes were fun to make and very southern. Book is worth having in your kitchen, including for yankees 
After watching Paula Deen on the Food Network and then visiting her restaurant, The Lady and Sons in Savannah, I knew this cookbook collection was a must for our home. Her recipes are simple and delicious. There is something in there for everyone with new creations that delight the palette. Her chicken recipes such as Chicken Georgia, Chicken and Dumplings and Chicken Casserole are easy and delicious. The Corn Casserole was probably the easiest dish I have ever prepared and was gone immediately. It is a great sign in my home if you do not have leftovers. I do not have leftovers when I cook with Paula Deen. The only downside is we are having to exercise more because of this delicious food. I figure that it is a small price to pay for having enjoyable sit down dinners with the family. I would definitely endorse this collection for any home. This would be a great gift this Christmas season. 
FORGET what e brown says. What was this person thinking???? I will tell you that these are recipes that for the most part include ingredients that any southern cook will find on hand at any time. Simple, easy, and very tasty recipes that your family will love. If some appear to have a high fat content and that bothers you then use your brain and take measures accordingly. It really is that easy. 
To the lady who gave Paula's book a 1 star because it's all fattening salty foods--puhleeze! She said she watches the show--do you really? Paula is a southern cook and southern cooking is full of rich food; she always says her favorite food is butter! Her cookbooks are fantastic; every time I make something to bring to the office or to a potluck, I use one of her recipes and they always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. She's the tops 
Tried true favorites, along with some new ones. It doesn't get any more tasty or simple than the recipes in this collection. The two books together are a great deal cover just about anything you'd ever want to whip up in the kitchen. Even if cooking is not your thing, Paula's recipes are so yummy, they might help change your mind 
I cannot bring myself to cook anything from these books. The recipes include too much fat. Recipes that include large amounts of butter, cream, cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty. I'll bet they taste wonderful, however. Creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible. Also I resent having to use Paula's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients, eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them. I have watched the TV cooking programs and enjoyed them. The food she cooks has always looked delicious though rich. Paula's accent is lovely to listen to, and her presentation is beautiful. Photos of the finished dishes would have been extremely welcomed. Also, the quality of book paper was poor. I really should simply return the books and might do that. Only 1 star from me, if that. Disappointed. 
I bought this for my husband, but we both enjoyed it very much 
These two books are amazing. you want great southern food look no where else but paula deen. i love her show so much its set in the Tivo. if anyone is ever in savannah a visit to the lady and sons restuarant is going to be the best stop ever made. long lines so make sure to get there early to put your name on the list 
These cookbooks cover it all, Paula Deen is simply the Queen of southern cooking. I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves to cook! Only exception would be people who are really watching their weight, because Paula is also the queen of butter, and it's really hard to eat small portions :) 
This is the best cat care book i have ever read it really helped me with the deliver of my cats kittens and then the after care of them. It also halped me train my cat not to do cetain things like scratching the carpet and couch....you should get this if you have acat it really helps alot...... 
I read this years ago when it first was published and recommended it to friends and family. We all agreed that despite the unusual format, it was wonderful and we found ourselves quoting it to each other for months. Steve Kluger is an incredible write 
I've read this book countless times now. It is w/o a doubt my favorite read. I own 2 hardcopies and I've just ordered more paperbacks to give out as gifts. At $4.99 it is a steal. 
Let me state, for the record, I'm not a fan of baseball unless, of course, it's my husband or boys out on the field (and even then, I keep my mouth shut because I really don't know what I'm watching). That said, I wasn't sure how I'd do with this book, but I found myself heavily engrossed in it right from the first word and loved every bit of it. Kluger's humor and imagination kept me turning pages late into the night. Heck, I didn't even do that with the chick lit books I usually devour! I adored the way he told the story, through dialogue and letters, a pleasant twist that I really enjoyed. It took a great deal of courage, in my opinion, to bring the plot to its climax the way Kluger did. It could have gone in a number of other ways and brought back around to the conclusion just as easily without taking it to that extreme (nope, not going to give it away) -- but the fact that he did do it and was able to keep me reading to the very end despite making that move deserves a standing ovation. Job well done! Whether you're a big fan of the game, a baseball widow during the season, man or woman, this is a delightful, poignant coming-of-age story to add to your summer reading list ... or any other season's list. I highly recommend this book. 
If you read for pleasure, then this book is for you. A page turner in which you may ignore your favorite television show just so you may read the hysterical and brazen letters between the boy and his chosen recipient (the White House, a major league baseball player, etc). The book illustrates the development of father/son relationship between the boy and the baseball player. Charlie Banks, the Gentile baseball player, demonstrates true love for the boy by assisting him to prepare for his Bar Mitzvah. While reading this book, one could envision a movie depicting this wonderful story 
"Last Days of Summer" is a thoroughly moving novel. It reminds me of the movies "The Sandlot" and "My Summer Story," and of the play "Brighton Beach Memoirs." I'm not a fan of baseball, but that didn't stop me from loving this story. It's told through a series of letters, teacher/parent notes, flyers, posters, and newspaper clippings over the span of two years during World War II, and it was a smart way of telling the story. The humor is sarcastic and delightful, and you'll become engrossed in the relationships and friendships made. Because of this, you won't be able to stop crying (or at least get misty-eyed). I recommend 
So many books with boys as the central character have plots that center around athletics or some sort of heroic action. This one manages to keep those themes (baseball, a major war) and still make the story about a friendship. This book is very funny, but more importantly it is a special window into how people can make a difference in each other's lives. And a bonus is that the "letters to each other" format (who remembers what epistolary means anymore?) makes it an easy read 
I have been looking for this book for a while after my boss suggested we read this. I enjoyed it and I wanted to share it, but I couldn't remember the name, just the style and subject. Needless to say, I am getting it now, and sharing it often 
I read this book twice in the same week. I read constantly - anything and everything - but I've never done that before. I laughed so hard several times that tears were running down my face! I have recommended it to every person that I talk to that is a "reader." When working in a bookstore years ago, the publisher sent the book to us to read before it went on sale. I have no idea how many I actually hand sold, but it was a lot 
This is a great book i recommened for anyone in the 8th grade or in high school. I read this book because the cover and tittle sounded good but i read the first letter to Charlie Banks and I was hooked if you dont read the entire book you will miss it so don't just try spark notes read the book. 
I enjoyed the characters in this book. I loved the feelings you got from Sarah. And felt her feelings of just sticking with something because you don't want to rock the boat in case there isn't anything better for you! Moving on can be a scary spot to be in 
The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning. I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes Noble to get another one. Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition; I picked up on that before reading the reviews. There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor. For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world! They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel. Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility. Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000. The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather. Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers. They deserve better than this 
Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not! I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me. How bad could it be, right? Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day. The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing. The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing. Here are some suggested areas of improvement: - Shorten up the paragraphs. They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters. I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out. Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence. As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date. 
After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house. Aha, I thought, the story begins. But alas, not much happens. Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be. Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no. Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them. The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous. I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one. Where was the editor on this one? It was a bummer. Virgini 
Don't waste your time or money on this book. It was about as interesting as watching paint dry! Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
I just finished this book, and thought, "I could see where someone would say it was boring." But I just loved the story, loved the history of Sarah tracking down her great-grandmother, loved the details of the house (and was very jealous of such a nice house!), and all in all, this was one of the better of Danielle Steel's recent works. Yes, there was some repetition, but not as bad as "Impossible." I would say if you've been hesitating to pick up a Danielle Steel book lately, as I have, this one might actually be enjoyable!! Is she on her way back? I know we all hope so as we know she is capable of great work, that's why we stay her fans 
I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back. It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out. I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would. Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes. But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words "four years" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed. 
Kubler-Ross teaches us how to understand the death of a family member or loved one and how to cherish the final moments with them 
This book is one of the first great books that Dr. Kubler-Ross has gifted us with. Her insight and compassion are unremarkable. I am sad she won't be writing any more books though. Her latest book, "On Grief and Grieving" is a wonderful book also. There are some case studies to go by and it truly touches your soul. 
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross once again inspires us to learn how to care for those dying patients and their family members. This book assists our care and compassion through true life experiences of those dying. This book grabs at your heart and pulls you in! 
Each time people around me lost their family, I gave this book. Most of them said that it was a great help to recover from grief. I, myself experienced a hard time to accept mentally a familly member's death and the book gave me a relief, though I do not believe everything written in it 
Though written back in the 60's, this was a very interesting, thought provoking read on treatment of and interaction with people who are terminally ill. It gives valuable insight into why people act or do not act in certain ways and as to how they want to be treated when they are dying, children as well as adults. It also covers family interactions which are so critical to the patient's emotional physical state of being 
A book by one of the most eminent writers on the psychology of death and dying, this volume goes through what the dying have to say to doctors, nurses, clergy and their own families. Other than the introductory chapters on the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, this volume is devoted to the interviews given by severely ill and dying patients to a class of medical and pastoral care professionals and those studying to fill these roles. The course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy; thus there is a strong Christian element. First, this grated on me a bit because of its exclusivity, but I soon realised that patients who chose to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and a chaplain would probably do so because of an already existing faith, which put things in perspective. Munch of the information provided is enlightening and eminently current; much of the rest is dated - after all, this book was written in the late 60s. I was particularly interested in the reactions of staff and other professionals to course and its results - I would hope that, with the evolution of medical teaching, there would not be a little less resitance, but I cannot judge that. The second revelation were the family relationships and patterns revealed by the patient interviews - I'm currently studying family therapy ["Families and How to survive them" Skynnewr/Cleese] and this was highly relevant 
I haven't had a chance to read the book in its entirity, but have enjoyed what I have read. 
For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate "companion" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together. 
This book is very helpful to understand the overall grieving process. From counselor to doctor to family and ultimately, to a terminally ill patient, this book can be very helpful. Recommended highly 
Bereavement: Counseling the Grieving throughout the Life Cycle is a compact little book that covers the basics of grief counseling. Author David A. Crenshaw Ph.D. presents his theory of the tasks of mourning that must be accomplished in order for the grieving individual to attain a healthy resolution to the loss. These tasks appear to owe an acknowledgement to the five stages of grief proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. Crenshaw goes on to apply his seven tasks to six identified life cycle stages: preschool children, school-age children, adolescents, young adults, adults in midlife, and the elderly, using abbreviated case histories as examples. The book provides an overview of the grieving process and some basic suggestions for interventions with people in the various age groups. It does not, however, give the amount of in-depth information and hands-on detail that would be required to help a counselor develop proficiency in counseling the bereaved. In attempting to cover such a wide array of populations in a small book, Crenshaw sacrifices specificity. The longest chapter is devoted to the preschool aged child with the main thrust of his recommendations being monologues that the counselor delivers to the child. He only minimally mentions play therapy, arguably the most effective type of therapy for children in this age group. This reviewer finds the omission of play therapy techniques for the bereaved child to be the most serious lack in this book. Bereavement is an interesting and highly readable book that gives some good basic information. The counselor interested in developing effective grief resolution therapy skills would do well to use this book as a starting point from which to begin building her skills and then follow it with more in-depth publications devoted to the specific population she is counseling.

My husband and I are lawyers who have recently returned to reading Shakesepare, decades after college. We wanted literary criticism that was qualitative superior to the plot summary readers guide--criticism that would help us explore the imagery, themes and metaphors of the plays. Marjorie Garber is the answer to our prayers. We recommend to readers returning to Shakespeare that they purchase a paperback edition of each play with good notes to help with line specific language issues--the Arden series is the best-and then supplement/enrich the experience with Garbers insights. It is a pleasure for us to carefully read each play and then see what treasures she has mined based on her own reading and that of prior critics. We considerably prefer Garber to Bloom as a single compendium. Garber packs an enormous amount of insight into a single 30 page chapter. Shakespeare is surely worth the detail she provides. I would also suggest that you purchase the Ambrose DVD set of tapes of the great BBC plays--after you have read the plays it is wonderful to watch Jacobi et al. The DVD format enables captions which is very helful to savoring every line. 
William Shakespeare's immortal words will live forever. In this excellent book of criticism Professor Garber of Harvard examines each of the 38 plays from "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" through "The Two Noble Kinsman." Her work is detailed and insightful for anyone who seeks more knowledge and understanding of Shakepeare and his plays. As we explore Shakespeare we also learn more about what it is to be human being in the world! Garber writes about each play as she analyzes the characters and their motivation; the history of the play's production and how the play is related to other plays and characters in the Shakespearean canon. Along the way we learn the derivation of words used by the bard; what was going on in England and the world at the time the play was written and such various topics as sumptuary laws (dealing with clothing); class structure and the growth of the English language. Shakespeare's life is covered in an insightful introduction. Marjorie Garber must be a brilliant person to listen to in the lecture hall! I wish these insighful looks at each play would be available in tape format! Her book is a classic which should be required reading for anyone teaching Shakespeare in high school, college and adult education classes. I was fascinated by her depth of scholarship and ability to relate Shakespeare to our day. My highest appreciation to this wonderful book on our great treasure of poetry and the art of drama William Shakespeare 
This is a monster of a book packed full of insight into the plays of William Shakespeare. Another reviewer has criticized the way Professor Gerber tackles each play, but I think she pitches her analyses pretty spot on. As she describes a play she will stop and detour into some aspect of the cultural mores of the England of Shakespeare's day and come back. I find ( as a layman ) that is exactly what I wanted. I wasn't looking for Heavy Textual Criticism that might only be understandable to other Eng Lit Professors. This is an excellent book for the layman - if you are prepared to concentrate and forgive Professor Gerber when she does occasionally throw in a semantics term that you have never heard of - USUALLY she explains them. But not always. 
This is a wonderful, rich, exploratory book that holds nothing back; a meditation about the Shakespeare canon that resonates in all planes at once. It is certain to be [...] by college teachers everywhere, and so it should be; together with Shapiro's 1599 as a biography and a solid encyclopaedia like the Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, this is one of the only supplementary volumes you'd ever want to shelf next to the Complete Works. This is the kind of full-service critical homage and investigation Shakespeare has been waiting for all these years. I hope he and Marjorie Garber meet in Heaven, and that someone leaks the resulting sonnets 
Marjorie Garber's "Shakespeare After All" is first-rate scholarship on Shakespeare's plays. It is a 'must have' for anyone interested in Shakespeare's works - whether the person has a casual interest or a scholarly background. The information is conveyed in an accessible style. I have purchased a number of copies and given this work as gifts to friends. One should pick it up and read it before seeing any performance of the plays. Kudos, Ms. Garber! EXCEPTIONAL WORK ... MJ Moore Detroit 
As a fan of Shakespeare (both on the stage/screen and written page), I have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright. First there was Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare, which was a well-written commentary on the historical contexts of the plays. Then, there was Harold Bloom's Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, a scholarly work offset by a tone of high-toned intellectual snobbery and condescension. Now, there is Shakespeare After All, a work that fits between these two in quality. In Shakespeare After All, Marjorie Garber's 900+ page tome on the Bard's plays, we are given an opportunity to learn more of what makes Shakespeare Shakespeare. As a long-time Harvard and Yale lecturer on Shakespeare, Garber certainly has the credentials and experience to back up her extensive essays on the plays. If there is a problem with the book, it is only that she is perhaps too familiar with the plays and is unable to be truly critical of them. The book begins with a lengthy introduction which serves as a biography of Shakespeare and provides a bit of historical context for his body of work. Then we get a chapter on each of thirty-eight plays, including The Two Noble Kinsmen, which is not always included in Shakespeare collections. The plays are presented in rough chronological order and focus only secondarily on plot, with a greater emphasis on character and the use of language. Garber is a good writer, and each chapter is insightful. As this is written more as a collection of essays, there is not always perfect continuity between chapters and there is more than a little redundancy (which I suppose does make this easier to read this work in portions or out of order). As stated before, however, the principal flaw in her writing is that she refuses to say anything really critical about any of the plays. In Garber's view, Shakespeare batted 1.000, all hits and no misses. Henry VIII seems to be just as worthy of merit as Othello or Hamlet. Furthermore, there are no mistakes; any apparent contradictions or omissions are cleverly intended, not just an error. Certainly, Shakespeare is worth a lot of praise. When you consider what he did - writing over three dozen plays with an adeptness that is readily apparent - he is definitely deserving of the title "genius," but he wasn't perfect. It would be nice if Garber acknowledged this, but her strengths clearly outweigh her weaknesses, and if you are interested in learning more about Shakespeare's plays, this is a worthwhile way to get that education. 
I bought this book on the strength of Marjorie Garber's excellent past Renaissance scholarship. I was expecting something more theoretically informed and original, but as it is this is a very worthwhile book, and I predict it will be an essential reference book for teachers and students. It's a BIG book with a substantial chapter on each play (but not the sonnets), as with Harold Bloom's book on Shakespeare. Garber, however, is less idiosyncratic than Bloom; She synthesizes the best of recent scholarship, but without footnotes or extensive theorizing a la Derrida and Lacan. Garber combines close attention to language with valuable historical background and context. For example, in her chapter on Macbeth, she relates a "new critical" analysis of the clothing imagery to sumptuary laws regarding clothing (laws which served to enforce the social hierachy of Renaissance England). The strengths of this book are her comprehensive discussions of the play, which sum up what we know for sure about the plays including the relevant historical contexts, and her brilliant analysis of Shakespeare's language, i.e., close reading. While her work is illuminated by recent scholarship, she avoids the Stalinesque imperatives of political correctness. Compare Garber's intelligent discussion of the problem of gender in Macbeth with Stephen Orgel's "introduction" in The Complete Pelican Shakespeare, in which he reductively reads the play as a "misogynist fantasy." The only reason I docked the book one star is that, based on the chapters I've read so far, she doesn't really make a major original contribution to Shakespeare studies (in contrast to, for example, Greenblatt's recent bio of Shakespeare, Will in the World) so much as synthesize what we already know. All in all, a very valuable reference book that I will be consulting regularly in my college teaching. Highly recommended for high school teachers, English majors (undergraduate and graduate), and all fans of Shakespeare 
Clear and Present danger is an action packed and informing novel by Tom Clancy. It places you into the United States government fight the war on drugs. The government is stepping up its assault on teh druggies after the director of the FBI is killed in Bogota. A young staff sergeant Domingo Chavez joins the fight as a scout in an elite group of soldiers fighting the druggies directly. This book is excellent, both in its exciting storytelling and realistic twist. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys very technical writing, or anyone who enjoys a good action story.  
I'd go as far to say this is better than The hunt for Red October. Compared to the dire offerings Clancy serves up now such as Red Rabbit, this book is good enough to make you wonder if it was not written by a different author. The plotting is very tight, and action is nicely placed. At 600 odd words this is still a long book, but short for Clancy. The asassination of the American ambassador is as a couple of reviewers pointed out, not until about 300 pages in, but there is more than enough to keep your attention until then. Clancy's strong point was never characterisation, and some of his books I feel just sag with the weight of words (and extraordinarily long chapters). I remember reading other novels of his and skipping paragrapahs here and there. This one I didn't put down until I had finished it. Politically, it's his most sophisticated as well. I always feel that sometimes Clancy was too comfortable painting a picture of the US as whiter than white - here, he brings in elements of moral ambiguity as an illegal war is started in Columbia. There is still enough military hardware and action too keep you going as well - and not too much to overload you. Overall, I feel this is his best work, his most balanced and clever book. If he could produce something half as good as this, it would still be better than the tripe he has served up recently 
The Story of the book goes a high ranking U.S. offical is killed in Colombia, and the socking covet U.S. response. This is the fifth book in the Jack Ryan Series. Would recommend to anyone 
The book begins like modern headlines and top stories in the news: a Coast Guard boat discovers several dead bodies on a drifting boat out at sea ... piecing together the scenes ... the Captain and his crew understand the grisly details which became all too clear. Before the discovery, they announce their intention to board the boat, only to find two Columbians who speak little and look guilty as sin. The Captain and crew have the presence of mind to record on film permanently what the encountered. They nearly gag at what they find. Contrary to usual procedure, they create a "justice at sea" bogus trial based on some ancient mariner's manual. It is just the right scenario to create fear in their prisoners which extracts a confession from them that the Coast Guard believes will stand up in court and get them prosecuted. In Washington, DC clandestine operations are executed for a secret American plan to use the most talented night warriors the US Army has ever produced to fight the drug cartel in Columbia, on their own turf. The select group all have Spanish roots and were salvaged from a life on the streets, where they would surely work against the system, to build a clean life in the Army ... the better alternative. This book shows how power politics, secret hand-shake decisions, and behind the scenes operations occur which could shake up the core values of a country. Clandestine activities work outside the boundaries of national and international law. If they were made public, there would be a huge outcry from USA citizens and of the world judgement. It is at this time that Jack Ryan becomes Acting Director of the CIA. The CIA Director is in the hospital with a terminal illness ... The current president has not a clue of how the drug war is being fought and won. He is only aware of the results: drug cartel airplanes are being shot down and the US is winning. It is an election year, his main concern is gaining a positive standing in the polls and with world opinion. He knows very little of reality ... Meanwhile when the second in command of the drug cartel is discovered to have acted on *highly* classified information, known only to a *select* few, the accusations in Washington, DC fly. An insider investigation begins to discover where the leaks occured ... This book is nonstop action and difficult to put down. Each chapter reveals another complex episode which adds another layer of under-handed deals and shady activity, all of which make this a most satisfying reading experience. Although at times this novel is difficult to follow, the subject matter is contemporary and the unfolding events are highly plausible, making it one unstoppable page turner. The planning and execution of the ninja-styled warrior commandos is superb, the covert operations highly ingenious, the political subterfuge and communications are labyrinthine, shocking in their believability. Expect only the best from Tom Clancy ... you will never be disappointed. Erika Borsos (erikab93 
Well first off, I did not like the book nor the movie, both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art. On the other hand, I take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here, as some sound very anti-american in their reviews. We being good Americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not. We do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the American experience for that. If you do not understand this, TNEN BE QUIET ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
Veteran voice performer J. Charles is not only one of the most accomplished audio book narrators working today, he's also one of the busiest. Both listeners and publishers seem to know that if Mr. Charles lends his narrative skills to a production it's going to be highly listenable. An example is his rendering of this techno-thriller by the unparalleled Tom Clancy. Once again, Mr. Clancy tears his theme from today's headlines - our country's fight against drugs. As the story opens our commander In Chief isn't at all pleased with the progress being made in this battle. So, a formidable team is dispatched to Colombia to put an end to the struggle. It doesn't work as planned. Drug lords, as is known, show no mercy and they retaliate by killing civilians. A beleaguered President gives orders to not only end the original plan but to erase it. It should look as if it never existed. When Jack Ryan, now Deputy Director of for the CIA discovers that this aborted plan has been going on unbeknownst to him and some men have been stranded, Ryan decides to rescue them. In true Clancy fashion it's Ryan to the rescue, but it's a heart stopping struggle. - Gail Cooke 
Clear And Present Danger is OK at points, but the rest of the novel is boring with the CIA work, the action between the Commandos don't feel realistic, the story drags on on for hundreds of pages, the boring details of how big a ship is, that is boring! If you want to read a REAL and exciting novel, read Bob Mayer's Eyes Of The Hammer. Bib Mayer is a former Special Forces officer, the action is there, and is VERY EXCITING unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action. 
I'm a big Tom CLancy fan and i just loved every minute reading this book very well done. Very well written couldn't have been done better. Mr. Clancy always kept me on the edge and he is able to put in alot of great info and he knows soo much about alot of what he writes in his boo 
With some interesting twists and a complicated plot, this author grips the reader. Baseline story involves a good cop, a failed one who makes a living after resigning from the police force and struggles with a drinking problem, and a retired one who become involved after a murder hauntingly familiar to an unsolved one from many years ago by a serial killer who was never caught. In the course of attempting to solve the murder, a dirty cop is unearthed. The violent ending resolves part of the mystery. Along the way, good insight is offered into the lives of the police and their everyday struggles with the overwhelming crime rate in D. C. This author is widely admired for the pace of his novels, making them hard to put down. Crisp dialogue, excellent settings, and believeable characters as well as sharp observations about today's world make the book an excellent read. 
As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre. The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction. Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink? And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice. (Do they even make it anymore? I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist). And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames. You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed "Smiley" Jones if you never mention "Smiley" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname. That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned) 
I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted. The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc. Very disappointed 
IN THE FIELD OF CRIME NOVEL WRITERS, THERE ARE 5 CURRENT ONES WHO MAKE IT TO MY "A" LIST. TO QUALIFY THE WRITER HAS TO HAVE A UNIQUE WRITING STYLE ALONG WITH EXCELLENT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND,FINALLY, A PLOT TO DIE FOR. THE FIVE WRITERS,IMO,WHO HAVE BEEN MOST CONSISTENT IN REGARDS TO THE ABOVE ARE GEORGE PELECANOS,JAMES LEE BURKE,JAMES ELLROY,ANDREW VACHSS,AND ELMORE LEONARD.I'VE READ EVERYTHING THESE FIVE WRITERS HAVE WRITTEN AND BECAUSE THEY'VE RAISED THE BAR SO HIGH, IT'S DIFFICULT TO READ ANYONE ELSE. HOWEVER, I WILL ADMIT THAT BOTH ROBERT CRAIS AND DENNIS LEHANE ARE CLOSE TO BEING INCLUDED 
I haven't read every crime author's work, but I have read works by a number of those considered to be top echelon writers and, for my money, Pelecanos is the hands down best of the bunch. And of his work, The Night Gardener is one of the best novels. If this were a sporting event instead of a crime novel, ESPN would make it an "Instant Classic". It has great characters, a great plot, outstanding settings and surprises. It's a solid effort by a very gifted author. If you like crime novels, get on it. You won't be sorry 
In 1985, three teenagers are murdered in Washington D.C. Each of the victims have names that form palindromes - Otto, Ava and Eve. At the scene are T. C. Cook, hard-boiled Detective Sargeant and two near-rookies, Gus Ramone and Dan "Doc" Holiday. The Palindrome murders are never solved despite the obsession and skills of Cook. Flash forward to 2005. Gus Ramone is married now and has two mixed-race children. Dan Holiday left the police force under a cloud. T. C. Cook, long retired, has been forgotten by nearly all, along with the Palindrome murders. But Asa Johnson, 14, is found dead with a bullet through his brain. No gun. No witnesses. Could the Palindrome murderer be back after a 20 year absence? The hunt for the murderer of Asa Johnson is the leitmotif for this compelling, if sometimes very quirky,police procedural. Gus Ramone is the central character. No superman, Ramone is career cop. Not burned out, but not an over-acheiver either. Ramone, of Italian/Hispanic ancestry has a black wife, Regina, and two kids: Diego, 14, and Alana, 7. Gus loves his wife and children dearly. His love for them and the problems of bringing a mixed-race male through the storms of adolescence form the second leg of the story. Holiday and Ramone have a "history." Holiday is convinced he was a great cop and would have become a legenday cop if it weren't for the straight-laced Ramone in the Internal Affairs Division. Holiday discovers the body of the teenage Asa Johnson and phones the police anonymously. Holiday then teams up with the real legend, T. C. Cook to prove that the Palindrome murderer is back - and to capture him. This is the third leg of the story. The fourth leg is an unsparing tale of the black criminal subculture. This is not for the overly sensitive. These four themes support some of those most masterful storytelling I've seen in a long time. Pelecanos has the workaday world of the police down pat. No superheroics: just hard work, persistence and some specially skilled people like Bo Greene, who is able to talk murderers into confessing. Ramone has a special interest in the murder of Asa Johnson, not because it is his case - which it is not - but because Asa was a friend of his son. Ramone's work on the case leads down some dark paths, which also brings Pelecanos into some very strange and frankly hypocritical sermonizing. Saying anything more than that would be a spoiler and I won't do that. Concurrent with Ramone's investigation, is the work of Holiday and Cook. Ramone and Holiday seem to bewalking down the road to a showdown. Despite the unwelcome and unnecessary excursions into cultural politics, "The Night Gardener" is a terrific police procedural and a social commentary as well. Well worth reading. Jerr 
I have read everything Mr Pelecanos has written and generally find his work to be thoughtful and original. The Night Gardener is his best work to date. The stories are interesting and well paced. But it the characters and the subtlety with which they are drawn and brought together that makes this book special. The conclusion is thought provoking and important. It is true to the characters and believable. All in all a great book - Mr Pelecanos has packed so much into 372 pages, in itself this is an impressive feat. My previous favorite Pelecanos book was Shame the Devil 
When you think of crime fiction you think of cities and the writers who depict them in their books; Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Walter Mosley-Los Angeles...Carl Hiassen-South Florida...Lawrence Block-New York....Ed McBain-a city like New York and so on. No writer does Washington DC like George Pelecanos. He grew up there. He knows those gritty streets. This new book is a real departure for the author. Its the story of 3 cops who are trying to solve an ancient crime. one retired, one fired, the last, a veteran cop.. a family man. Years ago somebody was killing children and leaving their bodies near community gardens. Then it stopped. The three cops who were on the original cases went their separate ways. Then it starts happening again. Pelecanos crafts a noir thriller. Well worth the read 
Well guess what its Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He's back with Hermione and Ron. He's just discovered that he can talk to snakes but doesn't know why, until after a while they tell him he can speak parsel tongue (able to speak to snakes). This gets him into trouble because he goes into the girl's bathroom and starts to speak parsel tongue and it opens a secret door to the chamber of secrets. There he faces Tom Riddle and wins by destroying his journal 
An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale. Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
Still amazed by J.K.Rowlings writing and still in love with the book it's well worth the read. Too bad the movie kind of ruined it for me after. Thsi is one of the more scary Harry Potter even though i find it more suspensful and eventful. Read it . You'll like it. 
Great information and easy read. I learned more in one book than the other 5 I read on the heart and the things we can do to help heal. As a yoga instructor I will recommend this to my ailling students 
The view that all types of medicine (western and eastern) working together makes sense. This book seems to encorage a balance between both. I enjoyed it 
I think Dr Oz is a fantastic doctor and I have heard him speak on tv but I did not find any useful information in this book for my life 
this is the worst book i have ever read,,it is very dull and unuseful..i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it. i wish i can return it and get a refund..but i have threogh it in the tras 
Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book 
What is impressive about this book is the author's concepts of healing both heart and mind as he points out just how closely the two are interconnected. The writing style is one that will grasp the reader's attention from start to finish. The approach to holistic health is a welcome approach to healing. It is a concept that is gradually increasing in the health care field, but one that still has a long way to go before it is universally accepted by all physicians. More education and information needs to be provided in this area to all health care providers. Using the holistic approach, there can be fewer side effects from medication, less depression and a general feeling of well being during the most trying and difficult times. There is much to be said on combining Western and Eastern traditions in the process of healing. Our world can benefit dramatically from this approach and the author vividly explains why throughout the pages of this well-researched and superbly written book. It is highly recommended reading material and most deserving of a five star rating 
though need to get out the dictionary sometimes: mythopoetic gestures, profundity, epitome.... this is really excellent; looking forward to rereading the 20 cent copy of all the preety horses i just ordered with my girlfriend and this book's insights into this great writer (my favorite 
I like typing. I like seeing my words in print on the internet. I have a lot of time to waste. But all in all, it is a good book that is in ok shape for its age and was at a good price. 
This book if full of helpful information and is organized in a way that makes it easy to use for reference purposes. Give it a once through and then shelve it for reference purposes. This one is worth having in your management collection 
Any manager with hiring authority knows that selecting the "right" candidate for any position is a nerve-wracking task. Professional processes can help you screen, interview and review, but the final choice is often as much art as science. Author Martin Yate's basic book can help inexperienced managers hire effectively, although this useful primer on interviewing and hiring is a little wordy. Yates provides great detail about key steps, such as when to schedule a phone interview, what to ask and how to conduct an interview. He even provides numerous sample questions for each major job category, from entry level to management. Is it a little too basic? Perhaps for some, but we recommend it for new managers who are inexperienced at hiring. Although this book covers the fundamentals of hiring, it can't guarantee that you'll make the right choice every time. Then again, that book probably hasn't been written 
Like many small business people, I was a complete bozo at hiring for many years. Fortunately, at some point I woke up to that fact and decided to educate myself. I took classes, read books and did everything I could to become a skilled interviewer. Without question, one of the most helpful tools to escaping Bozoland was this book. Although I am now a freelance business consultant and have no employees of my own, I frequently assist my clients with their own hiring processes, and in so doing I still refer extensively to Martin Yate's excellent book 
This is an extremely well written and very useful book on hiring techniques and methods. The author analyzes all aspects of the hiring process beginning with the different types of resumes and when each type is used; what flags to look for and how to evaluate an applicant's overall resume. Chapter five focuses on short-listing through a `phoner' while the subsequent chapters are devoted to interviewing techniques and the science of asking questions. The author introduces four different interviewing techniques - Situational; personality profile; stress; and behavioral - and also gives a very useful and informative analysis of the different types of questions that can be asked in a hiring interview like half-right reflexives; hamburger-helper questions; and question layering. In the following chapters, the author focuses on evaluating the candidate's ability and willingness to do the job as well as manageability. The questions and the author's commentary on what to look for and red flags in an applicant's answer are informative, highly usable, and extremely useful. These are not your 'standard' interview questions (though there are some pretty standard questions included). They are well formulated and clever probes into the applicant's skills, knowledge, personality, and background. The rest of the book is devoted to functional areas with a chapter devoted to clerical, management, sales, contingency workers and law hires. Again, I found the advice and suggestions relevant and informative. In formulating the hundreds of question suggestions scattered throughout the book, the author has given a lot of thought to the qualities, experiences, and areas of concern that hiring managers and HR people focus on 
I use this book both for interviewing techniques and for preparing to be interviewed. Its a great book for interviewing because he presents the pros and cons of different techniques and gives what I consider to be a good framework for identifying quality candidates. Its a great book for preparing to be interviewed because it helps you identify the objectives of interviewers and make a better case. As a hiring manager, you should be able to pass an interview with flying colors, shouldn't you? Perhaps the most enlightening wisdom I got from the book was the enumeration of the qualities of a good employee: 1. Ability to do the job 2. Willingness to do the job 3. Manageability of the candidate Most interviews focus on the abilities of the candidates and stop there. Big mistake! Mr. Yate gives you guidance on evaluating the whole candidate, and in general I like and agree with his advice. Other good ideas are evaluating the cracks in resumes, phone screening, and lunch. Never hire anyone without checking background, verifying employment and education, and seeing if they can carry on a conversation at lunch. I draw ideas for interviews from several books, but this one is the overall framework that I have worked from. I feel the style is readable, the length is appropriate, and the content is excellent 
If you are looking for a solid foundation of your interview process, take a look at this book. It provides helpful ideas on how to approach your job candidates. Can they do the job, are they willing and can they be managed. It provided lots of helpful questions and processes for a successful hiring process. I have to say, that I am not a professional recruiter just someone that needs to hire and evaluate his new employees 
This book has that unique ability to make you feel as though you are learning something while, at the same time, make you feel like you knew nothing until you opened the book. Schaeffer is a good writer and has good observations 
Schaeffer adds yet another book to the "this is why christians have it right" category of literature. Though Christians, nor Schaeffer, by no means have a monopoly on such an approach; I found it to be especially unsettling in it's lack of insight into modernism. Picasso, we are told, failed. His artistic goal, to paint the unpaintable, the sublime, was never realized. First of all, to really understand 'modern' painting, we would certainly want to ponder the birth of photography and its influence on illustrative painting. Illustrative painters were experiencing an identity crisis brought on by the industrial revolution, much like the rest of the entire world except good old Schaeffer. Artists turned to the 'sublime' because they needed to discover what painting could do that photography could never do: show the unshowable. And so Picasso's paintings become less 'realistic;' they imply movement, they imply other ways of seeing than the symbolic boxes the modern and postmodern worlds are born into (again, except Schaeffer). To say Picasso failed suggests no appreciation for any of this, nor does it seem Schaeffer took the time to really analyze a cubist painting, how is it different from what came before? Why? What does it show that a photograph could not? What does it 'IMPLY'! etc. The analysis of Picasso suggests not an inkling of thought as to why cubism came about FOR CUBISTS (and modernists in general) except for how it makes no sense to a Christian. Thus, the "this is why Christians have it right" feel of the critique. I cannot imagine anyone who has appreciated a modern painting or read anything about modern artists swallowing this. Rather, it is for people who find modernism pointless to be able to say, "oh, they're lost, that's why it makes no sense." Lastly, Paul himself claimed that "we see through a glass darkly." The Jews of the Torah (read Old Testament) could not even utter the name of God because of that being's supreme mystery. Composers from Palestrina to Bach attempted to 'imply' something above and beyond their actual art. That is what good art does, Mr. Schaeffer. To say someone failed because they never actually got to the sublime, they never actually clearly illustrated it, never fully understood it, is to indict Paul himself. Paul admitted his limitations, it is a shame Schaeffer did not turn some of that powerful insight in on himself. Why do you criticize the speck of dust in your brothers eye, when you have a log in your own? 
The idea of the project How Should We Then Live?, both as a film documentary and as a book, was conceived in 1974 and completed in 1976. In the Acknowledgments, Francis Schaeffer writes about the idea behind the project: "Using my study, over the past forty years, of Western thought and culture as a base, we could attempt to present the flow and development which have led to twentieth-century thinking, and by so doing hope to show the essential answers." The subtitle to How Should We Then Live? is "The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture." Starting from ancient Roman times, tracing man's development throughout the Middle Ages, going to the Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment, he shows the steps which led to the modern era. CHAPTER SUMMARIES Chapter One-Ancient Rome The finite Graeco-Roman gods were not a sufficient inward base for the Roman society: Rome crumbled from within, and the invasions of the barbarians only completed the breakdown. Chapter Two-The Middle Ages The Middle Ages were the post-Roman age: a time of uncertainty in which there were great advances of the church but also great distortions of Biblical truth, eventually leading to the Renaissance and the Reformation. Chapter Three-The Renaissance Although the Renaissance revived the realization that man and nature are important, it went overboard by making man the measure of all things-and by that destroyed the importance of man. Chapter Four-The Reformation Like the Renaissance, the Reformation sought to bring freedom to man, yet unlike the Renaissance it did not lose sight of the Bible and absolute values. Chapter Five-The Reformation-Continued The impact of the Reformation on society at large was the opportunity of freedom without chaos. Chapter Six-The Enlightenment The Enlightenment believed in the perfectibility of society, and sought to bring it about mainly by the means of revolution. Chapter Seven-The Rise of Modern Science Modern science could only have arisen from a Christian foundation: namely, that man is not part of a closed system but can observe and act into the system. Chapter Eight-The Breakdown of Philosophy and Science The foundation in Philosophy and Science was changed from antithetical thinking to dialectic thinking-and because of it reason became more and more pessimistic. Chapter Nine-Modern Philosophy and Modern Theology Due to the pessimistic view on reason, Philosophy and Theology started to seek meaning in the irrational. Chapter Ten-Modern Art, Music, Literature, and Films What began in Philosophy now made itself felt in the Arts: the abandonment of reason and increased fragmentation. Chapter Eleven-Our Society We have come full circle, since our society has become like the declining Roman Empire of old: it is marked by the love of affluence, a widening gap between rich and poor, an obsession with sex, freakishness in the arts, and an increased desire to live off the state. Chapter Twelve-Manipulation and the New Elite Because our society stands on the verge of chaos, we are in danger of coming under an authoritarian elite which will increasingly manipulate our lives. Chapter Thirteen-The Alternatives The only plausible alternative to authoritarianism is to align ourselves to a Biblical worldview-a worldview which produces freedom without chaos. CONCLUSION Whether or not one agrees with all of Schaeffer's points, his passion to be a Christian who engages secular culture has laid the foundation stone for much of Christian thinking in the past three decades. 
While my own convictions are not reflected in Schaeffer's books, he always presents a thoughtful challenge to those who would disagree with his positions. This book is no exception. For a broader view of the nature of morality, see my "Morality: Does 'God' Make A Difference?" where I show why and how belief in God makes a difference--for good or ill 
In this book, Schaeffer illustrates that the reason the world is in such disarray is because we no longer have a moral and ethical foundation to build upon. This book explores the paramount philosophic, religious, and scientific ideas from the decline of Rome until the 1960s. He claims that in order to understand where we are today we must trace these three lines in history. He begins with the decline of Rome (with its amalgamation of Greek values) and proceed through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Romanticism, Industrialism, Modernity, and the post-modern world. Not only does Schaeffer explore the history of Western philosophy, religion, and science, but also history art, culture, cinema, Christianity, humanism, and communism. Furthermore, there is a flow to history that is rooted in people's thoughts. Their thought-world determines how they act. The results of this thought-world (or world view) impact the external world. Schaeffer points out that individual people throughout the establishment of Western culture impacted the external world with their lives. These impacts led to the present culture that we live in now. Many of these individuals shaped our culture to reject a Biblical foundation with absolute morals and ethics to live by. Instead of this moral foundation, the West is now functioning on top of a feeble, relative foundation. Schaeffer asserts that this is the reason our culture is in its current hysteria. He basically divides man and his view on the world into the two categories of belief in an infinite God (Christianity) and belief in the absence of an infinite deity (humanism). The book provides evidence proving that the Christian belief promotes a solid basis for morals, ethics, and order; however, humanism promotes relativism and chaos. It is on this basis that Schaeffer proves that without Christian principles, a culture is doomed to failure. He points out that Christianity gives meaning and beauty to all individual and corporate life. Anything Short of it brings death to every aspect of life. Because of this, Schaeffer is not hesitant to point out that the cure for society rests in Christianity alone. This book was written so that we would "turn from the greatest of wickedness, the placing of any created thing in the place of the creator, and that this generation may get its feet out of the paths of death and may live." The style Francis Schaeffer adopted is straightforward and logical. He openly admitted that his book does not make a pretense of a complete history of western culture, but enough historical evidence is used to prove his point effectively. Schaeffer developes his arguments based on the basis that ideas (or worldviews) act on the cause and effect theory. He also compares and contrasts the Judeo-Christian worldview with secular views to further develop his argument. Overall, the argument presented is proved in a coherent way. Although flow of the book is smooth and easy, it also includes a logical message that is vital to the western world. How Should We Then Live? Is a book directed at the West. As the people of the Western culture we would do well to listen to the message this book portrays. As Schaeffer effectively points out, if we do not take heed and return to a Biblical moral foundation, the world, as we know it, will continue to spiral down a one-way path to destruction. I highly recommend this book, and if the intended audience would take caution, and listen to that it is declaring, then it would save us from turmoil and destruction. This book points out the problem and the remedy. It would be foolish for a person who has cancer to turn down a remedy that would heal him. It would also be irrational for is to ignore the cure for our disorderly culture. 
Not many people know that there was a 10 episode film series with the same title, and that there is a paper back study guide that compliments this book. I first read this book 22 years ago when I was trying to figure out why the world was going to hell in a handbasket. It answered a lot of my questions and made me ask more questions. I rate this as one of the 10 most important books I've read in my lifetime, and I'm getting to be an old lady now. I'm getting ready to read it again because I feel it has a new relevance for our time in light of the persecution of Christianity in the public arena. I also bring to your attention his book, A Christian Manifesto. If you seek true wisdom born of knowledge, this is your book 
Francis A. Schaeffer covers a lot of territory both geographically and in terms of subject matter in this book. Chronologically he starts with ancient Rome and goes to the 1970s, the time the book was published. Illustrations are included to assist in making his case. Schaeffer contends there is a flow or pattern to history and in this book he sets out to explain the flow of Western culture. On page 52 he discusses the role philosophy had in separating the influence of divine revelation as found in the Bible from man-made epistemology. He uses Raphaels' painting of "The School of Athens" (c. 1510) to illustrate the separation. Symbolically the painting depicts two viewpoints, one looking upward toward God, the other viewing lower sources such as man. In Europe this gravitation toward one or the other direction took the forms of the Reformation (God) and the Renaissance (man). He discusses the philosophies of the prime movers in each of the two schools of thought. On page 108 he notes "Many good things in England came from Scotland." One of them being the concept of "Lex Rex: Law is King." The concept was that no one was above the law, that it was the same for everyone regardless of rank or position. He traces the idea for the American Revolution back to these seeds planted in the minds of those of English ancestary. The reader is carried up to the 1970s. This is a thought-provoking book that helps a person see cause-and-effect consequences over the long haul. It reminds one of the observation of Russell Kirk, "ideas have consequences. 
Far from reducing the Islamic Republic of Iran to some kind of timeless expression of Islamic culture, tradition, or identity, the author demonstrates the competing ideological influences that shaped the Islamic Republic -- not least of which were Western notions of political particpation. The author does a good job of showing how these tensions are reflected in the reform movement, and in the struggle for power currently unfolding in Iran. Thus I found the book very useful. I would only add that the author may have given insufficient attention to the power of the conservative clerics 
Despite the breathless headlines about the latest billion-dollar merger, most mergers don't work. In fact, more than half of all mergers fail, derailed by a common set of pitfalls. Companies merge without considering how they'll integrate after the deal; they don't communicate properly with their employees, and executives don't make decisions quickly enough to placate frightened workers. The executives who navigate mergers effectively are those who communicate well, deal with ambiguity and make decisions in times of instability. Author Price Pritchett offers an easily digested primer on the hazards of mergers, and lists hints for avoiding common problems. The authors provide plenty of concrete examples showing how such companies as Sony, Wells Fargo and the Chicago Sun-Times suffered from the dilemmas that accompany mergers. We ... recommend this comprehensive guide for managers on both sides of a business marriage. Caution: Read After the Merger before you merge 
This book should have been an short magazine article. The authors basically dissect one concept over and over and over: change is disruptive. There is very little useful information in this book. It points out all of the obvious and frequently-stated problems that come with change - productivity suffers, commitment is lost, etc., etc., etc., but gives no insight in how to fix the problems (unless you count these golden nuggets- "Keep your eye on the ball" and "Provide direction"). The one chapter that I hoped would shed some light on tactics - "Integration Project Management" - was pure fluff. It offered such pearls of wisdom as "It is helpful to look at the integration process as a logical sequence of steps designed to help bring the two organizations together." Not only is this a "Duh" statement, but it shows up in chapter 8! I would expect to read something like that in the introduction. And chapters 5 and 6 state that you should evaluate key talent in the aquired firm - but no where in these chapters does it tell you how to do it! I guess you have call up Pritchett &amp; Associates (and fork over big $$) for the details. My only guess is that the authors kept the book generic on purpose so that companies would call and ask about their consulting services. My advice: save your money for a real book, and just call up Pritchett &amp; Associates for their marketing literature 
I find it suprising how so many people can not like this book? I read it immediatley after reading book 1 and still thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the details the author gives...it makes you feel like you are right there, and understand and see things as well as the characters do. I can't wait for book 3, and hope everyone at least gives this book a chance and enjoys it as much as I did. Despite the reviews.. 
I don't know why some people are criticizing this book as badly as they are. Like all fantasy books and stories, if you strip them down far enough you get the same basic story. Characters are whats important in these books, and, while Eragon has much in common with Luke Skywalker they are different people with different personalities and experiences. To give this anything less than 3 stars is pure hateration. Lay off the haterade, this book continues the trilogy very well. The training was a little dull and the romance subplot leaves a lot to be desired, but this is a good, well-written (especially for his age) novel. I look forwarded to reading the 3rd and final installment 
"Eragon" was a great book, and much like a previous reviewer said, I read it rather quickly. It was action packed and suspensful. Eldest does a good of furthering the trilogy, and has a lot of action. Paolini leaves many questions unanswered, so you can expect an amazing final book in the series. However, despite the action, Eragon's training is incredibly boring, dull, tiresome, any other adjective that is synonymous to "zzzzzzz". The worse part is, that his training is half the book! There are a few good training sessions, but these are actually outside the training (if you haven't read the book you might not understand what I am getting out). Overall, it was still a good novel; and I really don't know why someone would even consider giving it anything lower than 3 stars 
Eragons journey continues in this 2nd book from Christopher Paolini. Although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well. I have been reading this series to my boys and with the exception of having to explain quite a bit of the vocabulary, they have been enraptured by the story. We can't wait for book number three 
The story continues, with Eragon being trained by the elfs, his brother Rowan becoming involved, leading up to a great battle with a surprising twist. Delightful read. You learn a lot more about the humans, elfs, dwarfs, dragons, and urgals. Can't wait to see how it all ends 
Yukio Mishima is, sadly, known best for the circumstances of his death. He committed seppuku (ritual suicide by sword) after finishing the final book of this tetralogy--The Sea of Fertility. He, along with Kawabata and Murakami, is one of the most prominent Japanese authors that actually gained attention during his life. Mishima was called a radical, a right-winger. Some think that this stigma affects his writing greatly, but hearing someone say that makes me wonder why they're reading him to begin with. SPRING SNOW is the story of Kiyoaki Matsugae, and his Imperially sanctioned and revered family. I thought that it was clear early on that Kiyoaki was an interesting character. He is the image of adolescence in this novel; Honda, Kiyo's best companion (I don't go out of my way to call him a friend), is, I think, more respectable. I'm not sure if Mishima, in writing this novel, was masochistic with Kiyoaki and more level-headed with some of the other characters, but it certainly gives us a great perspective in what goes on in Kiyoaki's mind. Kiyo and Satoko were childhood friends; after his interest in her wanes, he's given notice that she is to marry a Prince. "The grass always looks greener on the other side"--this is what I think of, looking back on Kiyo and his decision to tell his father that there was "absolutely nothing" between himself and Satoko. He goes on to become more infatuated with her presence; "doomed as it was inevitable" is what the synopsis says of this romance. The reason I give this 4 stars? I really felt the book could've been 50 to 75 pages shorter. I couldn't help but get tired of it in places. Another reviewer mentioed that Mishima isn't very inventive, but is very skilled. I agree with that totally. The story itself is not enough to warrant a reading (seriously--I've read countless other Japanese novels with the exact same romance-based-on-family-strain plot). It's the way that Mishima tells us of his characters, and the settings. I might go as far to say that--yes, I think that he is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. All complaints aside, this novel is amazing, and I feel that I'd appreciate it even more if I paged through it again. Mishima writes with a beauty that is hard to categorize; it's not really comparable to Murakami or Tanizaki, or any other famed Japanese authors who are still hailed today. Mishima carried with him demons. And angels! And their chorus is in these pages 
This is the first of a group of four novels by Mishima called The Sea of Fertility. Taken as a group they are excellent novels or even what one might call a literary masterpiece. The four books are: - "Spring Snow," - "Runaway Horses," - "The Temple of Dawn," and - "The Decay of the Angel." I asked another reader if Mishima's book "Spring Snow" was a universal story or a period piece unique to Japan. They were a bit uncertain. The good news is that it is both. It is a modern 20th century version of Romeo and Juliet - or a similar type of theme but not identical to Shakespeare's drama by any stretch - but having said that, there are many parallels. It is set in Tokyo around 1912; it involves two families and two lovers; there is a problem betrothal involving the female protagonist Satoko (Kiyoaki is the male); and there are outside forces at work - the Royal family. To say more would be to give away the plot. I am not an expert on Japanese literature but I thought that it rated 5 stars. It is a clear and compelling read, and I sat down glued to the book and read 270 pages the first day. For that reason - along with the beauty of the story and the scenery and the characters - it deserves 5 stars. As I reached the end of the book, I thought that the story faltered slightly. Also, the author is great but perhaps not brilliant nor very innovative. He is touted as being "like Dostoevsky" on the book jacket - a quote from the Christian Science Monitor. Yes, there are some fabulous scenes and excellent writing that transports the reader to Japan, and a rickshaw ride through a snowy spring afternoon. But, before reading the book, I had just finished reading the masterpiece Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, and some short stories by Chekhov. In comparison, Mishima's love story seemed a bit light compared to Dostoevsky, but perhaps on par with Chekhov. That is not a bad comparison. In reading the prose, I had the same feeling reading this book as I did when I read some of Saul Bellow's books, especially Herzog. Mishima seems to put a lot of emotional energy into the writing and he says things that are a bit on the edge of social norms. In a society such as Japan, the book must have been a bit racy when it came out. Is it a world class masterpiece? Probably not on its own, but it is exceptional. Taken as a group of four, The Sea of Fertility group might be a masterpiece series. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend the read. As a final note, this book has no introduction or extra notes on the author or the book. It is just the basic book, but it seems to be an excellent translation 
This tetralogy is the best source I've come across about the Consciousness-Only School of Buddhism. In a doctrinaire-free, passionate and beautiful story, you come to really understand what Budhist doctrines about reincarnation mean. Top rating 
"Spring Snow" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written, as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right. It is an eloquent, moving story with a "tale as old as time," that of star-crossed lovers who's love transcends social roles and obligations. In another culture, with another writer, this would be a romantic, if not happy, story. But this is Japan, and the writer is Mishima Yukio. In his hands, the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes, and become agents of their own happiness and destruction. By the very nature of their relationship, raised together since childhood, playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension, their future is never in doubt. It is impressive that a writer such as Mishima, known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams, could craft such a tender love story. While knowing the eventual conclusion, the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko, and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared. Not that it is a clear path. Even knowing Japanese literature, and the road it usually takes, there are surprises on the way. Things do not turn out the way one would expect. I was incredibly moved by "Spring Snow." It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader, and lingers long after the last page is turned. 
This is not an intent to (summarize) mishima's sea of fertility... rather it's an approach into analyzing it ... a sort of reading between the lines... Then ... again, what are we exactly trying to portray? we would say we are ( intending ) to deliver a semiotic vision of what the sea of fertility represents ... we are not trying to ( read ) it for our reader , rather , we let him read , and help him amidst it , by presenting a cluster of signs , keys , semiotics , call it whatever you want , that would - at the end - clarify the road , and that can be grasped by the reader so he can get a wider vision , and a better comprehension of this gigantic universe , which mishima called ( sea of fertility ) ... But first, why is this bizarre title (sea of fertility)? mishima himself is going to answer this question , to give it the first ( leading ) sign , that we should know it doesn't crack secrets for us , but merely provides us with a minimum limit , which we can begin our journey from .. in a note mishima sent to the famous American criticizer Donald Keene , he clearly admits that the reason for choosing this title for his tetralogy is a hint for an area of the same designation on the moon's surface not so far of ( the sea of silence ) ... the reason for this reference is to aim at a ( contradiction ) between this vivid and colorful name , and the wasteland it stands for in real ... we can go further on saying that this title combines the image of universal nihilism with the image of ( sea of fertility ) ... in summer 1945 mishima wanted to write an immense oeuvre that would sum up Miller's famous trilogy ( the rosy crucifixion ) , and that would stress more and more on that ( dark ) side of art ... to write a novel that would take six years of his life , and that would cover - chronogically - those sixty years from 1912 and on .. That decision , which was the most important one in mishima's practical life , obliged writing this novel in four volumes , in each an individual story , for each a special protagonist , but these characters would not be totally separated from each other ... How? The figure in the first volume is the lad kiwaki, the noble descent of the wealthy family of Matsugai, lives a love story, one of its kind that memory would not forget easily, and his friend Honda stands as an eye witness for this superb experience of his... From that point on , in every volume that succeeds, we can notice that the hero is merely the first one, but after being (reincarnated), to start a new cycle of life, and to let Honda only figure out the connections that ties these four characters... Mishima Knew very well that his Tetralogy is a rich threshold for everything he learned as a writer ... he told his friends, that when he finishes it, there is only one thing left for him to do ... (suicide) ... and by taking his own life in November 25th 1970, he fulfilled his final quote: the life of men is short, I want to live forever... ( The sea of fertility ) is not an easy read nor its a happy one , it is a lament melancholic presentation of life ... rendered by an artist ... 
For a Japanese nationalist, Yukio Mishima seems to have had an appreciation for European literature, as demonstrated in his wonderful novel "Spring Snow," the first part of a tetralogy. Taking place in Tokyo in the years following the Russo-Japanese war and just before the first world war, it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed nineteenth-century epic with an almost Tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a Stendhalian romance. Appropriately, one of its themes is the gradual influx of Western influence on Japanese culture, which Mishima, himself loyal to the Samurai tradition, might well have resisted. Most of the novel's characters are members of the aristocratic society of imperial Japan. One of these is Kiyoaki, the eighteen-year-old son of the Marquis Matsugae, a noble of the royal court. Kiyoaki is a handsome boy who attracts many girls but is too sullen and withdrawn to make many friends at school; as it is, his only companion is a bright classmate named Shigekuni Honda who works hard to please his strict parents by studying law. Kiyoaki has a tutor named Iinuma who secretly disrespects his pupil because he feels that Kiyoaki, representing the moral decadence of the new era, dishonors his ancestors and the dignity of old Japan. There are also two Siamese princes who through diplomatic channels are acquainted with the Matsugaes and attend Kiyoaki's school; they make a comical duo, at least until the tragedy that calls them home to Siam. The story pertains mainly to the troubled love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko, the daughter of Count Ayakura, whose family is close to the Matsugaes and lives on a nearby estate. Kiyoaki and Satoko were playmates in childhood, so it is no surprise that adolescence has brought mutual romantic feelings. However, her assertive and unsubmissive attitude offends his pride; he cannot envision her as his wife. After he spurns her, she accepts a marriage proposal from Prince Harunori Toin, a high-ranking military officer; the engagement is formalized by receiving official authorization from the Imperial Household Ministry. Satoko, aware that Prince Harunori is a dispassionate drone, consents to continue seeing Kiyoaki, their trysts aided and abetted by Honda and her maidservant Tadeshina, until one day when she wakes up with morning sickness. Imagine the imminent scandal--a young lady soon to be a princess in a marriage sanctioned by the Empire, pregnant by another man before her wedding! How could she be so irresponsible, and how could Kiyoaki have such contempt for imperial honor? This volatile situation involving the reputations of both the Matsugae and the Ayakura families advances the story to a nearly Shakespearean plateau, particularly when Satoko, heeding Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, gets herself to a (Buddhist) nunnery. Kiyoaki's desperate effort to visit her in the convent during the unseasonable weather indicated in the title ends the novel with a delicate poignancy. "Spring Snow" is a masterly composition that portrays a picturesque Japan in transition from the grand ceremoniousness of the imperial aristocracy to the new Europeanized etiquette. The wealthy Japanese are teaching English in their schools, driving British cars, wearing British clothes, listening to German music on German gramophones, even celebrating Christmas without ostensibly observing Christianity. Mishima, perhaps identifying himself with the discontented Iinuma, may have seen this as cultural degeneration, but his chronicle implies nothing disastrous about the beginning of the century in which his country, bolstered by the prosperity of its elite, was to become a world power. 
Mishima's Spring Snow is a rare jewel of a work! The passion, tragedy and intensity of this novel left me wanting to pursue the entire 'Sea of Fertility' series. I will shortly be reading 'Runaway Horses' which follows it, but have been forewarned not to expect anything quite on the scale of 'Spring Snow.' Luckily, this doesn't concern me, Mishima's writing style is visual, entrancing and magnetic. He takes hold of your imagination, curiosity and emotions from the very first chapter, and you just can't stop till the final page. I myself was dreading reaching the final page of Spring Snow, as I knew that to read such a glorious book again may not come for a long while. To me the book could have been twice the length and it still would have been too short. But that's the problem with things of such beauty and magnitude - you never want them to end. Sadly, you know they will - and they must. What they leave you with is unforgettable! GREAT! 
Most of what I read is modern. The stories take place in the here and now, and are dialogue-heavy. It's nice to read something "old-fashioned," where the words are important. If this were a story of privileged young Americans, I wouldn't be interested; but change the country and the era, and the same story becomes interesting 
This is the beginning of the posthumous work of Mishima. You will follow the lives of four people who got reincarnated in different time and in different place with Honda. His flowing and elegant style hits the highest and psychological descriptions, that even characters did not realized themselves so well, are so elaborated and sometimes scare us. It seems like weaving beautiful tapestry and you can feel the person of genius and bliss for enjoying the output of the genius. But you may lost at the end like this story and come back to this story again and again 
I would give this book a zero, if it were possible... Anyone that wants to follow this book is more than likely screwing up their child. I would consider "Doctor" Ezzo's philosophy a form of child abuse. This thing is the most awful, upsetting piece of parenting literature I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand, WHY would parents not want to go to your baby at night when he is crying? WHAT is wrong with loving your baby, cuddles, and attending to their needs??? Oh, yeah I forgot....American parenting seems to given way to the form of training your baby like a puppy, fitting "convieniently" into your lives, with alot of distance, no empathy, No trust, little to no communication, little emotional bonding, and in the future, this results in children who have attachment problems in later life, trouble regarding relationships, and practically seem to be teaching them to be independent and self sufficient from the time they are brought home from the hospital.... How heartbreaking. Sorry, I don't beleive in the form of abuse as this book is about. and I wish more parents felt the same as I do. 
This book has made me a more confident mom. Every thing my son goes to do is so easy and I believe it is because of Babywise. He slept through the night for the first time at 6 weeks and was consistently sleeping through the night by 11 weeks. He naps great and is so easy to take care of. I have the 2nd Babywise book and about to purchase the 3rd- Toddlerwise. I recommend this book to any new mom who is seeking to get her baby on a schedule and it also contributed to me nursing my son for 7 months. I was about ready to give it up when I read the book b/c I felt like a human pacifier. This book will encourage your baby to take the feedings at scheduled times. 
Hi I am the mother of twin preemie fraternal twins which are now 8 months old. My oldest twin weighed 2.4 and the youngest 4.8 lbs. My boys were hospitalized for 6 weeks. When we brought them home I thought wow, I really have them on the right track. My youngest boy would whale everynight no matter what. I tried swaddling, holding, everything, nothing worked. Until, someone gave me this wonderful book. I applied this book the night I recieved it. I saw results immediately. This book has taught us how important feeding on a 3 hour routine schedule everday, was super important! in the length they would sleep at night. Had my boys had healthy weights, they would of been sleeping all thru the night starting at 7 WEEKS. Instead, we had them sleeping thru at 3 months old. We have such happy boys. They smile all the time and to everyone they see. So well mannered no tantrums. This book is a god send and I recommend it to anyone. If it works with twins it will work for anyone. Stick with it and you will be amazed. I order every book they have written and it fantastic 
This book is highly recommended by our church and all of our friends SWEAR by this method. It is a little on the "strict" side, as far as scheduling goes. We also read "The Baby Whisperer" (which is more relaxed- less rigid) and are planning to take what works for us from each book, as they both offer some great principles. They both follow the same pattern routine of Eat, Activity, Sleep, then time for Mom Dad. 
After observing many parent friends and the sanity of their homes I decided BabyWise was definitly worth reading. My friends with the happiest well adjusted and well behaved children use BabyWise. My friends who oppose BabyWise and feel it is wrong or evil have never personally read the book from cover to cover but have only adopted the opinions of naysayers. Also, many of these have children sleeping in their beds between mom dad until they are 4 years old, are cranky, needy chilren and live chaotic lives. My husband and I read the book during my pregnancy and found it to be very balanced. We implemented the suggested guidelines with flexibility, as suggested, and we've had fantastic results. Our son has slept through the night in his own bed since 8 weeks. When we lay him down for naps or bedtime he goes right to sleep. When he wakes up he is full of smiles and giggles. In the 8 months he's been alive we've flown with him 7 times and been on multiple road trips. Everyone we encounter says, "Wow, he is the happiest baby I've ever seen." and "Does he ever cry? He travels so well." Through our travels and our business we've met many Docs and one child Psychologist whom have expressed the same compliments about our son. When I tell them we use BabyWise they often raise an eyebrow and express their disdane for this book and their opionion of it's rigidity. I recommended that they read it for themselves and not simply the opinions of naysayers. The proof is in the pudding. Thank you Gary Ezzo for such a fantastic book!! 
First off: My wife and I tried Babywise several years ago because we were sleep deprived beyond all belief. Please don't make the same mistake. Your baby will start sleeping better, I swear. Other parents we know have tried Babywise and the results of ranged from abandoning the philosophy to seriously altering their children's psyche. Babywise may "work" for many families in the sense that you *might* get your newborn to sleep through the night. But it is a very rigid and inflexible parenting style, and over the long run I have seen it result in resentful children. In the short term it is very hard on both baby and parent because the baby will be miserable, and you will feel guilty. Before buying into this philosophy, remember that has been subject to widespread criticism, and while it *might* work in the sense of getting your baby to sleep, it is, in this reviewer's opinion, very dangerous over the long haul and shortsighted on the part of tired parents. At the very least, please ask your pediatrician for their honest assessment of this book before trying it. If you are looking for a far better, and far more credible, book on parenting, try either Doctor Spock's Baby Child Care, or the American Academy of Pediatrics Caring for Your Baby Young Chil 
I strongly recommend new parents thoughtfully consider Baby Wise in developing your parenting style. Now parents of a 5-month old, we used parent directed feeding (PDF from Baby Wise) from the day we left the hospital and have been pleased with the results. BabyWise claims that that the PDF method will often result in happy, well adjusted, satisfied, children that are pleasant to be around. We have found this to be the case. My one gripe with the book is the lack of scientific, empirical studies on the PDF parenting style. Unfortunately, the book (and I) can only give anecdotal evidence of the merits of PDF based on personal experiences. Born in the 25th percentile weight/height, our little one was on a predictable schedule within a week, consistently sleeping (7 hours) through the night within 7 weeks and has been sleeping 11 hours at night since 12 weeks. When in public, we often get comments that our baby "is so happy" and "content." We go out to eat several times a week - without more than smiles and laughs (we have only left a restaurant once - but were able to do so before he cried). We house-hunted 9 hours a day for a week (in and out of the car 10-15 times) and our real estate agent never heard the baby cry - no pacifier. We have been on five multi-hour plane trips without any more than a giggle and coo. One friend was reluctant to hold our baby because she said that "babies always cry when I hold them." Our little one was pleasant and smiley. Does our baby ever cry? Of course! He cries at least one time every day (usually during his predictable "fussy time" - a 45 minute stretch before bedtime.) When he does cry, diagnosing the problem is pretty simple with PDF (I'll let you read the book to find out how) - and I still haven't figured out how to differentiate types of crys as the hospital suggested. Just as indicated in Baby Wise, after being put to bed at 9pm, our little one wakes up at about 6:30am singing and cooing and goes back to sleep within 30 minutes. At 7:45am, he wakes up again and greets us with a smile when we walk in the room. Our baby gained weight and height predictably throughout his first few months, moving into the 50th percentile weight/height at his last visit. My sister and several of our friends have used Baby Wise with similar results. Is Baby Wise for everyone? - Probably not. If you enjoy structure and organization and are accustomed to being on a regular schedule yourself, your parenting style will probably mesh nicely with Baby Wise. If you consider yourself a free spirit who enjoys responding to the unpredictability that life often brings, then you will probably find Baby Wise to be restrictive to your parenting style. In fact, we have friends who did not use Baby Wise and ended up with happy, pleasant children as well. Does Baby Wise CAUSE babies to be pleasant and happy? I don't know, but it did work for us and I can only imagine how difficult parenthood would be for us without the principles explained in the book. 
This is the BEST baby book I've read. I would highly recommend it. This book shows how your baby will naturally sleep through the night by following the simple routine of: baby eats, baby has awake time, and then baby sleeps. It's so simple. It's not any type of a strict routine. You read your baby's signals, but at the same time teach the baby to eat, play and sleep in blocks of time. Then your baby will naturally sleep through the night. It's that simple, and it has helped me soooo much. When I had my first son, I had not heard of this book. I thought I was doing the best thing by demand feeding, co-sleeping etc. Unfortunately, that resulted in my son not being able to sleep through the night until he was one year old, eating multiple times at night, and needing someone to lie down next to him so he could get to sleep. What in the world was I thinking!! He could have been sleeping through the night in his crib by 3 months old. Instead, I was totally sleep deprived having to wake up throughout the night to feed him, give him a pacifier, or by simply being awakened by his constant restless sleeping. I now have 4 month old TWINS, which both sleep through the night in their cribs. Life with twins (and now my first son is two) and using the BabyWise method is soooooo much easier than when I had my son and was using Attachment Parenting methods. Its amazing. I didn't read Babywise until the twins were about 8 weeks old. I was feeling stressed and had no structure for the babies. I was just trying to "get through the day." One of the babies would cry every 2 hours, and I kept thinking he must be hungry. Then I would feed him, but he wouldn't eat much and then he'd cry again 2 hours later. After reading the book, I learned exactly what the problem was: my son was tired, not hungry. He was waking up from his nap too early and needed to sleep longer. I don't know what I would have done without this book. Now when one of my babies cry, I know exactly what the problem is. And actually they rarely ever cry. As the book explains, just like you and me, when babies get a good night sleep they feel refreshed and happy the next day. My babies are rarely EVER grumpy or fussy. I've had so many people act amazed at how content and happy they are. I then just explain to them the simple routine of eat-play-sleep from BabyWise. Some people act like "the baby knows best," but they don't! They're just a baby. You as the parent need to help teach the baby how to sleep. If people claim their baby wasn't getting enough to eat, then they were not following the book. The book clearly teaches you if and when there is a problem. My babies are chunky, alert and happy. Now, when I read about parents demand feeding and co-sleeping, I just feel sorry for them because they're making life alot more difficult for themselves. Eventually they won't want their kids sleeping in bed with them anymore and then the little guys don't know how to go to sleep on their own. When my twins start yawning, I just lie them down in their cribs and they go to sleep. I don't have to "help" them get to sleep. And demand feeding....CRAZY. You're just teaching your baby to snack all day and night. Then the baby doesn't get a good sleep and so they wake up cranky and tired and want to sooth themselves by eating again. Its a bad cycle. This book really is amazing. There are also other books in the series that target specific baby ages, as they get older. I would also recommend Baby Whisperer by Hogg, but only as a supplement to BabyWise. Baby Whisperer is not complete about the specifics of the eat-play-sleep routine. Don't get mislead about some of the Ezzo bashing. Its ridiculous and has nothing to even do with the content of the book. I've noticed that alot of demand feeding parents don't like to be reminded that they or they're babies are not sleeping through the night 
To those who think this book recommends ignorning a hungry child just because he ate 2 hours ago rather than the prescribed 3, I suggest you read the book a little more carefully. The feeding schedule is just a guideline, and the book does emphasize (in several places) that when your child is hungry, food should never be denied, hunger cues should never be ignored. Parents: read the book, then make up your mind on whether or not this technique is one you want to adopt. If you haven't read the book, keep your opinions to yourself. No one cares to know what you learned after doing a google search on the author. If the information in the book makes sense to you, and your pediatrician doesn't disagree, does it really matter in what subject the author earned his master's degree? 
This book is about setting boundaries for your child at a young age. I read the book in one sitting because it was fascinating and the next night after following the advice, my son slept for 9 hours (he was 4 months old). He has consitently been a very well behaved, happy, and well adjusted child. A routine, established boundaries, and yes... even discipline gives your child confidence (mommy actually knows what's up!!). I've met moms who thought babywise was "terrible" and "cruel", but interstingly enough not a single one of them had actually read the book... and guess what?? The same babies that decided their own schedules turned into toddlers and children that ran the household. If you don't teach your kids the rules and boundaries, they will learn them the hard way; by testing you.... The idea that this book is about starving your child or corporal punishment is just plain ridiculous!! Don't fall victim to the media venom! 
Seems like an easy enough subject. But so many books like this are just fluffy ideas for employers to rah rah, and lie, to the employees. Said to say it's true. I've known a lot of people who have really strugged with the career thing. I knew a girl who went seven years without taking a vacation to impress her boss. She got laid off the eighth year. I read the transcript of an interview with this author (www.firstvoicebooks.com/yerks.html) and she just seemed to have something to say. She even mentioned that people need to be paid for their work, a tonic for all the b.s. of people who say working for free will get you good attention. If you work for free, your work is worth nothing. 
Begins with an ominous warning by ancient historian Herodotus. "If a man insisted always on being serious, and never allowed himself a bit of fun and relaxation, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it." The rest of the book is an attempt to prevent these dire things from happening especially in the workplace. The book is bubbly. Bubbly excitement prevails. But near the end, the author cautions us that, "excess is too much even when it comes to fun" And I'm sure a man as smart as Herodotus would also say that if you have fun all the time with no seriousness at all, that could be dangerous too 
If you're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun--FISH! is the one I'd recommend. In FUN Works, the author presents ELEVEN principles that are supposed to help us "understand the importance of the Fun/Work Fusion." With eleven principles, this book is all over the place, and somehow misses the mark. I fervently believe that work should be FUN, but I didn't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way 
I do not know where to start. I read Nora Roberts all the time and this is by far my favorite of her trilogies. There is a little of everything. Sorcery, vampires, witches, time travel, battles and of course romance. Do not even think about it just get the book and find a quiet place to settle down and get started 
Some of the negative reviews would have turned me off this book if I had read them first. I have enjoyed this book, the Vampire, Geall setting did not turn me off. Actually It was a nice change. I enjoy contempory, historical, mystical and I guess Vampire. Yeah Nora for having more of a read than in some of your latest books 
I've been a Nora Roberts fan for years...but originally was turned off by a review I'd read for this book. You see, while I can deal with sorcery, witches and the like as in the Key Trilogy and the Island Trilogy...I have a hard time with fantasy worlds. Tell me we're in Scotland, and I have an appropriate mental image...but, tell me we're in Geall...and, well, I'm really lost. Vampires...or should we say vampyres. I read "Interview with a Vampire" when it was originally published...years before other people seemed to discover Anne Rice. So, I'm okay with vampires, too. And the fantasy world thing...don't want to be a spoiler, here...but in this first book of the trilogy, not much time was spent in Geall. I loved this book. In fact, I read it pretty much in one sitting. I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews. Glenna, Hoyt, Larkin, Moira, Cian, King and Blair...what an army! I instantly liked them and think their characters were well conceived and presented. Okay...so, maybe the romance was a bit on the quick side...but, it is fiction, after all...and given the types of men we're talking about here (I was thinking McSteamy)...I think we can all believe in love at first sight! Only thing that could have made this book better, is if I'd known there was a glossary in the back...before I finished! I have the next two books in the series tucked away in a drawer...can't decide whether or not to continue on, now, or wait a while. Actually, I think what we have here is a 1,000 page novel...so maybe I'll end this review here...and go get "Dance of the Gods" and settle in for a long afternoon of reading...in a fantasy world! 
This book has been summarized often enough that I don't think it will be necessary for me to give yet another summary. I have to say that I am very surprised by so many negative to luke-warm reviews for this book. I loved it! I found the "Key" trilogy unreadable, but the first book in this series was simply fantastic! I think that the problem that people are having is that this book blends a couple of genres, notably urban fantasy/fantasy with romance. Therefore, this book is neither an urban fantasy nor a romance, but a story that contains elements of both. I loved Hoyt and Glenna as characters, but really other than the "bad" guys most of the people in this book are really well drawn characters with likable characteristics. The introduction to the world and the characters was well done without being simply an "intro" book. A story complete in itself, this book drew me in and was impossible to put down! I say that you should ignore the bad reviews, unless you are romance purist or a fantasy purist that expects all of the conventions of those genres to be adhered to strictly. If you like a great story with great characters, action, and romance then read this fantastic addition to Nora Roberts' already outstanding booklist 
This is book one of the Circle Trilogy Hoyt Mac Cionaoith is a wizard that has failed to kill Lilith, a vampire queen that has turned his twin brother Cian into one of her demons. The goddess, Morrigan appears to Hoyt, telling him this was only the beginning and that he will have to find the five others that will help him with his quest to destroy Lilith and her demons from taking over all the worlds. She sends him to 21st century New York where he is to find the witch, the warrior, the scholar, one that shape shifts, and the one that you lost. The team: Hoyt is reunited with his brother Cian. Moira, the scholoar and Larkin, the shape-shifter time-travel from Geall where Lilith's band has already terrorized their land. Glenna is the witch, who has dreamed of Hoyt. Last to join them, is Blair, who is a demon hunter. Along with trying to work together so that they may defeat the vampires before Samhaim, it is also Glenna and Hoyt's touching story of love. The tale concentrates on these two characters as they both deal in the magical aspects of protecting the team. The casting of their spells was done honorably, without ever misusing the craft. Ms. Robert's has penned a tale of myth, magic and love all into one. This paranormal romance will surely bewitch you. I look forward to the next book in the series, where I am sure we will learn more about the other characters of the circle. 
Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one. I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels. Morrigan's Cross disappointed me. Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist. I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood. King was a comic relief, but he got killed. That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it. I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy. Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself. 
I am a big fan of Nora Roberts. I love the ones that she writes with a touch of magick in them, and this time she delivers in a big way -- witches, vampires, shift-shaper, time travelers, and of course, romance. This is the first of a triology centering around Hoyt, a wizard, and his vampire brother Cian. They are brought together by Morrigan, the pagan goddess of war. She gives them a mission -- save the world from Lilith, a 2,000 year old vampire who just happens to be Cian's sire. She tells Hoyt that he must gather four more to complete the circle of heroes who will travel to Geall, another world where they will do battle with Lilith and her army of vampires. They have a very short time to train and prepare for this war which will take place on Samhain, the pagan name for the present day Halloween. Hoyt meets his true love, Glenna, in modern day New York City. She is a witch with tremendous power. Together they prove to be an indomitable foe of the vamps. Usually Roberts centers her stories around the romance, but this time, it is more about the situation that they are in. The first book is mostly about how the group comes together and how they prepare for the mission given them. I grew a little bored when they were training and such, and that is the only reason I gave this book a four instead of five stars. I would have liked a little more character development for each of them. I didn't seem to connect with Hoyt as much as I usually do with the heroes of a Roberts book. I really liked the description of Glenna's spells, and her belief system. She prefers the safety of a circle when casting her spells, and Roberts does a good job of describing her magick and the dangers of mis-using your powers. Being Wiccan and a practicing witch, I am appreciative of how Roberts is careful of how she presents the craft and the old religion. My daughter is reading the second one, and tells me that it is really good, too. Hey, how can you go wrong with a book by Nora Roberts? 
I just love Nora Roberts, but I have to say she has truly outdone herself with the latest The Circle Trilogy. They are hard to put down. Great reading 
Just not my cup of tea. Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
When I heard Nora had written another trilogy, I was excited. Normally I can't wait to finnish them. However, I have only managed to get about halfway through this book. I found it hard to from the past to the present, and vampires just aren't my thing I suppose. Knowing me, I'll leave this for a couple months, then try to read it again. Who knows, I might end up liking the book after all 
As a middle-aged gay man growing up in a California suburb, I felt isolated and alone during my formative years. Had I seen a book like this and learned that far from being alone I was part of a rich and wonderful cultural tradition I think it would have made a huge difference. Thanks to the authors of this book 
Lehane is a master of his genre and this offering is one of his best. The story moves with riptide speed, and each page brings new surprises and plot twists. Lehane is good because he goes the extra mile to spin for his readers a yarn that keeps them reading and doesn't insult their intelligence -- at least most of the time. Bubba, for example, is a caricature and totally unbelieveable but what the heck, Lehane couldn't resolve some of the plot situations without a guy like Bubba. A plot so rich and full could easily spin out of control but Lehane is a journeyman and keeps things focused. That's why I like him and intend to read all his books 
I really liked this book. Lehane has great character development. You feel like these people are real (Patrick, Angie, Bubba). Gotta love that Bubba!! More please Mr. Lehane 
Lehane has outdone himself on this one. Starting with a seemingly sad unconnnected event (the suicide of a client Kenzie only spoke to once, and then forgot to respond to her phone message), Kenzie begins a search for truth. It will lead him back from the depressive edge of insanity that resulted from the events of 'Gone,Baby,Gone' and once again into the arms of Angela Gennaro (hopefully for good). What makes these five Boston based mysteries, so amazing, isn't the tight plotting, but it is the detailed descriptions of what his characters do and think. There are very few throw-away characters, and almost all of them are represented as real people. The motivation, to present everyone as more than just a shell, is one of the hallmarks of Lehane's writing. This is a well structured, and even plausible story, that builds to a climax, just when it should, but with Lehane, the ending always takes you back a step, reminding you that there are no fairytale endings. Your never sure if anyone will live, happily or be the same after it's over. 
When a former client of Patrick Kenzie kills herself mere months after he warned off her stalker, Kenzie, out of a profound sense of guilt, investigates. After reconciling with his former partner and lover, Angie Gennaro, the two stumble upon a the truth: that the client was systematically stripped of everything in her life until she committed suicide. The responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed, and has now set his sights on Kenzie and Gennaro. After the ambiguous villains of "Gone Baby Gone", Dennis Lehane returns to a more traditional type of villain for his fifth Kenzie/Gennaro book, "Prayers for Rain." While nowhere the monstrous serial killer Lehane created in "Darkness, Take My Hand" (the second book in the series), the villain of "Prayers for Rain" is sinister, smug, brilliant, and sadistic, inflicting pain and death because he can. Kenzie and Gennaro, in turn, want to stop him out of a sense of justice and vengeance. The tension mounts as the detectives must struggle to protect their own loved ones and safety while finding a the key to bringing down an invisible and brilliant killer. As with the rest of this series, Lehane explores the basic theme of power: who has it, why they want it, what they do to get it, and what they do when they have it. At the beginning of each novel, the most powerful character is the villain. They exercise their power violently, harming people because they can, and because their victims cannot fight back. It falls to Kenzie and Gennaro to exact revenge, which is usually pretty gratifying, if problematic, since our society generally frowns on revenge. Nonetheless, sometimes justice is not pretty, and it's understood that Kenzie and Gennaro are in the best position to fulfill that justice. While "Prayers for Rain"is the last Kenzie/Gennaro book for the time being, Lehane has not written a "last" book in a series. It would be easy for him to pick up this series if he so chose. I hope he does, as I have enjoyed Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro's company for the past couple of years. "Prayers for Rain" embodies much of what is great about this series and Lehane as a writer. It's sharp, taut, intense, funny, and gripping. 
Lehane strikes gold once again with this kenzie/gennaro adventure. although, the reader must have realized by now that his titles don't really have anything to do with the plot (except, gone, baby, gone, mystic river and shutter island), one can't deny the fact that Lehane is one of the very best there is 
I got hooked on Lehane after Mystic River, and his thriller Shutter Island was absolutely gripping and completely mind-twisting. I had to stay up late one night to finish that, and I couldn't sleep afterwards, so I had to read a Dave Barry book to take my mind off it! I should have learned my lesson, because as soon as I got into Prayers for Rain, I couldn't get the creepiness and mystery out of my head, and I once again had to stay up late to finish the entire book. I'm a snob who usually avoids genre fiction, and I have a sneaking suspicion this might be found in the mystery/crime genre section, but Lehane is really a league above the other mytery writers I have read. Lehane is a masterful storyteller and has a rock solid plot here. He's very talented with the psychological aspects of crime (very much so in Shutter Island...I fear my review is becoming a big ad for that book!), and I wished he had further developed some of the psychological aspects in this book. The lesson I've learned about Lehane is that he is such a good and creepy storyteller than I'm no longer reading any of his books in bed late at night. They are only to be digested when I am lying on the beach. If you enjoy thrillers, definitely get this book, and be prepared to be blown away by a well-crafted plot 
This was by far the best Genero/Kenzie novel of the series. I loved this book. Everything about it. In this one, you really got to see the emotional side of Bubba. Made him more likeable. The storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down. I was happy to see Angie and Patrick back together. The ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book. I'm scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why Lehane hasn't published another. It's been 5 years. I will be watching for it 
The only thing I can say about Dennis Lehane is: "When's the next one going to print?" For myself, I thought 'Prayers' dialogue was a bit snappier, more colorful, than the others but that's me. One of the many things I enjoy about Lehane's writing is that he puts as much effort into the last ten pages as he did the first ten. In detective and mystery stories, that's rare indeed 
Love this cookbook!! I already put post-its in all of the recipies I want to try...which is almost half the book! =) I just made the Carbanara and it was AMAZING!!! I even have leftovers so I can have lunch tomorrow! And it really only took me around 30 minutes to cook...I was skeptical, but I did it!!! And trust me, I DO NOT COOK! This is all pretty new to me and something sparked in me to start cooking, Rachel Ray was recommended and now I love her!! I think I'll be purchasing all her books because I bet they are all just as wonderful!! I highly recommend this book to everybody and anybody!! I love the layout too...I don't have to look for sides because they are already there 
This is a cookbook everyone should own. My son who is normally picking loved the recipes in the book. Very easy to follow and have dinner ready in 30 minutes 
Great book and recipies. However, I need more simple recipes. I should have purchased 30 Minute Meals-1. 
I love her shows and so I got this book. I really love the recipes and they really are as easy to make as she says. The only think I don't like is that a lot of her ingredients are expensive. I just can't afford all the gourmet ingredients her recipes call for. That really disappoints me because I just can't make a number of her recipes. But still a good buy 
So far this book is as good as the first one. I love Rachel Ray and her receipes. I am retired and have recently takes a part time job again and find these tips she offers to be super easy and very healthy 
Just love this girl and her cooking and the book just adds to her recipes 
This cookbook is just like her TV program (on the Food Network -- easy to understand and the food is very yummy!) Or as Rachael would say: "Yummo! 
My brother bought this cookbook for me 2-3 years ago for Christmas and I have yet to crack it open. You can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free (but why would you???) after seeing some of her more recent episodes, I am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside. Her recipes scare me and I wouldn't feed half of what she makes to my dog. Don't waste the money. If you think you wanna try her recipes, print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire. 
I got this book as a gift and at first I was a little skeptical (she is sometimes a little too creative with the ingredients on her show for my liking). When I finally got around to looking through the recipes, I found myself bookmarking A LOT more recipes than I ever thought I would. There are fun recipes like fresh mozarella bites (make sure to add a pinch of salt). Then there are some classic recipes like sloppy joes, however, she adds vinegar to the recipe, which I had never heard of and after trying the recipe would never add again (I would also add a little less brown sugar than she calls for). And the cream cheese mashed potatos are delicious. All-in-all I would buy this book for myself if I hadn't received it as a gift 
I love this cookbook. I try a new recipe just about every other night, and so far I have found only one dud. It is fresh,has lots of taste, and delicious. I also love that the book is set up as meals, so she provides the main course recipe and also recipes for sides and dessert to go with the main course. There is a "make your own takeout" section, a "healthy eating" section, a "fancy meals" section, and a section of foods that kids will eat. There may be other sections too that I dont remember. The food is generally OK for you, but I modify a bit by using low sodium broth and skimp on some items she suggests to add to the dish. Also, I am on a budget, and ingredients required are very simple... nothing too fancy or exotic/expensive! The best cookbook I ever bought! ...but beware, it takes more than 30 minutes. 
It has some over the top moments but all in all a new mother will be able to relate to a lot of it 
I thought this book was well worth the read. I Passed it on to my other mommie friends (who drink) and they thought is was good also. There were plenty of parts that I could say "Yes! that's me" and other parts that were laugh out loud funny and shed a tear sad. This would be a good book club book...for mommies 
This is hands-down the BEST "mommy" book I have read. Forget all the parenting magazines, forget all the girlfriend guides...anyone who has become a mommy and wonders where the wild girl she was before went MUST read this book. I listened to the audiobook and it had me in stitches. Thank you Brett Paesel for your brutal, raw, and much needed honesty 
This is the funniest, best book I've ever read about the thoughts and emotions of new mothers. Brett Paesel has had the courage to publish thoughts that I don't even admit I have. Even my husband, who endured my reading it aloud to him, enjoyed it and totally relates to the scenarios Brett paints about her own husband. I laughed and I cried. And I recommended it to all the young women inside and outside my family who have babies 
Any adult can relate to the core story: How does one resolve a decision your heart knows is right, but which threatens the rest of your being? Here, Brett knows having a husband, child, and family was the right choice, but she'd like a second opinion. What follows is a story of a woman searching for the answer she knows it out there. The answer that is, "yes. Yes. Yes!" I also recommend the audio book version as read by the author 
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It literally made me laugh out loud several times. In fact, I lost track of how many times. My husband kept asking me what was funny. This is a memoir where parts feel a bit exaggerated, but are hilarious nonetheless. The supposed main subject: Brett (the author's) coming to grips with motherhood, struggling to hold onto her pre-baby self, and remaining her own woman with ideas and thoughts independent of motherhood. Yet a lot of it is about the bizarreness of raising a child in Hollywood: preschool auctions where face lifts and breast jobs are up for grabs, getting "points" to get into competitive magnet schools, and there is a priceless scene where she and her husband get stoned out of boredom at her in-laws' and end up raiding their children's Christmas stockings. This is motherhood at its irreverent best. 
I don't have children myself, but I have several girlfriends with children. The sweet relief I feel is knowing that the madness my friends experienced (and I viewed with worry and concern) is common and to be expected and, who knew, freakin' hilarious. I finished the book in one day. I could NOT put it down. I lauged at every turn of the page. I can't wait to read it again. 
Truly affecting. It's a book that crosses genres as I'm not a parent, but I was consistently moved and often laughed out loud. I don't often find a book that is actually "difficult to put down", but Paesel keeps your attention with her insight and delicious wit. It's excellent 
In a field littered with shoddily written confessional memoirs, Mommies Who Drink stands out as an excellent book across the boards. It goes without saying that it's funny and topical, but there's more to it than that. I finished the book in one sitting. A couple days later I picked it up and started again, paying close attention to the writing. In addition to her deadpan hilarity and keen eye, Paesel brings tremedous skill to the page. There's an economy of language and precision in the composition that strengthens the humor and pace, but also rivets the reader's attention when she moves seamlessly from comic narrative to poignant observation. In fact, the realizations offered flow organically from the comedy; the one depends on the other. I was thankful to discover that the book is completely free of cynicism and hipster attitude. It is, instead, an open and big hearted book that is filled with sentiment, but not at all sentimental. This funny, tender, expertly written memoir stands up to, and invites, repeat readings. A sure sign of quality writing. 
Loved this book. Not only the wry observations of what happened but the touching, poignant love of her children. Loved the quip about why do people think that not talking a lot when you're in small town is a virtue. Zipped through it and laughed out loud 
If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!! The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale. The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt. A great read if you're looking for nightmares. 
I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst. There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other. Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other. Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s. They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex. The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre. All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention. No such luck. I used to love reading SB novels. I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading. No more. In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann. Granted, I never read SB for the suspense. I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story. If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter. They do suspense so much better 
I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated 
Excellent storey. Suzanne Brockmann stays true to the contiuation of the navy seals. Haven't read a book yet by her I haven't enjoyed 
Ms. Brockmann is absolutely one of my top 3 authors. This book delivers another great combination of story lines and characters. The current and former members of Seal Team 16 are revisited and in fact pitted against each other. This book focuses on Mark Jenkins, who has only been peripherally involved in some of the other books in this series. Also, there is a new installment on the relationship between Sophia Ghafari and Lawrence Decker who were the focus of a previous book. 
the pace was a little slow to beginn but picked up.i couldn't put the book down once it picked up and read it in 1 day.seems everybody got wet at some point and time and the banter was out loud funny and shocking.but when will we stop the short stories and get another book on Sam and Alyssa thats what I hungery for.To pass the time this will do, pull out the past books on troubleshooters inc to keep up with whos whos 
Suzanne Brockmann Never disappoints. Her story lines are always original and her romance always steamy. Brockmann has built a family of characters her readers have learned to care about. It just keeps bringing me back again and again to find out whose book will be next. 
This was a great book. It has page turning suspense and some comedy. This is one of the best books I've read in a while. I really enjoyed Lindsey "Linds" and Mark "Jenks" but Izzy definitely added fun to the book 
Read this book you'll know the reasons why people succeeded in the 20th, 19th, 18th century, and will keep on doing so in the 21st century: Their people skills, not technology 
Although the title does not quite do the book justice, this book more relevant for today's business world than any in the past five years. "Networking" has taken on a negative connotation in the recent past, but Ferrazzi shows how sincerity is the most important aspect of bringing people into your own network. 
I do a lot of networking around town. It is often that I will meet people and share coffee with someone and then I will not continue to keep in touch with them. In the book Never Eat Alone Keith Ferrazzi writes about how to keep in touch with the people you know. He has creative ideas about working your circles, having productive social gatherings, networking properly and always seek out to meet someone new 
I thoroughly enjoyed listening to these CD's. They are full of good information and practical suggestions. My husband and I both enjoyed them and are now hosting our own dinner parties 
Overall this was a really good book. Like any business book, you need to apply what you read, rather than just read it for the advice to work, and everything in this book will work. The only reason for this not receiving 5 stars was the name dropping began to get a little old, at least for me. I understand that it drives the point home about what someone who came from humble beginnings can accomplish through networking, but not everyone wants to hear every famous person the author is friends with. And Ariana Huffington is the last person I would be bragging I had over for dinner 
I'll be honest, even though I chose this book myself I was very skeptical when I first approached it - there is something in the title that challenged my status quo. I am introvert and our society tends to value extraverted nature; I was afraid that this book would repeat this extraversion mantra all over again, and I couldn't have been more wrong, what I found was volumes of invaluable advice! Keith Ferrazzi is most definitely an extrovert of the most extreme kind, but his philosophy is invaluable to both camps - he argues for building relationships, not contacts. It is not a quid pro quo process, nor a one way street, it's going out of your way to expand your own horizons and to appreciate other people - relationships are about what you give. Charm, as he points out, is simply being yourself. You need to have a dream, you need to be audacious at times, you need to add value to everything you do, you do need to position yourself and have a unique point of view. In the end, what else could we wish for if not having a job we love with people who know us for who we really are - if that is what networking is all about, then count me in! Not even two weeks after I've read this book, I found myself applying these principles in my own life, and guess what, it works! It's a great book, I think everyone will take a different lesson from it, and I would give it six stars if I could. 
Out of work? Stuck in a job you do not like? Stuck in a life you do not like? Then run out and get Keith Ferrazzi's superb "Never Eat Alone." Ferrazzi provides practical "how tos" on expanding one's thinking and, subsequently, one's life, through networking. I have spent countless hours working with professionals and executives in-transition. Many know how to write a resume, call search firms, and prepare for interviews but few know how to network. And networking is THE KEY to finding a fulfilling job and life. With Ferrazzi's book, I now have a resource to recommend. "Never Eat Alone" is organized into four sections: The Mind Set; The Skill Set; Turning Connections into Compatriots; and Trading Up and Giving Back. Each section is packed with good, proven, common sense advice. People who have succeeded in their careers and life will, if they read this book, endorse what Ferrazzi recommends. It is at the core of success in life. Networking is not a one-shot endeavor, something you do when you are need. Rather it is a way of life, and is based on doing something for others WITHOUT the expectation of getting something in return. Ferrazzi shows us how going the extra mile for others leads to unexpected rewards. 
Mr. Ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career: he is an Ivy-league grad. While I found some of his insights to be helpful, he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings. While he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his working-class roots, Mr. Ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page, writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club. Caddying at a country club is not a degrading, confidence-busting job for a kid, working as a cashier at CVS is. How does the CVS kid network his way out? In one point in the book, Mr. Ferrazzi creates a lot of build up about an event he attended and how much anxiety he felt. The big denouement was that he had a connection through Yale. This is not compelling. I was expecting him to have had to actually overcome something. There are some good insights in the book, but few that I hadn't heard before. I'm not sure that this book has shed any light on anything aside from the advantages of belonging to ivy-league networks 
I feel obliged to share my review of this book. I got hold of it by chance and what luck! Like a lot of people I know the value of building relationships, because most of the best business I've had have been from by circle of contacts. However, I cringe at the concept of "networking" and fail miserably at trying to leverage my network. This book however got me to understand the DIFFERENCE between networking and relationship building. I won't spoil it for you, but once you read the book and understand the difference you will immediately change you view of building relationships that unimaginably augment your financial, professional, social and philantropic efforts. Do yourself a favour and buy this book! 
Book #24 in the In Death Series. In this book we have the death of Dr. Icove. Eve suspects a professional due to the efficient way he was killed. Security disks show his last appointment of the day a beautiful woman entering and leaving his office. As Eve thinks his record is too clean she suspect his son another Dr., knows more than he is saying... But then he ends up dead in the same precise manner. This is a tale of Doctors playing God. Eve butts heads with Mira in this book and it is a little annoying. But other than that this book is excellent and the plot so different 
This has to be the best Eve Dallas book to date!!!! Ms. Robb not only gets 5 stars for creativity, but for scientific accuracy. What could have been a completely far fetched story was made chillingly believable by Ms. Robb's skill. I also appreciated her ability to explain complex medical and scientific information in a way that was easy to understand. A must read 
Good Eve Dallas vehicle with added futuristic sci-fi elements. Characters remain strong and forceful yet vulnerable and "human" 
While Eve Dallas and her partner Peabody are interviewing a witness at the Wilfred B. Icove Center for Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery, the body of Dr. Wilfred B. Icove, Sr. is discovered. Due to the way Icove was murdered, Eve suspects a professional hit by the last person to come in contact with Dr. Icove, a mysterious young woman. As Eve investigates, she begins to suspect that there is something off about Dr. Icove's practice, and when his son is found murdered in the same manner as the father, Eve delves deeper into the doctors' pasts. What she discovers not only sickens but shocks Eve, who, with the help of her husband, Roarke, intends to put a stop to a secretive illegal, immoral, and unethical scientific experiment that involves cloning. J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts has written an engaging thriller here about a subject that is presently being debated among the scientific community and which, due to DNA advancements, may very well come to pass. Eve's edgy manner of dealing with people, balanced by Roarke's understanding and love and Peabody's perky demeanor, continue to bring freshness to a well-grounded series. 
J.D. Robb's futuristic series starring Eve Dallas, edgy investigator, gets better with each outing. This one brings back all my favorite characters - foremost Peabody - with a riveting mystery involving DNA and cloning and all things related that linger on the horizon. I absorbed every page and, as always, eagerly await the next one 
Origin in Death J. D. Robb/Nora Roberts G.P. Putnam's Sons Penguin Group (USA) Inc. 375 Hudson Street, New York, NY, 10014, USA ISBN: 039915289X, $24.95, 339 pp, 2005 In July 1995 J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, published her first "in death" book, Naked in Death. Since then she has written twenty-two novels and two novellas in this continuing series about Lieutenant Eve Dallas, a futuristic NYPD homicide detective; Roarke, her gorgeous, wealthy husband, and Eve's crime-fighting team. These novels are quintessential police procedural mysteries, with a twist of humor, pyschodrama, sex and sensitivity. Prior to reading this entire series, I had a fear of reading books about the terrible things people do to each other, how we use our wonderful imagination to create pain and terror. I actually used this series to confront my fears and to get past them, for within this series you will find every possible, imaginable form of evil. Each novel certainly can stand alone; however, I read the series in chronological order, which I highly recommend for maximum enjoyment. You will quickly grow to know and love all her characters-Peabody, her partner; McNab, Peabody's tall, skinny loveman; Mavis, her radically-clad, extroverted, singer friend; Summerset, Roarke's majordomo and thorn in Eve's side-to name a few. After reading this series, I can now read anything gruesome or frightening-stalking, dismemberment, blood everywhere, revenge, torture, whatever-and find it prosaic compared to these novels. Now, back to Origin In Death. It is year 2059 in New York City and someone has murdered reconstructive and cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Wilfred Icove. The victim was found in his office with one clean stab wound to his heart and no evidence of a struggle. The case turns bizarre when Wilfred's son dies in the same manner. In both cases they seem to have trusted their killer. Eve's instincts tell her that the father and son had a hidden dark secret and that the motive for the murders . . . had its origin in death. J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts's writing is consistently excellent. She is a consummate artist in any genre-romance, mystery, thrillers, fantasy, science fiction-you name it, she can write it. Since her first book, Irish Thoroughbred, published in 1981, she has written over 300 novels. You won't be disappointed. Reviewer: Kaye Trout - March 16, 2006 - Copyright 
I have read and been a fan of J.D. Robb since I first opened one of her books. Several I have "read" as audiobooks and this one was as geat an experience as the others. The reading of the book was well done and the "voices" excellent. Really adds to your listening enjoyment. One of my favorite ways to take a car trip now is with a Robb audiobook. 
As always, J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts gives a solid performance in Origin in Death. The only negative thoughts I have on the book are that many of the events are clearly over the top with multiple clones and underground explosions. Usually the In Death books reflect the gritty reality of 2059. Origin in Death was much more Star Trek than Star Wars (the early years). Otherwise, a solid writing effort from Roberts 
Lt. Eve Dallas is catching killers once again in this installment of the In Death series. The story is great, with two identical murders of father and son body sculpters. It's up to Lt. Dallas - along with her amusing cop sidekicks and, of course, her hot husband, Roark, to find out whodunit. The book starts off great, but toward the end, begins to drag with so many details about cloning, illegal experiements and politics. The ending is a bit over-the-top (not giving away any details, kids) and so unrealistic that it took me a while to get through it - an unusual occurance for me. Still, this is a well-written read and certainly worth a turn of page 
Most serious fans can roll off satistics about their favorite player but few realize that the numbers they cite have little to do with wins and losses. Baseball is a team sport that captures the American Spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend. Even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game. Likewise, a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the win/loss talley. In Moneyball, Michael Lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game. Like real life, this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the Sports Page. Every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics. There is the so-so pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game, or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track. Lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the LA Angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and hard-nosed business managers can profit from and enjoy. 
This is a perfect example of edutainment at its best. Terrfic fun while simultaneously teaching you a great deal about the key factors that determine a teams win rate. Aside from the style and the analysis this book also does something even more valuable: It highlights a management approach that is truly based on merit, as opposed to how "pretty" an athelete is or how much charisma they have. For people who believe that the USA is as close as any country to being a meritocracy - this book is a shining example of just that. I am truly astonished and dismayed by the negative reviews I have read. I can't wait for Lewis to write his next book. 
Money Ball was a great book. It shows that you don't need money to win in baseball(take that Yankees ;-P) Michael Lewis reavels that the team with the 2nd lowest payroll, the Oakland Athletics, can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team. Lewis also tells the story of Billy Beane the GM of the Athletics. Billy's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the MLB. He exerts his attitude as a force over the so-called "experts" when a desicion must be made. Billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of. He shows that there are many aspects of the game that we don't know. All in all, this was an excellant book. My only complaint was that there was a lot of swearing.--- Jesse Hartman 
If you are a fan, this is a great read. If you are not a fan, but just interested in the game, it is still a great read. What I find most amusing are the baseball "experts" who poo-poo Billy Bean's approach to fielding and running a baseball team. "The proof of the pudding is in the eatin'" and the cognocenti appear to dislike the taste. The Oakland A's have been one of the stellar teams, yet, it appears that success is not what is important. What is important is success based on the recipe that the "experts" write 
How is it that the Oakland A's have won the AL West in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll? That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball. One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas. It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news. The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up. Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others. And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning. When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point. 
I'm not a baseball fan. Hockey is the game of my heart. Baseball? No way. But, I loved this book. The only other baseball book that I've ever read that comes close to this high-water mark is Ball Four by Jim Bouton. Funny and interesting in its own right. A real joy to read. Great characters and insight to management. A wonderful story about tearing down a culture from the inside. And who can argue with the Oakland A's success? Here it is September 2006 and they're once again leading their division, 5 games up on the Angels ... and this is the inside track on how they've done it with one of the worst payrolls in baseball. 
When I was growing up I devoured any book written about baseball. As I've gotten older, my passion for the game has waned. Though still a fan, I'd not read a baseball book in several years until I finally got around to reading this one. Reading Moneyball four years after the events occured sheds new light on things. The first portion of the book focuses on the personality and playing history of general manager Billy Beane and then has an inside look at the 2002 amateur draft, where many of Beane's philosophies are put into action. Beane is ecstatic when Scott Kazmir and Prince Fielder are selected by other teams thus allowing him to get the player he covets, Nick Swisher. Swisher has panned out nicely for the A's. Jeremy Brown, the other draftee Lewis focuses on, has not had the success anticipated (he had his first big league at bat just last night). The rest of the book has some interesting moments as well. There is a lengthy discussion of sabrmetrics and the role Bill James and others have played in shaping the A's philosophy. Also, a couple of really interesting profiles of Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford which shed some light on the strange paths some people take on their way to major league baseball. Lewis focuses a lot of attention on Paul DePodesta, the assistant GM for the A's. In fact, without saying so directly, I get the impression that Lewis feels he's at least equally responsible for the A's successes. DePodesta has since gone on to an unsuccessful sting with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Reading the book a few years after the fact gives some perspective on some of the mistakes that Beane and the A's have made with some player decisions, but despite those mistakes, the bottom line is that the franchise has continued to excel despite being dramatically outspent and despite the fact that the rest of baseball has been "clued in" to the A's thinking. As an aside...I find it interesting that all of the attention has been paid to Beane and the A's. This is well deserved, for sure, but lost in all of this is the fact that the Minnesota Twins have been equally frugal and nearly equally successful. How have THEY done it? It might make for an interesting book itself. Any true baseball fan, even a somewhat lapsed baseball fan such as myself, should do him/herself a favor and pick up this book. It may even rekindle some interest in the game we grew up loving.. 
Field of Stats Although the steroid scandal may have eventually accomplished the same thing, "Moneyball" destroys any persistent romance surrounding professional baseball. It's an antidote to all those paeans glorifying the love of the game: "The Natural," "Field of Dreams," even the raunchy lens of "Bull Durham." Players don't rise and fall due to the nobility of their character, the sheer beauty of their swing, the sage advice of a wizened baseball scout, or even their batting average, per se. What Moneyball does is show how the Oakland A's, and a few emulators, dismissed all this lore and culture in favor of multiple regressions and other advanced statistical tools. It's a fascinating book that could have been a dry one--full of detailed statistics and equations--except that Lewis cleverly balances the mathematical perspective with the same character studies that have graced sports biographies for years. The book centers around former big league prospect Billy Beane, a man with great athletic ability who didn't make it in the bigs, partly because of his perfectionism and resulting temper. Years later, Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with stingy owners who'd rather save some bucks than buy a pennant (see "Yankees, The"). Faced with a shoestring budget, and enamored with the new baseball analysis cultivated by Bill James in his "Baseball Digest" system, Beane and his advisors invest in players as if they're brokers on Wall Street. James and other highly-educated baseball fanatics (often from Harvard, often lawyers or scientists with a mathematical bent) discover that the old wisdom wasn't all that smart: Their analyses yield cold, objective facts, and suddenly, as in the old "Firesign Theater" skit, "Everything You Know Is Wrong." It's not batting average and RBIs that are most important, it's on-base and slugging percentage that predict the one thing, the only outcome that matters--who wins. Throw out fielding statistics--these are too dependent on luck and the kind of pitches served up. Furthermore, invest in bargains: Overlooked players who get to first through walks rather than singles (the phrase, "a walk is good as a hit," was never so true as it is here), guys who aren't great all-around players but who fill complete missing elements in your roster (sort of like diversifying your portfolio, Beane and others take their cue from a market mechanism known as "derivatives"), and those who otherwise don't fit into other GMs' and scouts atheoretical notion of what makes a great player. The results are convincing. With one of the least expensive teams in baseball, the A's repeatedly make the playoffs. Beane acquires college players and castoffs from other teams like a man who collects trashy art, and XXX shows how his "I must be insane to offer you these bargains" style of purchasing ball players pays off, mostly through chapters devoted to one particular exemplar of Beane's philosophy. There are a few problems with the book, as there are a few problems with the stats-driven approach to building your team. The most egregious of these is Lewis' concentration on the successes predicted by statistics. For a book driven by science, Lewis ignores the other 3 cells of the implicit 2x2 table of success/failure by "uses Beane method"/"doesn't use method." The most significant is the failure/Beane method cell; Lewis just doesn't write about those players who didn't pan out as mathematically predicted. The only examination of failure is Beane's rather clinical excuse for never advancing very far in the playoffs--in a short series (I.e., when N is small), luck (i.e., the statistical error) tends to become more powerful and empirical "truths" suffer as a result. The fans suffer too, but their enjoyment of the game is always secondary to winning. Therefore, Athletics almost never steal bases (the percentages dictate no), and managerial and player judgment is minimized in favor of the all mighty victory. You have to admit it works, but when Beane shrugs off the post-season failure question almost with a "that's not my job," you have to wonder whether "Moneyball" is enough. Maybe it's just the best oine can do on a budget. (On the other hand, XXX Lewis to mention--even in his most recently written epilogue--that Beane's right hand man Paul DePodesta was fired after 2 seasons with the well-financed Dodgers.(A 71-91, 4th place finish in 2005 didn't help DePodesta.) Along with this bias towards success stories, XXX reveals a few bad writing habits. He'll sometimes describe something with sentences repeatedly beginning with the word "that." As in: "That the book doesn't look enough at failures. That the book was a best seller. That the book was reportedly misunderstood by many when published." Lewis also lapses into a high-falutin' prose style, somewhat emulating "King James"--Bill James of the pioneering Baseball Digest school of analysis. Still, "Moneyball" deserves its reputation and its sales. Beane's number-crunching, myth-busting approach isn't always pretty, but it makes sense and meets the bottom line of both winning and preserving capital. An excellent and accessible book that has it both ways, an argument for using "cold" higher math in sports, and a spirited study of the ballplayers who add value to the original purchase, and the GMs who know what it takes to buy low and sell high. 
Lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach ,used by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of ,primarily, on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers. This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League division,but no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.First,James's system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1 to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over,say,100 for a regular,everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season.The second problem is that the James system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays,especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs.Another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base.These walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits .250 but has a .375 OBP. James's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors 
This book was my introduction to sabermetrics, and proved to be quite a thrilling introduction. The application of truly smart statistical work the game of baseball in Billy Beane and the Oakland A's had me hooked from page one. Great material. It did seem to drag on a little, however. The first half of the book was thrilling. The end started to feel like more of the same old same old. But it's still worth finishing 
I have read all of the books in this series of Precious and her adventures in the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency. The first book was not what I expected at all. I am an avid detective and mystery novel reader. I found the first book in the series was slow at first with lots of background on Botswana, but after I finished the book I found that I truly enjoyed it. I gave it to my 80 year old mother and she too liked the book very much! She still asks me if there is anew one in the series; that is a good sign. I have read each novel, in order, although that is not necessary as they each stand alone. I have come to love Precious and her family and employee. The books are well written, interesting and really they are more about life in a country I have never visited and a life I know nothing about. I enjoy looking into Precious' life. Many thanks to the Scottish professor and his series of No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency 
I really enjoy the authors insights into the minds of the characters. The whole series is delightful and easy reading. I hope there is another book in the works 
The No. 1 Ladies's Detective Agency are always uplifting books in their praise of the simple life lived by its characters in Botswana. In thisnovel, again there are a couple of mysteries that are cleverly presented and solved with the focus on the human beings behind the stories and their feelings. The cases are what you would expect in real life as items that would need solving, but the presentation is what makes this series of books a joy to read. 
If you have never read one of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency books, I highly encourage you to read them in order before you get to this one. They are all outstanding, and introduce a variety of interesting characters who are all well known by the time this book starts. This book starts with a new character, Aunty Emang, the African version of Dear Abby. Precious Ramotswe takes an instant dislike to Aunty Emang due to the curt advice she dishes out. A variety of interesting side stories develop, but you know Aunty Emang will come back before the end of the book. And it is a humdinger of a conclusion. Enjoy it with a cup of bush tea. I don't know why Mr McCall-Smith cannot bring the same charm he draws out of Africa to his other series... but anyway, you gotta cherish the #1 Ladies Detective Agency and hopefully we will get many more books in the series 
For years I was mystified by the popularity of "Seinfeld," the comedy about nothing. Nothing of any substance ever happened, and the protagonists were a bunch of shallow jerks. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series adopts the "Seinfeld" motif, but here we have a "Seinfeld" of a superior sort. Nothing much happens in the stories, but the protagonists are a group of admirable characters. Seinfeld Co. worked through mundane situations with the "hurrah for me, the heck with you" attitude that scars so much of postmodern secular society. In contrast Mma Ramotswe and her cadre of of friends confront the mundane with humble dignity and depth of character. If you, the reader, can come away from the stories without feeling a deep affection and respect for Mma Ramotswe's circle of friends, you are hard-hearted indeed. The success of the series can be attributed to the effectiveness with which Alexander McCall Smith mines the same comedic vein so well done in the Rumpole stories--large repertorie cast, engaging (but flawed) protagonists, dead-on observations of the human condition, and all leavened with good humor and good will. In this latest installment, Mma Ramotswe again confronts situations which are at once slap-your-knee funny, scratch-your-head thought provoking, and dab-your-eye compelling, and she handles them with skill and savy. Smith even works in a send-up of Sherlock Holmes' deductive methods, as Mma Ramotswe attempts to apply them with mixed results. 
The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series are each a jewel in their own right and this most recent addition is no different. What lies within the pages of this book is the opportunity to be transported to the main character's simple, wisdom, and curiosity filled life in Botswana. Be ready to be transported on a great mini vacation when you read this book 
One of the best things about Alexander McCall Smith's entertaining No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is that these aren't really traditional detective stories at all. One must read between the lines to see that the amusing tales delve far deeper than solving simple mysteries and crimes. Each book provides an enchanting glimpse into the life and times of Botswana and the series really serves as a clever study of human nature. The loveable and heavyset chief detective Mma Ramotswe is clearly large and in charge, as her unique agency helps its clients and the stories' readers themselves discover many "things they already know." This charming series is excellent light reading and especially great for planes. Take the whole series with you to make a transatlantic flight go by in the blink of an eye! 
Mulholland's text is a very readable and approachable primer about using scripture for spiritual formation. One of the things I especially appreciated was his definition of spiritual formation that formed the foundation for his text. He refutes those who want to use scripture or any 'technique' to become more spiritual for their own sakes. Mulholland points the reader to a focus outside of themselves. He maintains that spiritual transformation must be for the sake of others and not ourselves 
I came to this book with the advantage of having sat under Dr. Mulholland in 4-5 courses including 2 on Biblical exegesis. The title of this book "Shaped by the Word", is 100% representative of his view of scripture. Mulholland very effectively teaches us that we should approach the scriptures with our hearts and our minds full expecting to be shaped by the work of God through His Word. Mulholland effectively communicates to us that when we always lead our study of scripture with reason our hearts will not be formed as God intends 
Mulholland's insistance that we are capable of letting go of what we know in order to freshly approace the scriptures with the intent of allowing ourselves to be shaped by God's Word is the premise of this excellent book. I lend it to friends, but make certain I retrieve it. The author describes the path he has personally trod in his attempt to realize his full God given potential. Examples illustrate his struggle to distinguish the critical difference between the accustomed reading of scripture for information, and the life changing willingness to read for personal spiritual formation. I am grateful for having discovered this fine author, and recommend this book to anyone interested in signposts to guide their spiritual journey 
Bought it because the author had compiled the book on Buffett's annual reports. Got really bored with this book however. It is written too acadamic style and mostly a reiteration of Graham/Buffet. You will be much happy if you read Intelligent Investor Buffets Essay book. This book is just an attempt to make money by invoking the names of investment masters in its title. I got my lesson - Only buy books written by the investment gurus who write it from their hands-on experience 
I believe that this book might be interesting for someone who is unfamiliar with value investing, but I must warn the more experienced reader that not much of new ideas are to found in this book. What surprises me most of all is that the author devotes the first half of his book to convincing people that marekts are inefficient. But what guy believing in efficient markets would ever consider buying a book on investing in the first place ? Right: anyone interested in this book can skip the first half. The second half is rather superficial and brings nothing new on the table for people familiar with value investing. My advice: avoid this book and buy instead 'The essays of Warren Buffet' of the same author. The latter is really a must-read for anyone serious about investing 
I am an 18 year old high school student who read this book for my economics class. I have recently opened an online investing account and have been working hard to learn all I can about the market and how to excel in it. I really feel that this was a great book for me since it covered everything about investing. If you are just getting into the market like me, I definitely suggest that you read this wonderful book since it really does give you that extra knowledge about the stock market that others dream to have. If you already know a ton about the market and investing, all I can tell you is that there must be something in this book that you will learn. Basically, here's my overall view. Read the book if you want to be different from all the other investors who think they know everything there is to know about the market. I also believe that this is a great investment of your money and time, since it is sure to help you in your future investments 
This book is really disappointing, because it has very little to do with the title of the book. It is a total waste of money. After reading this book, you will hardly thing like Graham and invest like Buffett. No chance! Read the first two books from Hagstrom and Buffetts letters to the shareholders. Dont by this one. Terrible 
I learned more from this book than all my history classes. It compresses the history of humans from the beginning telling facts using diagrams and maps. It tells us how the human world evolved from nothing to what it is today 
National Geographic Almanac of World History is a wonderful resource. The Chronological Chapters, Maps, Time-lines and Introductory Threads are easy to use. A very nice addition to add to your library 
As a reader I like to have quick reference books at my finger tips including a new version of the Oxford English Dictionary about 3500 pages long - that I use almost daily. So I decided to add a "history atlas". In the process of doing my research I read the other amazon.com reviewers and then made three trips to two large book stores to actually look at the books and get a better feel for which was the best. I ended up buying the Oxford Atlas of World History. Here are my picks and rankings. Listed by My ranking, #1 is the best, #2 is a creative alternative but no substitute. 1. Atlas of World History, Oxford University Press 2002, 368 pages, (...), 13.5" x 10.3" x 1.62" ranked 46,632 on Amazon.com. Hands down winner - professional - good text descriptions, outstanding maps and drawings, covers most things from the cave man forward. Negatives: Big and heavy. If you want to save a few dollars buy the "concise" version. 2. Creative alternative: The Penguin Atlas of World History, Penguin Books 2004, (...), just a paperback sized, just published, 304 pages. Surprisingly impressive, lots of text and pictures mixed together and it is easy to carry around. A nice quick alternative but it will be printed in two volumes. 3. Timelines of World History, DK Publishing 2002, 666 pages, (...). 10.0" x 1.6" ranked 25,800 on Amazon.com. Second with lots of value but in some ways not as comprehensive. 4. National Geographic Almanac of World History, National Geographic 2003, 384 pages, (...), 9.6" x 7.8" x 1.17" ranked 24,426 on Amazon.com. Similar to but less impressive than Oxford books. More text, narrower coverage, fewer maps and drawings. 5. DK Atlas of World History, DK Publishing, 352 pages,(...), 10.96" x 14.66" x 1.28" ranked 10,716 on Amazon.com. My last place book seems like a giant comic book. I love the DK travel books but this seems like one step beyond DK's area of expertise. Superficially it is similar to the Oxford book and it is cheap, and some might like it but it tries to be politically correct and fails. 6. Oxford Dictionary of World History, Oxford University Press, 704 pages, (...), pocketbook sized, sales rank 330,000. Mainly terms, people, and dates but has a few maps also. Limited use but an alternative. I prefer the new Penguin book but this is the best history dictionary to buy 
Excellent work by Patricia Daniels and Stephen Hyslop for National Geographic. A great volume to have in your hom 
This is a great read for anyone involved in any way with aviation; from the pilots to feds, to managers and engineers. The Boeing Company's history is covered in a way that gives a broad view of nearly the entire history of Aviation 
The One Percent Doctrine by Ron Suskind, Published by Simon and Schuster, 2006, 367 pages, is a great piece of investigative reporting. It goes in depth into the inside world of U.S. politics and policies. Before the table of contents Suskind chose to put a quote from Thomas Jefferson, "Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government." This quote serves as a good tone for the book. The One Percent Doctrine is not a "Bush" bashing book or something written for shock value, rather a book of information to help the American public. By keeping others informed through investigative reporting Suskind is continuing one of Americas greatest constitutional rights on a time when personal freedoms are being questioned every day. Suskind has had a long career in investigative reporting fifteen years ago and since the Bush administration took office has focused on reporting on the White House. In 1993 he began working for the Wall Street Journal until 2000 when he was then the senior national affairs reporter. While working there he won the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing as well as became a New York Times best selling author. The title of this book comes from a theory that Dick Cheney created. The doctrine states that if there is just a one percent chance of something happening, regarding the "war on terror," the United States is to act as if it was a certainty. Cheney himself said that "the war on terror" was not about the "analysis," rather the United States "response" however, this is one of the biggest flaws in policy that the book points out. The book begins on the day after the attacks on September 11th and takes you through the inner workings of the American political system for the next three years. It talks about the response to the attacks regarding Al Queda, Afghanistan, and ultimately the war in Iraq. Suskind divulges intimate knowledge of who knew what regarding the false information given the American public about Iraq. A lot of this information has become more public knowledge but at the time the book was published, in early 2006, but the book goes into great detail that few others have. The New York Times called the book, "An invaluable contribution both to the historical record and to the fierce public debate over the nature of the Bush administration's true views and motivations on issues of war and peace." As a historical record it is important for Americans now and generations after to know the truth and as far as the Bush administration's true views, the cold hard facts presented are hard to argue with. Knowing what our lawmakers and elected officials are doing allows us to hold them accountable for their actions and is part of the process that has been in place since America was a country. We need this kind of reporting to inform the public what is really going on so we can do our job as Unites States citizens. One of the most reveling things about this book is that it put the pieces together and shows that if congress or the American people knew everything that was going on behind the scenes, America would never have gone to war with Iraq. Congress can not do its job if it is not presented with all of the information needed to make an informed decision. Now it is one of the biggest political issues that has been putting politicians in an election year on the hot seat. Many senators and congress people who originally were for the war in Iraq have been pulling their support for years, especially when it was reveled that most of the intelligence the Bush administration gave as reasons to go to war were misleading, false, and much of it made up. Although the Bush administration has been quick to point to other reasons for the diminishing support for the war, using catch phrases like "flip-flopper," is simply not the case. This is a word that has been far over used and it is important for Americans to note the difference between the flip-flopping of politicans and the need to change their opinions as more information surfaces regarding the intelligence in support of the war. This is how congress does its job and it is better to have someone in office that can admit they were wrong and fix the situation instead of not doing anything and "staying the course." Free speech and press are some of our most important rights and are a key factors in separating our democracy from a dictatorship. Along with freedom of speech and press the Constitution provides a system of checks and balances to assure there is no abuse of power from the president. The system also includes a process called impeachment which allows for a series of steps to be taken for the removal of a president. Through Suskind's investigation of the Bush administration several impeach able offences that were committed by Bush and his staff have come to light. Regardless if a trial is set up or not, bringing the information from inside the White House to the public gives the chance to correct the situation and Americans can act as they see fit. The important part is to have the information to be available through venues like the press so that we are able to make the best choice. If we as a country allow one of our rights to be taken away there is northing to stop it from happening again. And if we do not know about what is going on in the first place then we lose our ability to act at all. America has already had the Patriot Act pushed upon us which all but eliminates the probably cause needed, according the our fourth amendment in the Bill of Rights, for any type of searches. Then America was faced with the illegal wiretapping the Bush Administration set up and used on everyday Americans, and their friends and family overseas. Recently, President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law. This allows for the president to hold people indefinitely without charge, sentence people to death based on poor intelligence, and take away the basic human rights of those detained. The most controversial and disturbing part of the bill is that it allows the president to eliminate habeas corpus, and eliminates most of the Bill of Rights. It is so important to know the information presented in the book that the book was originally recommended to me by a United States Senator currently in office. United States Senator Stabenow from Michigan recommenced the book based on what a good book it was on the subject of the war in Iraq. Between the One Percent Doctrine, the renewal of the Patriot Act, and the Military Commissions Act of 2006, there fewer and fewer choices left for Americans. Right now we are at a time where we have the choice to sit by idly, or get informed, outraged, and take action. Suskind ends his the book with another quote this time that is uniform in middle eastern as well as western religions. The quote is from Deuteronomy 16:20: "Justice, Justice, This you must pursue." As Ron Suskind states, justice is an overused word these days, I implore all to find the real meaning of justice and pursue it for yourself 
This is a book that every American should read. It gives previously unknown (or little known) details on the 'war on terror'. Among some of its revelations are: The one percent doctrine was spelled out by Dick Cheney and says that in the 'war on terror', if there is a one percent chance of an attack happening, our response needs to be as if there is a 100% chance of it happenning. It was driven by the new arithmetic of this conflict - even one successful attack can be devastating, but there are many potential ones, and being 100% sure the attack will happen is going to be almost impossible. The leader of the London 711 subway plot was a known terrorist conspirator who was refused entry into the US Bin Al Shibh was tortured but did not break Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) was tortured and he was told his children would be harmed, but he did not break. Abu Zubaydah, the first 'high level' Al-Qaeda captive, was crazy; with 3 split personalities, and actually just took care of travel arrangements for Al-Qaeda The US military deliberately bombed the Afghan offices of Al Jazera, to put pressure on the organisation, resulting in information from the Qatari leader that lead to KSM's capture There was a Cyanide attack plot by an Al-Qaeda affiliated organisztion that was in the final stages in the US, but it was not authorized by Al-Zawahiri and plenty more. The other interesting insight from the book is the shift in the way the presidency operates with George W Bush. Previous presidents would rely on the advice and recommendations of their government agencies. But George W Bush decides based on 'gut instinct', then asks for supporting evidence from the agencies. Pretty scary ! 
The One Percent Doctrine is a fascinating, chilling look at the War on Terror from the viewpoint of those on the inside. It's unsettling, because it reveals the stark choices an open society faces in choosing to fight a war in the shadows. It's an accounting of the efforts of people caught by the tsunami of 911 struggling to come up with a response: faceless bureaucrats, academics, politicos, intelligence professionals, law enforcement, the military, et. al. There are failures all too well known, 'successses' that weren't, and victories left unheralded. It's a conflict the U.S. hadn't prepared for, against an enemy that had been ignored and was largely unknown. Who are they - and what are they going to do next? Where? The One Percent Doctrine details how people came together to answer those questions - and are still trying to answer them today. The battlefield keeps shifting. If you've read Suskind's previous book, "The Price of Loyalty", you'll be getting a parallax view of the administration here. There are heros and villains, extremely capable people and incompetent hacks, and people just trying to do the best they can with the tools at hand. So much depends on the personal in this conflict that the element of chance is critical all too often. Compare what's in this book against what's been shown on the news, shouted from the campaign platforms, argued over by the pundits, and you won't sleep well tonight. But, you'll have a better understanding of what the stakes really are, how real the threats are, and just what kind of job Bush and the administration have been doing 
Everyone should turn off their tv's for a few hours and sit down and read this book. Simply the most informative book I've read this year. 
Very scary and enlightening. We'll drawn word pictures. There was almost not attribution of information, though 
The material presented in this book is absolutely fascinating. While much of it has been covered elsewhere, there are details of the inner workings of the Bush Administration and the CIA that are things that are unique to this book. Truly a fascinating read. It's a pity, then, that Suskind felt he needed to present this book like it's a spy novel. Each conversation is written out word for word, and each encounter is given as the fly-on-the-wall version. In addition, when he does analyse the implications of various encounters, he is rather repetitive. I think it loses credibility when presented like a novel. Despite this, it is a fascinating read 
Ron writes another riveting story of 'The Decider' aka GW Bush. Everyone should read this book, particularly those who voted for him in 2000 and again in 2004. Anyone with a logical brain and half history of the ME Region could anticipate that the foray into Iraq was misguided at best and a breach of trust at worst. America will need years to recover from this Fiasco (another fine book) as well as all the lives and money squandered in this poor attempt at a war on terror 
This book reads extremely fast. The page layout is attractive (just like the magazine), but alas this arrangement includes a lot of white space. Many of the tips are too familiar, e.g., sprinkling lemon juice on your fruit salad to prevent browning, and some advice is applicable only to homeowners or parents (I am neither - yet). Still, there is enough novel advice to make this volume worthwhile for a poor student who appreciates tips for organizing and entertaining. I recommend this for a housewarming gift. note: book is hardcover 
I'm a fan of Real Simple magazine, so this book hit the spot for me. It gives you ideas for reusing items. Now I know what to do with the stack of dryer sheets that I'd been saving. There are inexpensive tips and lots of how-to advice. Some may sound familiar, but there's bound to be some you had not thought of before. 
I like "Real Simple" magazine but I don't like saving the back issues. (I have enough clutter, believe me.) So the editors of this excellent magazine have compiled all kinds of tricks and ideas into this single volume. It's a lot of fun to read and has some very helpful stuff for keeping your home in order. The chapters include: 1. Grooming 2. Getting Dressed 3. In the Kitchen 4. In the Office 5. Cleaning 6. Decorating 7. Entertaining 8. Celebrating 1. Grooming includes how to unclog your drain. I am going to go try this; my bathroom sink is not draining properly. Here, you dump a cup of baking soda down and add a gallon of boiling water.. Naturally, the grooming section is homemade recipes for face scrub, toothpaste (?) and fun ideas like freezing aloe vera gel for sunburn relief--if you KNOW you are just going to go get burnt, you might as well prepare. 2. Getting Dressed has hints on mending, washing dainty things, 3. In the Kitchen--not the best part of the book, I thought, some basic recipes and how to use a wine bottle as an emergency rolling pin. 4. In the Office; someone peeked in my desk drawer at work, because there is a suggestion for supplies like toothbrush and toothpast and a lint roller, plus some basic makeup. I have this. They didn't find the hair dryer and shampoo I keep in the office bathroom in case I get drenched or sweated out and have to do my hair over at work..hahah. Another suggestion, spare house keys! Good idea. 5. The cleaning section has a stain removal guide, probably worth the book for this alone. 6. Decorating, lots of tips, but most useful, how to paint a room. 7. The entertainment section has fun things like freezing berries to make colorful ice cubes for summer drinks, and how to buy for a cocktail party. The book ends with all the marvelous things you can do with dental floss, aside from flossing between your teeth. Good for the newly-wed or just-got-first apartment couple. This is a pretty volume that would make a welcome gift for just about anyone 
Nice illustrations and pictures makes this dictionary very interesting for kids. it 
I bought this book for two sets of grandchildren. I had an opportunity to spend some time leafing through it with them. The Merriam Webster Children's Dictionary is, in my opinion, more than a dictionary, it is also like an encyclopedia. It does more than define words. It also uses great photos and illustrations to enlighten children and adults alike. One could spend hours just randomly sampling the pages. I'm sure it will be a very useful tool for the kids all through their elementary school years. I wish I had this book when I was a kid! 
I ordered this for my son who homeschools. We are doing 3rd 4th grades combined next year and this dictionary is perfect for elementary reference skills. He likes the colorful pictures and I think that the alphabet tabs on the page edge will be very useful to him when looking up words. Quite a nice book for the price 
Most DK products for children are outstanding and this is one of them. Well illustrated and comprehensive. It is a large hard back, not a small desktop reference. It is for third graders and up. The type is small and hard to read for children in lower grades. But my first grader loves the book because it is rich in features that fascinate him even though it is hard for him to read. He enjoys the flag section in the back and he enjoys the first rate gazetteer also in the back. Though it is for more advanced students, it is an invaluable tool for parents who have first and second graders and who assist or tutor their children. When children are first learning to read, they encounter many new words and they frequently ask parents what those words mean. It is challenging for parents to tell children the meaning of a word in terms that are simple enough for a child to understand. This dictionary is very helpful in that respect. While this dictionary has many illustrations, it would be more effective if it had more. But that is not a significant shortcoming. However, I would not use this dictionary as the first dictionary. I would recommend DK Children's Illustrated Dictionary as a starter. It is not nearly as comprehensive but it is simpler and better illustrated on individual words. For example the larger dictionary does not illustrate what a pot is but the Children's Dictionary does. It costs about the same as the Merriam Webster Children's Dictionary but it is worth the cost. There is also a My First Dictionary by Susan Miller which is also simpler and is easy for a beginner to use but it has only a 1,000 words. The explanations of the words are good but it does not include several of the features of the Children's Illustrated Dictionary. What could make this dictionary more useful would be an a table of contents for pages that contain only illustrations or consist mainly of illustrations on a particular subject. Often one can find a definition for an item, such as an animal, but not find an illustration of that animal, only to later find the illustration on an illustrated page of animals. Such a table of contents is inclused in DK Children's Illustrated Dictionary which is useful 
I highly recommend this as a first dictionary for school age children. I purchased this for my first grader and she loves it! It is compiled of great illustrations and filled with so much information. She will use this book for years 
This is a really good dictionary for kids. Gave it to the neighbor's 8-year old, and she loved it. It has lots of pictures and a pretty extensive vocabulary, so it'll get used for years 
This dictionary is indispensable for developing young minds who inquire at every turn, "What does ..... mean?" The beautifully illustrated, glossy cover advises that the contents include 32,000 entries and over 3,000 illustrations; this makes it a great vocabulary resource as well as being down right entertaining for kids. The pictures and illustrations are vividly colored, natural, not cartoonish, and very attractive. The publisher says this dictionary is designed for ages 8 and up, but why wait until then to buy it for your little scholar. There are 911 pages with many aids for learning. The typography is clear, easy to read and printed on very sturdy paper. One of the handiest features is the color coded indexing that helps you find the letter of the alphabet by looking at the open edge of the book. There's a simple guide to pronunciation printed at the bottom of each page, but it's only two pages wide and then reprinted on each page. One of my favorite features is the encyclopedic topical renderings that are interspersed throughout the dictionary. These give the young reader a look at a word with added details such as the context of the word and other valuable perspective. For example, the entry for "baseball" not only provides a definition of the word as "the ball" and "the game" but also illustrates the equipment used to play the game and shows the positions on the field. Our family has had this book for more years than I can remember and it has held up to exceptionally hard use which makes it an excellent value, in my opinion. Even when your "kid" progresses so far in the English language that he or she says "it's juvenile," you will still find him or her sneaking a peek at the definitions because if the word appears in this book you can be assured it will be simply understandable 
I have a 6 and 8 year old who love this book! My boys are able to look up words and understand the definitions without it being "too easy". The illustrations are great too! 
A lot has already been said about this novel, so I'll address my review to those unfamiliar with Mccarthy's work. If you've never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start. The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous. If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling "Blood Meridian." Some people will take issue with Mccarthy's grammar, sentence structure, use of Spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof). Mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning. The sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and "breath," meaning that they don't always look or sound like conventional prose. This will be displeasing to some. As an example, the first line of the book reads: "The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door." Now, Mccarthy could have just as easily said "the candle flickered when he entered the room," or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same. Read the first page of the book. If you don't catch fire at the beauty of it, then maybe this book, and Mccarthy's work in general, is not for you 
All the Pretty Horses is what I would imagine it would be like if Ernest Hemingway wrote a modern-day Western. Very rich language and vivid imagery, yet simple and direct dialogue. Not an especially complex plot and nothing unnecessary throughout, yet very deep emotionally. I'm eagerly making my way through the rest of the Border Trilogy and finding McCarthy a little more verbose and allegorical in The Crossing, but All the Pretty Horses has no wasted words in telling a fantastic story 
Dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up, 16-year-old John Grady Cole heads for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen. They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer. Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be. Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere. Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it. His long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel, and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the Texas/Mexico border region to vivid life. 
I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
All the Pretty Horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world. His personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his West Texas upbringing. His lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill, he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest. His journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness, moral dilemnas, and cruel lessons about human nature and survival. The best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by McCarthy. His style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags, punctuation, and quotation marks. This book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering 
Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway." I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives. 
When I read this book, I was completely impressed with the author's power to draw you into the scene of the story. I mean, I was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses - and I've never seen them in real life. This book is very well-written, and the imagery is powerful and moving. The main character, Cole, is chasing after a lifestyle that has passed. A life that is no more. He wants beauty in the world; all he finds is pain and sorrow. And maybe that is the way it is for all of us. We want what he wants, but reality crushes our view that this world can be made perfect if only this could happen...if only that could happen...It cannot. This is one of the most powerful themes in the book: we are all chasing a life that in many ways cannot exist in this world. 
This, the first book in Mccarthy's reputation making border trilogy, is what every novel should be: a good story told well. The book follows the adventures of a young boy as he travels with his best friend to mexico. Mexico in this novel is an ambiguous place and seems to be the last bastion, at least in the boys' minds, of a way of life that problebly never existed. The thing that breaks with other such narritives is that Mccarthy does not write in stone why the boys decide to leave their country. There is no hidden treasure one of the boys hear about or some crime they are tring to escape,they just go and you as a reader, I promise, will follow with them even when the going gets tough. And all the Cormac fans know that this writer's tough is a whole different monster than the standard breed to be found in most books. This may not be his best book, but that is like saying Portrait is not Joyce's best. McCarthy is a writer who will be remembered as someone who contributed something genuine to American letters. A must for any fan of literature or the western in general. 
PAGE 141 (punctuation is as the author intended) "...They'd ride at night up along the western mesa two hours from the ranch and sometimes he'd build a fire and they could see the gaslights at the hacienda gates far below them floating in a pool of black and sometimes the lights seemed to move as if the world down there turned on some other center and they saw stars fall to earth by the hundreds and she told him stories of her father's family and of Mexico. Going back they'd walk the horses into the lake and the horses would stand and drink with the water at their chests and the stars in the lake bobbed and tilted where they drank and if it rained in the mountains the air would be close and the night more warm and one night he left her and rode down along the edge of the lake through the sedge and willow and slid from the horses back and pulled off his boots and his clothes and walked out into the lake where the moon slid away before him and ducks gabbled out there in the dark. The water was black and warm and he turned in the lake and spread his arms in the water and the water was so dark and so silky and he watched across the still black surface to where she stood on the shore with the horse and he watched where she stepped from her pooled clothing so pale, so pale, like a chrysalis emerging, and walked into the water. She paused midway to look back. Standing there trembling in the water and not from the cold for there was none. Do not speak to her. Do not call. When she reached him he held out his hand amd she took it. She was so pale in the lake she seemed to be burning. Like foxfire in a darkened wood. That burned cold. Like the moon that burned cold. Her black hair floating on the water about her, falling and floating on the water. She put her other arm about his shoulder and looked toward the moon in the west do not speak to her do not call and then she turned her face up to him. Sweeter for the larceny of time and flesh, sweeter for the betrayal. Nesting cranes that stood singlefooted among the cane on the south shore had pulled their slender beaks from their wingpits to watch. Me quieres? she said. Yes, he said. He said her name. God yes, he said... 
I was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment. First off it's rare for such a new book (it was only published 14 years ago) to be a school assignment (well at my school it is). I suppose that says something for this book. It's the easiest read but not bad. Rather boring in places. It leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which I didn't like so much, and I definably found the end rather rushed. All in all, not my favorite book, but a good book in general. 
This book not only provides all the tools for a well-balanced and in-depth science/technology based curriculum, but it is also quite informative on it's own, and provides answers to many of the questions posed in other classes on a daily basis 
Author Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's retired Vice Chairman and COO, writes passionately about the company its founder, the late Sam Walton and its corporate culture. Once dubbed 'keeper of the culture,' he is not here to write a balanced, objective corporate biography. Instead, his admiration and respect for Walton and Wal-Mart shine from every line. He examines the company's workings from its humble beginnings to its rapid, phenomenal expansion. Soderquist describes Wal-Mart's commitment to its customers and employees, and describes its cost-cutting zeal. He details its use of new technology to revolutionize internal systems. These insights from the inside are very interesting, but - perhaps because the author was in the highest ranks of the company's leadership - the tone is so pro-Wal-Mart that it has the taste of public relations. However, if you seek immersion in this distinctive corporate culture and want to emulate the principles that worked for it, we stand beside the big glass doors and welcome you to Wal-Mart. Do you need a shopping cart 
Reading this book you get to know a humble, God-fearing man who pursues excellence in everything he does. Don Soderquist would never say so, but he is a great American and a role model for any young businessman. And Wal*Mart is proof that the strong American work ethic is really what makes our corporations so successful. Not the 'exploitation' schtick that the demented newscasters constantly try to peddle. 
For me, this book wasn't primarily about Wal-Mart. It was about a man who took his principles to work with him and became incredibly significant. In a world severly lacking in principle driven living, it shines as a beacon. Here's an example: The closest competitor prices a product at $19.95. Wal-Mart prices it at $14.86. Why doesn't Wal-Mart raise their price to $17.95, beating the competition but earning $3 more on every unit? Answer: Because Wal-Mart believes it holds a fair profit margin at $14.86 and wants the customer to have the lowest possible price. (Page 94) That's principle driven marketing. I learned about the ten foot rule: When a Wal-Mart associate comes within ten feet of a customer, he or she is to look up, look the customer in the eye, and speak to the customer. If the customer asks where something is, the associate does not tell the customer, but takes the customer to the product. (page 91) That's principle driven customer service. The development of corporate culture as a combination of shared vision, shared values, shared purposes, and shared expectations was helpful to me (Page 25). It was interesting to see how the corporate culture was promoted in Wal-Mart. I believe I can apply these principles in my life, so this book really speaks to me. Forget about your pre-judgments of Wal-Mart, good or bad, and harvest a gold mine of life principles from these pages. I would use this as required reading in a college leadership class. George A. Goolde 
Wal-Mart is simultaneously admired, feared, loved and hated depending on from which perspective one looks at this giant retailer. In this book, the author's view is that of an insider, one who is passionately involved with the company's growth for over two decades and who has lived by the core principles and beliefs of the company and finally reaching the position of COO and vice-chairman. This book is not a business story of Wal-Mart or a biographical outline of its founder. However, background knowledge of the world's biggest company will help in understanding the basic principles that helped it reach the current position rapidly with a clear vision and determination. Frankly, my admiration for Wal-Mart has substantially increased after reading this book. This is not because I am in complete agreement with what can perhaps be termed as one-sided view for the author. The difference lies in the listing of the 12 core principles on which the company has been built and continues to grow rapidly even after reaching the magic figure of World # 1. In terms of its global sourcing strategy, Wal-Mart procures aggressively from low cost locations especially China. This has resulted in reduced prices and abundant supply of merchandise in America. This practice is often accused as taking away of jobs from America and instead creating sweat shops in China. The book challenges these allegations and explains the global supply chain strategies that need to be emulated by any multinational. What I found more interesting about the book is that about certain assumptions that we may make about business strategy. For example, in simple economic terms, price elasticity of demand means lower prices would ensure higher sales for most merchandise. However, Wal-Mart is driven by customer satisfaction and the commitment to putting an extra dollar into the average American consumer's pocket as the drivers and enablers that increase sales. Price reduction is the effect and not the bait. The incident where a lady customer is given a free frying pan by the manager of a Wal-Mart store, just based on her declaration that she had lost the one she bought in the parking lot while taking it home is a good example of how much the employees are driven primarily by customer satisfaction and not just by sales targets. Learning from competitors is another great trait that has been well explained. Wal-Mart not only excels in customer service within its stores. Its truck drivers for example have helped many people who needed help on the roads especially women struck with vehicle breakdowns during late evening hours. What more can customers expect. No wonder they keep coming back again and again to what is now and will remain the planet's biggest company as long as it continues to pursue its 12 core principles in action and in spirit 
I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult. I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman. I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly 
Outstanding book! Very challenging and encouraging to read. Describes the "man" who had a clear purpose and vision, was able to focus on it, and communicate and motivate his team around him in achieving success. 
This review is an adaptation of my review published in Personnel Psychology, Winter 2004 issue. As one of the pioneers in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement, Hollender is evangelical about promoting the implementation of CSR "in all of its forms." I'm not sure I know what he means by that. As he acknowledges, it's in the "mind of the beholder" because there's "no firm consensus" about what CSR means. I certainly can't criticize him for not pinning down the concept. Professor Ronald Sims (2003), in his own book on the subject for instance, has offered five different definitions. I think Hollender equates CSR with the idea of a triple-bottom line of responsibility and accountability for fulfilling what he thinks should be the financial, social, and environmental obligations of a corporation. Margaret Mead once said in effect that social change always starts and can only start with a small group of people. The small group identified in the book as pioneers in the CSR movement include small business entrepreneurs like Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, socially responsible investment funds like the Calvert Social Investment Fund, and a host of advocacy groups or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like the activist group, Greenpeace, and the more reserved Businesses for Social Responsibility (BSR) that was conceived as sort of an alternative Chamber of Commerce. The book gives an interesting account of the different ways in which these pioneers promote CSR among big corporations. One way, for instance, is non-confrontational and educative in trying to "bring big business [no matter how socially irresponsible] to the table and then move the table." For example, BSR works closely with big companies to promote a set of best practices that hopefully will not only further the CSR progress of those companies but also entice other companies not to be left behind. Another way is confrontational, involving pressure tactics and sometimes law suits. Greenpeace, for example, gradually succeeded in pressuring Royal Dutch Shell to choose a more environmentally responsible way to dispose of an obsolete oil storage tanker and loading platform in the North Sea. As you can well imagine, the notion of CSR is controversial and fraught with issues. The authors clearly know that and for the most part deal with the issues relatively well in my opinion. I'll mention and discuss a few of the issues. Perhaps the biggest issue is over what should be the legitimate purpose of business. Hollender, understandably, totally rejects what he considers to be the "hysterical" opinion of conservative economist Milton Friedman that CSR is "fundamentally subversive" and that the only legitimate responsibility of business is to make an honorable profit. To Hollender, CSR "in all of its forms" is the legitimate purpose. Thus a corporation that seeks to ameliorate public problems not of its own making is a more socially responsible company. He cites Coca Cola as an example of a company persuaded by activists to modify its operations in ways to further the prevention and treatment of AIDS among its employees and those of its bottlers and suppliers. Three related issues are over who should be the public corporation's legitimate stakeholders, for what should it be held accountable, and over what period of time. To people in Friedman's camp, the issues are no-brainers. Shareholders are the only stakeholders, the corporation is only accountable for maximizing their wealth and doing so through legal means, and time is marked in quarterly returns. This view is basically that the conventional bottom line is the only one that must matter. To people like Hollender, the issues are also no-brainers. Absolutely everyone and everything, including the environment, along the company's long value chain from initial product resources to product disposal are the company's stakeholders, the company must be held accountable through full and transparent cost accounting to every one of those stakeholder interests, and time is marked in the long run. The conventional bottom line is thus immensely modified quantitatively and qualitatively. I found the authors a bit lax in relying on several of their sources about one important matter bearing on those three issues. The sources were quoted as claiming that boards of directors have a statutory obligation to maximize shareholder wealth in the short term. I questioned that claim, and one of Hollender's spokespersons acknowledged that it was a mistaken claim. But this nevertheless doesn't negate the immense pressure CEO's are under to hit the numbers each quarter. This pressure comes primarily from institutional investors who might as well be surrogates for a statute. It takes a morally courageous CEO and a sustainable company to resist that kind of pressure. In an article featuring Hollender and Bill George, the recently retired CEO of Medtronic, the latter commented that he would say at every annual shareholder meeting that the company was "not in the business of maximizing shareholder value," and he believed he "got away with that because the results were so good" (Kelly, 2004). Another related issue is over how much self-disclosure there should be of a firm's CSR performance. Hollender proposes full "transparency," yet acknowledges that it can make the company squirm, as his did, over risking the possibility that full disclosure may end up making the company legally liable for a product shortcoming that might not otherwise ever be known. He agonized, for example, that while one of his products was more "natural' than that of any of his competitors, he was sure some of his customers at least presumed that his product "was a bit better than it actually was." Not being a fanatically unrealistic CSR advocate, he decided to put a "product self-critique section" on his company's Web site instead of putting a disclaimer on the product's packaging. It's a compromise, yes, but far more responsible than the values held and practiced by a baby food maker I remember as once having been charged with diluting its product. Another related issue is whether to take a public company private to escape Wall Street analysts and record-keeping requirements. More public companies are apparently going private, and Hollender himself is a case in point. He took his firm private, and that is what it still is today. He points to the private outfitter, Patagonia, as being able to take socially responsible actions much more easily than if it were traded on Wall Street. Yet another issue addressed, and the last one of theirs I'll mention, is over whether a small, socially responsible company should "sell out" to a larger corporation. An advantage of doing so besides making a lot of money from the sale is the prospect of a responsible product being introduced to a much larger market. But a disadvantage is that the seller risks seeing its values and practices diminished if not overturned altogether by the larger corporation. The authors describe how Ben and Jerry initially felt they had negotiated a deal with Unilever, the buyer of their company, to preserve the values the two pioneers held dear, only to learn later of some actions taken by Unilever incompatible with the values. The authors claim that the CSR movement has become a "contagious trend." I think that's a bit exaggerated, and the authors offer little hard data to back up their claim. I think it is true that CSR is becoming a more popular topic, but I suspect, and the authors acknowledge, that it lends itself to tokenism or lip service for the sake of appearances or reputation. That's why incidentally I chose to mention the authors' examples of Shell and Coke. Shell reportedly regards the North Sea experience positively and claims there is now "increasingly open and honest communication with the communities," yet we read recently that its two top executives were forced to resign after lying for several years about the company's oil reserves (see, e.g., Timmons, 2004). As for Coke, it's frequently in the news for its "cozy ties to strong arm dictators and rogue bottlers" and for other alleged wrongdoing (see, e.g., Klebnikov, 2003). I could also have mentioned wrongdoing by some of the other companies the authors cite as making progress of one kind or another in their CSR performance. My point is that with so much harmful wrongdoing being committed by public corporations, I would far prefer to see a relatively more restrained movement, one that "simply" calls for public corporations to operate "harmlessly." Achieving that standard would be a quantum leap from prevailing corporate behavior, and I think corporations should direct their resources to taking that leap and not diverting them to the solving of problems not of their own making or to giving guilt gifts through philanthropy or to offering isolated token efforts. The book is intended for a wide audience, including business leaders, employees, and NGOs. I personally think it deserves to be on a best seller list and should be read by the CEO of every public corporation who has yet to decide where to position his or her company on the CSR spectrum. I also think all thoughtful citizens should read this book. It matters a lot. REFERENCES Kelly, M. (2004).

The CEO of Seventh generation, Jeffrey Hollender, pens this book on responsible business. I came across this book because Seventh Generation recently decided to sell their wares through Target instead of Wal-Mart. Most small businesses would love to be courted by the Wal-Mart retailing giant but Jeffrey Hollender felt that Target agreed more with Seventh Generation. In this book, Jeffrey discusses his thoughts on running a responsible business. The opening chapters were somewhat difficult to get through. Perhaps it just took several pages for me to get used to his prose? The underlying message I felt was that having a socially responsible business is possible but will require a lot of work on everyone's part. Everyone is so connected to each other now. Perhaps an environmental conscious entrepreneur decides to open a chain of organic restaurants and ensures that farmers are paid a fair price. But what if the restaurant hires an exterminator that uses a toxin that ends up contaminating the soil for generations? The idea is to have a closed-loop business model ... that leaves things in the same condition as when the company began. For example, think of the credo of camping sites. Moreover, the closed loop business model is more than just your business but includes your suppliers and customers. Specifically, there are hidden costs to disposal of things like electronics and the ubiquitous clear plastic bags. Of course, we every day consumers can throw them in the trash for someone else to deal with. But someone does deal with our trash and there are some real costs. The book gives a story of a putrid land in China where a lot of our electronic waste goes. I have always loved companies that are transparent with their business models from a financial perspective. Transparency is about communicating to shareholders, consumers, and employees. Transparency is about being candid and introspective on dealings and reasoning for decisions. There are a mixed bag of corporate stories mainly with Ben Jerry Ice Cream (who is now part of Unilever) and Seventh Generation. There is of course some mention of Johnson and Johnson's Tylenol case and also on electronic companies like Hewlett Packard and Dell. There is some applause for British Petroleum for a decision to put no money to politics and Shell who compromised with Greenpeace on an issue in Africa. Surprisingly this is a well thought out book that doesn't get hysterical. It's honest, transparent and I recommend it 
I found the book to be uplifting. It is nice to see this type of behavior being practiced. We have entered a time in our existence where we have to start thinking of how we operate as an industrialized country. Chris Ortiz, author of 40+: Overtime Under Poor Leadershi 
Another leader of an iconic "green company", Jeffrey Hollender - founder and CEO of Seventh Generation (yes, I use their laundry detergent exclusively) discusses the challenges of running a business with high integrity and full disclosure. In particular, Hollender recounts Seventh Generation's stint as a publicly traded company and posits that public ownership inevitably leads to an erosion of core values by the pressures of the markets. He cites also the example of Ben and Jerry's take-over by Unilever. I personally believe that positive social change can be wrought through the public securities markets and that values driven investing is the most significant tool available. I appreciate What Matters Most as a cautionary tale keeping me alert to some of the perils of my chosen approach (Socially Responsible Investing as a vehicle for change). I had the privilege of hearing Jeffrey Hollender speak at a Working Assets brown bag lunch lecture. He is a forceful presence and very inspiring in his forthrightness in answering questions probing the gray areas that an ethical company must struggle with. P.S. A recent addition to my review: The Resources section at the back of the book is very well researched and thorough. It would be worth buying the book merely for that appendix. 
As a professor management who is interested in corporations acting more responsibly, I have just begun to use this book in my senior strategic management course. Hollender is a thoughtful and insightful proponent of socially responsible business. Each chapter covers a specific characteristics of SRB (accountability, transparency, sustainability, etc.). He recognizes that running a company using these principles is not easy but definitely worth it. He covers most of the pioneers in the field (Roddick, Cohen, Anderson, Chouinard) and their struggles to live their corporate lives in a responsbile way. I highly recommend it. Dale Fitzgibbon 
This is an insider's stroll through the confusing and ominous woods where the beasts of economic reality meet the lambs of social responsibility. Author and corporate survivor Jeffrey Hollender (who wrote this with scribe Stephen Fenichell) clearly admires the cast of socially responsible companies, such as Ben &amp; Jerry's and The Body Shop. He covers the informal history of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) movement and his own troubling experiences as chief of a company that saw itself as socially responsible. His presentation is heartfelt, if short on rigorous logic. He candidly discusses having his ideals challenged and trying to justify his compromises. The book labels some behavior socially responsible and some socially irresponsible, but its yardstick is not clear. For example, it condemns the use of child factory labor in developing countries, yet never expresses awareness of the lack of practical alternatives for those children - perhaps starvation. The book explores both the value of the Corporate Social Responsibility movement and its uncomfortable contradictions. We recommend this trip inside the hard work of melding social responsibility with business 
 Noam Chomsky's critical analysis of U.S. hegemony is on point. He uncovers the U.S. government's recidivism. One particular case was President Reagan's terror campaign in Nicaragua. The excuse was that communism was beckoning at our doorstep. Nicaragua had become the second Cuba in the eyes of the knee-jerk Right. But what really transpired was Reagan's attempt to overthrow the Sandinistas with U.S. trained Contras. When congress became concerned over this injustice (for financial reasons of course) the Reagan Administration began selling weapons to Iran, further financing their terrorist war in Latin America. Reagan in the 1980's wanted regime change in Latin America and in 2006, history repeats its self since George W. Bush is continuing Reaganite policy in the Middle East. The tactics Bush is currently using might be construed as different but the results are still the same. These campaigns aren't much different than George Washington's campaign to eviscerate the Iroquois, which Chomsky briefly alludes to in the book but for more information on the subject I strongly recommend reading "The American Indian Wars" by John Tebbel and Keith Jennison. Howard Zinn's book "A Peoples History of the United States" also covers this subject. Chomsky delineates about the 1961 campaign called Operation Mongoose: "Operation Mongoose was the centerpiece of American policy toward Cuba from late 1961 until the onset of the 1962 [Cuban] Missiles Crisis." This was a result of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. "Operation Mongoose, also known as the Cuban Project, is the general name for CIA covert operations and plans from 1961-1962 to destabilize and overthrow the Communist government in Cuba." (Quoted from Wikipedia). Chomsky covers many subjects such as the Israel/Palestine conflict, which the U.S. sends more financial and military aid to Israel than all other countries combined. Iraq is also a humongous issue that Chomsky successfully tackles since World War II the U.S. government has participated in more than fifty wars and to this very day is continuing with their plans of hegemony in the Middle East, Latin America and other countries abroad. This is all transpiring either without the knowledge or consent of American citizens. It is estimated that the Bush Administration has spent more than $300 billion in Iraq, and Afghanistan. These are disheveling developments considering the Congressional Budget Office estimates that another $450 billion will be needed in the next ten years. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear weapons program isn't included in the defense budget its part of the energy budget, and intelligence gathering is in the Black Box budget program. It is estimated by 2008 that the U.S. will have 14 nuclear-armed submarines in the Pacific armed with 336 Trident 2 ballistic missiles with 2,000 nuclear warheads. And in spite of this debauchery, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said, "We're trying to figure out how you conduct a war against something other than a nation-state and how you conduct a war in countries that you are not at war with." This is nonsensical hegemony in motion; the bottom line is the Neo-Cons are planning to wage a never-ending war campaign against the entire world. Just ponder on this for a moment. Half of the United States' aircraft carrier fleet occupies the Pacific Ocean, plus the U.S. has over 1,000 military bases worldwide. Knowing that this is the case: one must take a step back and become a little more circumspect when gazing at Bush's Neo-Con panorama and inquire about the issues of Medicare, Education, Food Stamps and Veterans Insurance, simply because the elites are also waging a war campaign against the American people. The world is involved in a grave war for its survival against an elite system set up to enslave many and genocide the rest. This book is a comprehensive history of U.S. hegemony gone tumultuously awry. From George Washington to George W. Bush. This book compiles 230 years of U.S. imperialism in the continental United States and the whole entire world. Moreover, I would like to point out to all the reactionaries who'll give my review a bad rating, that this isn't about racism or religion. It's about the elites' mad proclivities for empire, and if you don't wake up soon, and see it for what it really is then our world will not survive. Wake up! You reactionaries will not be apart of the new world order ruling class because you're enslaved by it already. As a matter of fact we are all slaves to this system of world government. And in this system, some of us will remain thralls and the rest are expendable. Remember 9/11 was an inside job. The government committed several heinous acts on that day just so we'd rescind our Constitutional Freedoms. Chomsky has stated that he doesn't believe that 9/11 was an inside job and I have to say that I totally disagree with his assessment on the matter, but I still think Hegemony or Survival is an essential read that we must all look at.  
Provides overwhelmingly truthful information about America and the rest of the world. It is a "must read" in order to understand all of the events taking place today 
I doubt this book would have garnered so much attention had not Hugo Chavez waived it front of the UN assembly decrying US imperial ambitions. The book quickly soared to the top of most bestselling lists, and briefly topped amazon book sales. I well imagine Noam Chomsky had to crack a smile, as it turns out that people do take notice when someone questions American authority, and this is what this book is all about. Chomsky rides roughshot over 20th and early 21st century American history in making his case for its long held imperial ambitions. He traces the ideological origins to Wilson, but he easily could have gone back to McKinley and Roosevelt, the first for plunging the US into the ill-advised Spanish-American War, and the latter for building a military juggernaut that would eventually save the day in WWI. Chomsky could have even gone back to James Polk, who similarly raised an unnecessary panic and plunged the US into the Mexican War, which turned out to be nothing more than a huge land grab, virtually doubling the size of the US back in 1848. A book well worth reading is Bernard De Voto's 1846: Year of Decision. In many ways, Chomsky echoes De Voto in his attack on American imperial ambitions. He brings the scenarios up do date, by focusing on America's new role as hegemon since the end of WWII, after its major rivals were either crushed or severely weakened. Rather than seek compromise, the US relished its new role in shaping the world for a variety of reasons, ostensibly keeping open a so-called economic free market that favored its corporate interests. No president escapes Chomsky's vitriolic attack, including Carter, who refused to provide badly needed relief following a devastating hurricane in the Caribbean because the island countries wouldn't refuse to renounce Grenada, which had the audacity to pursue a quasi-Marxist line in its new government. Later, Reagan would crush the small nation to show the American iron hand in the region, which extended back to the Spanish-American War. But, the two presidents who Chomsky most takes to task are Clinton and Bush for using preventive war in new and audacious ways that have severely comprised the role of the UN as an international arbitrator. Chomsky attacks Clinton on the Kosovo War, and strenuously challenges the Bush White House position of "just wars" in Afghanistan and Iraq. The book takes events up to 2004, providing a lot of valuable background information and illustrating the ideological origins of the current "war on terror." He makes a direct link between the Bush II administration and the Reagan/Bush I administration both in terms of language and actions, but points out that while the first set of wars were largely subversive, the current ones are blatantly aggressive and defy all international laws, much less ethics. You can take Chomsky's aggressive stance anyway you want, but the book is heavily footnoted and the facts he presents largely hold up. It is nice to see that the mainstream media is finally taking note, and challenging the presidential administration, after giving him what amounted to a "free pass" in his first term 
After accurately addressing the current state of affairs in the United States government, which can be called by many names - Chomsky uses polyarchy - he radically reframes the last several decades of U.S. history in impressive detail, and his work is to be commended. My major criticism is that he gave far too little attention to the idea of polyarchy and the problems it attempts to address. Such an issue bitterly divided the Founders, but is far older than the United States - Plato dwelled on it in "The Republic." He saw a democracy as nothing but a wreckless mob, and that they must be ruled like children by "guardians," who live apart from the masses and consider the good of the people more important than their own. Of course such guardians are very rare - for every Marcus Aurelius or Diocletian there are half a dozen Nero's and Caligula's. Although Bush is particularly odious his policy is merely at the extreme of a narrow spectrum, as Chomsky acknowledges. So a system run by an elite will naturally reflect the interests of the elite and not of those whom they govern. Chomsky makes that very clear and that is one of work's best messages. But what to replace it? Lenin would have us believe that even a cook should be able to run a country, but I doubt most people would agree. Jefferson also trusted the people, but was he too idealistic? What should replace this corrupt polyarchy? Although Chomsky offers no solution, it is still an important and informative work 
This is the most lucid, convincing and rightfully scathing interpretation of American foreign policy I've ever read. Absolutely brilliant. 
I was one of apparently many who went to the Amazon website to look for Chomsky's book, once Chavez recommended it. I am familiar with Chomsky's reputation as a prolific writer of books on politics. I've tried to plow through some of his works on linguistics. Not easy, although the sense one gets as a non-scholar is that he is onto something original in those works. I'm glad he has shifted focus to politics. He looks at facts pure and simple. He, as are many other Americans, is rightfully disgusted with the idiocy, wanton destructiveness, frightening arrogance and brazen dishonesty of the policies and actions of the current Bush Administration. As he points out repeatedly however in Hegemony, American foreign policy has generally followed a similar, although certainly less destructive, path in most earlier Administrations. His comments on actions by the Clinton Administration in the Balkans, in particular in Kosovo, are enlightening. Underlying his exposition and analysis of the facts is of course his recurring thesis that Americans are deluged by propaganda and lies initiated by the government which are then willingly distributed by most - and unquestionably by the the most seen or read - media outlets. He is right on the mark. It takes very little effort in the current Internet-accessible world to find original sources on most subjects, so finding the facts related to almost any topic or allegation is a few mouse clicks away. The problem, in regard to the pursuit and dissemination of the truth however, is that so few people make the effort! In any case, since this is my first reading (I have seen the documentary on Manufacturing Dissent) exposure to Chomsky's political analysis, I must say that Hugo Chavez made an excellent selection. At least this shows he reads, unlike George Bush. 
I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations. He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe. We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in. On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course" What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas. I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion. Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven. Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong. I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity. Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how. I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked? I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon. Cheer 
That's how the rest of the world views him. I agree. I first began reading Chomsky back in the early 1990s and plan to pick this book up this afternoon. I am giving it a 5 star rating ahead of time to counter the one star ratings given it by the rightwingers who will never actually read it and who simply attack whatever they are told to attack by the likes of Rush Limbaugh 
Noam Chomsky is one of the most noteworthy and influential intellectuals of modern times. Whether you like him or not, in my opinion, everyone should read his books in order to get a general yet very insightful view of current political affairs and their historical and philosophical backgrounds. His unflinching motivation to unearth the truths behind many political events, bold character, and extraordinary ability to see and make sensible connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena is absolutely outstanding. This book is a product of post-9/11 era, but contains a lot of information in regards to USA's preceding quests for global dominance, too. On page 2, he mentions a very common trait of humans which one cannot help but accept: "...a hypothetical extraterrestrial observer might well conclude that humans have demonstrated that capacity throughout their history, dramatically in the past few hundred years, with an assault on the environment that sustains life, on the diversity of more complex organisms, and with cold and calculated savagery, on each other as well." There is a very conspicuous fact that the leaders of the USA would not understand in many ways, which is mentioned on page 4 as follows: "...there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion ("the United States" here meaning state power, not the public or even elite opinion." When I was a little boy in the 1980's, I was hearing the US military operations (direct or indirect) in Central America, but could not figure out what was happening exactly. In order to see the whole picture, one should read this book and compare with the news published and aired in media channels in those days. One would see that there is a stark difference between the aforementioned sources. The author bases many of his ideas on John Ikenberry's very interesting comment which is "...a grand strategy [that] begins with a fundamental commitment to maintaining a unipolar world in which the United States has no peer competitor, a condition that is to be permanent [so] that no state or coalition could ever challenge [the US] as global leader, protector and enforcer." On page 12, the author argues very successfully the question that many Americans could not find a satisfactory answer in their minds. They wonder why many countries, which exhibited immense support and sympathy to the USA right after 9/11, turned their support away from the USA during the Iraqi war. The book says "...the global wave of sympathy that engulfed the United States after 9-11 has given way to a global wave of hatred of American arrogance and militarism, and even in friendly countries the public regards Bush as a greater threat to peace than Saddam Hussein." Chomsky describes the driving philosophy behind the Reagan and Bush administrations as "...the US reserved the right to act unilaterally when necessary, including the unilateral use of military power to defend such vital interests as ensuring uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources." He describes the motto of the Cheney-Rumsfeld-Powell trio as well above and beyond a defensive instinct and goes on to say "...officially declaring an even more extreme policy, one aimed at permanent global hegemony, by reliance on force where necessary." Another world leader, Nelson Mandela, who had immensely suffered from oppression and repression, condemned Tony Blair for "encouraging international chaos, together with America, by ignoring other nations and playing policeman of the world." The USA made a series of severe mistakes where it forbade other nations on the same issues. On page 26, it is mentioned as "...after 9-11, often with questionable relation to terror, the Bush administration claimed, and exercised, the right to declare people -including US citizens- to be `enemy combatants' and to imprison them without charge or access to lawyers or family until the White House determines that its `war on terror' has been successfully concluded." The author quotes the famous "regime change" phenomenon as "...regime change does not mean a regime that Iraqis might prefer, but one that the conqueror will impose, calling it democratic...". This bring the question that how effective, realistic and long-lasting this artificial democracy would be, in the hands of people who have absolutely no knowledge and experience. On page 41, there are interesting statistics as to how some nations think of the USA and its current political ambitions. The following chapters of the book has a great deal of well-scrutinized historical examples in which the USA was, in some way and to some extent, involved politically, militarily, and economically such as the Middle East, Central and South America, and Asia. There are vivid examples about the ideas and presumptions mentioned in the first 40-50 pages of the book. One should read the book for further discussions. There is an interesting fact stated on page 130; Jack Straw of UK released a report on Saddam's crimes in 2002, but it was drawn almost entirely from the period of firm US and UK support, a fact which was grossly overlooked. Of course, this does not mean that Saddam was a fine leader; he was, in fact, a vicious dictator with a perverted mind and excessive cruelty. The USA invented the terms "Old Europe" and "New Europe" describing the anti-war European countries and countries who gave direct support to USA's Iraqi operation respectively. This discrimination caused some tension among European countries. The details can be found in the book. There is a noteworthy historical turning point in Turkey mentioned on page 135 and onwards as "...in the end, the Turks proceeded to teach a lesson in democracy to the West. Parliament finally refused to allow US troops to be deployed fully in Turkey..." and implicitly criticized as follows: "Strong governments disregard their populations and accept the role assigned to them by the global ruler; weak governments succumb to the will of 95% of their population." The following chapters mention the relationships between the USA and countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East (e.g. Balkans, Turkey, Israel, Iran, S.Arabia et al.). The rest of the book presents very strong and useful advice to the US government as to how they can construct and sustain viable, healthy, peaceful, and long-lasting relations with other countries without repeating the old mistakes which were proven to be absolutely wrong and conducive to animosity and resentment. There are very valuable lessons regarding how the entire World can benefit from mutually respectful administrations and how strong, democratic societies can be built on solid grounds. Overall, this book is very much recommended to those who would like to see and understand the current political phenomena which were not covered by some right-wing, biased media. 
I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16 
This book is not thick, and it has just the right amount of detail to balance the events. Here we follow Carrie White, a bullied high school girl with a paranormal gift, sheltered by her religiously sick mother ("The first sin was intercourse, say it!"). Carrie receives an invitation from a popular boy to the Prom, and of course, it is a cruel prank...and Carrie's gift has the last laugh. Dark and demented, but shows how King is in a league of his own. August 11, 200 
King created a world where you believe in the possiblity of people like Carrie White. He looks at the situations from so many angles that you know everything there is to know and feel thankful for it. Its another book that I just couldn't put down. Reading it was a rewarding experience. Also, recommended are King's collections of short stories, like Night Shift 
This is where the genius started his famous reputation and talent. If had not been for his wife (she saved the original manuscript), we probably woud not have the 1976 classic or anything else King related. Everyone shoud give this start of King's genius a look 
Stephen King's first book is well written, and he paints an image of high school that most will identify with (peer pressure, bullying, interaction between very different social and economic classes). The plot centers around a young girl Carrie, and her struggle to fit into high school due to her extremely religious mother. Due to the movie's iconic images, I'm sure most people will know what's going to happen before even picking up the book. Still, it is an entertaining and worthwhile read. My one complaint is that King writes in a journalistic fashion (including interviews, pages from other "made-up" books) to build the whole story about what happens to Carrie. The style (which King borrows from Bram Stoker's Dracula according to his introduction for Carrie) detached me from the story--it focused on POVs from side characters that weren't interesting. It also lessened the impact of some of the novel's suprises and twists. However, the book is worth checking out and much shorter than King's later and sometimes overbloated novels 
Carrie is one of my favorite King novels, for it's loosely based on his memory of two girls in his school who were picked on 'without mercy'. I first read this novel in high school where Carrie White's character was unfortunately present. I recall girls who were emotionally, and sometimes physically, battered by classmates and was once badgered by a bully myself. This book is also part of the early 'raw energy' of Stephen King as a writer, before he was launched into legendary status as a popular horror novelist. Though there isn't a happy ending in 'Carrie', I'm still able to sympathize with her character and see some justice in her wicked vengeance. This novel will remain on my bookshelves, safe from any future garage sales, and re-visited often. Chrissy K. McVay Author of 'Souls of the North Wind 
I DEDICATE THIS Review TO WOMEN ALL AROUND THE WORLD OF ALL COLOUR,RACES,RELIGIONS,NATIONALITY AND CREED...(ALL WOMEN ARE EQUAL,IN MY EYES....Nigel..) In this remarkable novel,SK makes his debut.An unlikely but good book.It has a good dose of horror/suspense and it is one of the best books I have ever read... It is simply about a teenager from Maine,named Carietta White(Carrie).From the beginning of the story we see who her mother(Margaret white)takes advantage of her,making her feel stupid and left out.Similiarly in school,Carrie is always the "Black sheep",she has not friends and she is always picked upon.She is very unusual and strange,at least to most people,especially the ones in the book(story).(but I would say quite frankly that I didn't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl.) At the beginning of the story we also see that Carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school.She is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her.This is her first big humiliation.(I am a guy,I know not much about a period,so please forgive my use of the term openly) Anyway,back to the plot:Carrie soon realizes that she is Psychic.She starts to practice using her powers gradually.It seems as though she had the powers since birth,but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it. So,so far we see this:a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother. The story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end. Allow me..... It is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic.Carrie's mother explains alot of things,but she is still a bad mother. (but I still can't hate carries's mother,because most mothers are sort of protective over their children) Soon Carrie gets her first friend Sue.Sue feels sorry for Carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom. This date is Tommy Ross... Meanwhile,one of the bad girls,Chris,is unable to attend the prom.So,she sets up a nasty revenge against Carrie.Believe me when I tell you,Chris is a very jealous girl and if she can't have something,no one else can,especially Carrie. So Chris arranges a trap for Carrie.(Two buckets of pig blood) She sets it up for the pig blood to fall on Carrie's and Tommy's head while at the prom... The plan eventually succeeds. Tommy is badly injured. Drenched in pig's blood,Carrie is laughed at,for the last time.She runs out of the building.She then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge. She starts to close all the doors.She then turns on all the water sprinklers,wetting everyone. But with a combination of water and electricity(from the appliances)....some were electrocuted. Eventually a fire gets started.And things start to burn! She walks toward her home,burning everything within a certain radius of her powers. When she reaches home her mother tries to kill her,telling her that she is the spawn of satan.She eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers' heart beat,killing her. Eventually(this is the good part of the book),while Carrie is walking on the streets(going I don't know where)she seens Chris and Chris's boyfriend driving towards her,to bounce her. Carrie uses her powers to diverge to car,killing Chris and her stupid boyfriend. Sue eventually catches up with Carrie.Carrie doesn't kill her because she realizes that it wasn't Sue's falt but Chris's. (During the battle with her mother,Carrie was stabbed,I forgot to mention it,sorry.) So,now,talking with sue Carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just,dies.(this is the sad part,I guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes,or maybe not) But this book is definitely good,I recommend it with all my "Psychic" powers. Enjoy.............This review was written by Nigel.... 
I began this book with a healthy dose of skepticism. On more than one occasion I've been involved in "consensus" decision-making processes that were less than stellar. (As an employee, a board member, a community member and business owner.) In the hands of an unskilled, or manipulative, or misguided (or worse, downright deceitful) facilitator a so-called consensus decision-making process can leave you feeling like your pocket has been picked. You know exactly what I mean. When you finish the "process" and feel like you've been hoodwinked into agreeing to something because: - You didn't fully understand the scope of the issue you are supposed to be dealing with. - People with important information about the issue weren't in the room. - A manager who is worried about his ox getting gored has set the whole thing up to "share the blame" for some no-win problem he doesn't know how to solve. - You could never get a word in edgewise after your first stated concern stamped you as "not a team player." - And it was clear the boss wasn't going to go along with the decision the group made anyway! Well, the author not only educated me about what real consensus looks like, I feel like I've been inoculated against the toxic variety. The book, as mentioned in another review, is lean and mean. But there is plenty of substance to chew on, including: - A useful comparison of different decision making methods, along with their strengths and weaknesses. - A clear explanation of the considerable power of a consensus process. (Not the least of which is accelerated implementation of a decision.) - Succinct guidelines on how to start a consensus meeting off on the right foot. - Clear suggestions on how a multi-stage consensus process can be organized. - Specific strategies for dealing with people who engage in unproductive behavior. You know them as obstructionists, grandstanders, and those who sit silently waiting to strike with critical comments just when it seems the group is making progress. Perhaps the greatest value I found in this book is that it will steer me away from making the same mistakes I have seen other well-intentioned decision facilitators make time and again. Like not paying attention to simple and obvious things such as laying down ground rules for how people will communicate as they work toward a consensus. The author even puts words in your mouth by giving you on-point language to use just for this and other such occasions you will encounter while leading or participating in a consensus process. The information is so accessible and useful beyond the topic of consensus that I have no doubt that I will wear this book out in no time. The pages are already dog-eared and the spine is creased. Thankfully I haven't dropped it in the tub yet 
For anyone convening a meeting - this is the perfect book to read in preparation. Great reminders and insights on how to create a safe place for inquiry and creativity as well as thoughtful decisions. I found tips on ways to prevent and intervene when challenges to consensus arise particularly useful. I love how it is organized and it is the perfect size for 2 hour airplane trips 
Working in and with groups and, at the same time, making progress can be an incredibly complex experience. This book, though it demands a disciplined and thoughtful effort, will make a profound difference by its use. Having seen the principles of this work in action, groups are healthier and far more productive toward their charter. Members discover the patience to listen and the courage to contribute to others; results that make choosing this path quite worthy. 
First, compliments to Dressler for successfully resisting the temptation to unnecessarily 'inflate' the size of this book. As a result, Consensus through Conversation is digestible during a reasonable length plane flight. What makes it worthwhile to read on your NEXT plane trip is this: unlike many authors who are intellectually sound but lack "on the ground" skills, Dressler is different. He knows how to bring about sustainable improvement in organizational productivity. Even better, he knows how to TEACH others to do the same. That's what this book does--illustrates WHY real conversation is essential to affect lasting change. And then, takes us from ivory tower to ground level by producing a tool box of diagrams, tips, do's don'ts, and straight talk. If every author packed this much value into 77 pages, we would all spend more time IMPROVING our organizations than reading about it. Thanks for raising the bar, Larry. 
As a medical practice administrator, I found the approach described in Dressler's book as practical and an approach I intend to use for a tough decision I am struggling with, and wondering not just "what's the answer", but "how do we decide between a number of less than ideal choices with big impacts - - and are we exploring the full universe of options?". I am excited about implementing Dressler's approach; I believe its clarity and inclusiveness will not only produce a high quality decision, but will generate benefits well beyond the decision itself. 
There are going to be other reviewers who can provide more erudite reviews-- reviews better grounded in the study of cities or economic history. I am nothing more than an average reader who enjoys non-fiction. First of all, potential readers should be aware that this is an econonomic history. It follows flows of goods and capital rather than following the lives and careers of the men and women of Chicago. I knew what to expect, but for people looking for a more standard history of Chicago this may make Nature's Metropolis difficult to engage. I really enjoyed reading the book. It stretched my understanding of the economic growth of cities and raised issues that I had not considered about the role of the city *in* nature (not as opposed to nature). The examination of elements that made Chicago into both a city and The City was fascinating. The chapters tracing grain, lumber and meat as goods were clearly written and underscored the central theses. I guess it goes without saying that Nature's Metropolis is far from a light read, but that does not make it less rewarding. As someone who does not have a background in history, I only longingly wished that the bibliography had been annotated to help support further reading. 
This is a very distinctive, well researched and argued book about how Chicago developed. Starting with a standard model of Urban Economics - the von Thunen model of central place theory- the author quickly moves beyond it. The distinctive contribution of his book is Cronon's emphasis on how the roots of Chicago's remarkable development lay in the "soil" of its surrounding hinterlands. He carries this argument further by examining how the transportation and communication revolutions of the 19th century - the railroad and the telegraph - created unique advanatages for Chicago relative to other competitive metropolitan areas (such as St. Louis, Cincinnati, Milwaukee) and finally, how in turn, new metropolitan areas (such as KC, Omaha) arose to steal aways Chicago's dominance. As other reviewers have noted, the book offers really fascinating, detailed discussions and original research on - for example - the grain and lumber industries as well as capital flows in the midwestern US creatively using court records on corporate failures to track the flow of investments. This books contains a rich lode of intellectual wealth and it is well worth the effort to mine it. 
If you prefer your history to be the story of human beings, their struggles, and their triumphs, this book will disappoint. Cronon presents the history of Chicago and the midwest as the history of commodities and trade. It's an interesting approach, and he shows the global implications of many of his insights-- he correctly observes that much of what he demonstrates with Chicago could also be shown with other cities as well. Some of his insights didn't strike me as being nearly as unexpected as he seems to think they are (the interdependence on commodities wholesalers and their markets, for example), but most of his ideas are well-argued and supported. Ultimately this is not so much about Chicago's history as it is about using Chicago and the west as a case study to show how cities grow, and how city and country are inter-related 
Grain, beef, and lumber. Chicago became what it became not only because of its location on the Great Lakes/railroad sytem, but also because of these resources. This book shows how much nature influences human efforts. It has few personalities because the exploitation of the resources was inevitable. This is a great book for a greater understanding of how nature drives humanity 
As a professional educator, it's always great to review and reread the works of the great theorists such as Piaget. I consider him to be the father of educational psychology as well as a a great cognitive theorist 
Our school just started a school-wide newspaper this year. We joined NESPA and ordered The Reporter's Notebook for all 20 of our newspaper staff members. It has been an excellent tool for the students to use for ideas, editing, etc! As newspaper sponsor, I appreciated the usefulness of this book so much, I have ordered 20 copies for next year's staff as well 
We started a newspaper at our school, Resurrection St. Paul, in Ellicott City, MD this past year. Mark has been so helpful in giving us pointers to get the paper off the ground. The kids were so excited about having their own copy of "The Reporter's Notebook." It did make them feel like real journalists and gave them direction and ideas. I recommend it to members of any school newspaper 
The "Reporter's notebook" is a great tool to provide to students planning on writing and publishing a newspaper. The notebook provides several tips and ideas for young writers in a well organized format. There are also several pages for students to use for note taking. 
I use "The Reporter's Notebook" with the children in our elementary school newspaper club. It is an excellent tool to teach the kids how to create great artciles for the newspaper. We used the Intervew section as a guide when we interveiwed teachers in the school. I highly recommend the book! The children use the book as reference tool, even in the Middle School 
I bought these for our staff on our elementary school newspaper. The kids not only felt like real reporters with these.....the notebooks helped to keep the student reporters more organized and gave them guidance for writing their stories. The Reporters Notebook was a worthwhile investment for the staff and I will buy more next school year. 
Pages 38 to 97 -- half the book -- is just blank space for notes, which you could just as well write in a 10-cent, 70-page notebook spiral. The beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms, with some bulletted questions here and there 
Mark Levin's notebook for journalism students proves itself an invaluable tool in journalism and media courses. Aside from pages of information to record sources, story ideas, and more, hints and tips are scattered throughout the spiral bound book. This book is a must for any journalism student, or anyone simply interested in writing news stories 
This calendar features some of Alex Ross's best paintings and action figures, from January to December there is a year full of heros 
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans. 
To call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the Genius Alex Ross is not presented in chronological order, but rather starts with the most popular characters Superman, Batman, etc., and then moves on to other work such as Justice League of America, Kingdom Come, Alan Moore, etc. Alex Ross is arguably the greatest visual artist of our time. As far as I am concerned his work is up there with Picasso, Da Vinci and Degas. This book takes the reader in a character-and event-based journey of Alex Ross's incredible work. What Ross and this book have in common are the incredible attention to detail and color. The art presented in this book is so rich in color it is almost unreal. The pictures carry unbelievable detail, down to the pores on the faces of the Superman and Batman sculptures. I have never seen such a visual fest in any other comic or movie-related book, I guarantee you you will not be disappointed, it doesn't even matter whether you are a comic book fan or not. Ross's modern day interpretation in the recreation of the art work from 40s, 50s and 60s comic book covers is so nostalgic and professional it makes you appreciate his talent even more. This is one book not to miss. The print quality is extremely high, and pictures carry a ridiculous amount of detail and color. Especially if you are a Superman or Batman fan, you are on for a treat as they are most prominently featured in this book. This is one great book, I have always been a huge Alex Ross fan, but thanks to this book I now feel like I know him personally (through his art presented in this book as well as the narration in the text that accompanies the pictures). One last note: Get the hardcover if you can, the art work on the sleeve is much better than the paperback cover, and the art work on the front and back of the hard cover book is simply incredible 
DC comics fans who love comic art collections must have MYTHOLOGY: THE DC COMICS ART OF ALEX ROSS: it's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters Ross' art brought to life over the decades, from Superman and Flash to Green Lantern. Included also is Ross' new comic book series Justice, new sketches, and an oversized coffee-table format which helps display and profile, in full color, Ross' entire line of DC Comics superheroes. An original Superman and Batman story written by graphic designer Chip Kidd, a re-telling of Robin's origin written by Paul Dini, plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover MYTHOLOGY appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own. 
got it as a present for my boyfriend. he loved it. really nice cover that folds out 
I couldn't believe, but mr.Ross did it again!Even better!The second edition of the hardcover edition is even better than the first one! The cover is already a gem! You have to see to believe it!Not to mention the extra amount of pages of new art and updated material!Go for it!AAA+++ 
This is the perfect gift for the comic book fan who has every comic book. Also, looks great on a coffee table 
This book was so impressive we were glad we bought it for our friend! She loves it, and didn't put it down all day after receiving it 
More an inside in Ross' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters... beautiful boo 
This book will astonish you even before you open it. The jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of DC, Superman and Batman, and below the jacket you'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every DC superhero battling versus their respective villains. With an introduction from M Night Shyamalan, the book presents Alex from his early beginnings as a child trying to create comic book characters and how his mother kind of influenced him (even though he affirms this didn't happen, take a look at her mom's works and try to believe him) He then presents the DC characters one by one (the Batman session has some pages dedicated to the Joker only, no other villains are shown), the early drawings, original artwork from classics and the homage he has paid for covers, posters or special editions. Analysis on the symbols and the myths of each character are used to describe what Ross wants to project with his images. I don't think it necessary to mention which character has the larger amount of pages dedicated to himself only. You get to see in drawings the creative process he follows when creating a piece, the ideas scratched on a piece of paper, the drawings and possible posing and then the final image. There are pictures I has never seen until I got this book, when I first saw them my fisrt thought was ` I need to frame these', which came up as a bad idea as I would have had to frame the entire book. The abandoned ideas for `Portraits of villainy' are presented here in the form of pencil sketches that look pretty well, it is hard to imagine how they would have looked if the project had been completed. His takes on Hanna-Barbera, Mad magazine, Alan Moore, the animated style and World's finest are also present. Then there are pages and pages dedicated to 'Kingdom Come', from the early concepts and ideas, passing through sketches until the realization of the project. The possible prequel that never occurred, `The Kingdom' is also mentioned and the preliminary sketches by Ross are shown. Uncle Sam is also analyzed near the end of the book in the same way the other projects previously were. Then we have this section called `The process', in which we obviously get to see how Alex works using the book's cover as example. The final part of the book is a very nice bonus, a Batman/Superman special story written by Chip Kidd and Alex Ross created exclusively for this book. Indeed a great piece of collection, this book is a must for comic book fans. The hard cover presentation, the paper in which it is printed and the bonus stuff are worth the price to pay. 
This book shows there could be millions of minorities living in a stagnant way of life, where they're not able to achieve or dream of the so called American dream. I loved this book, I felt this book, this book is important and it should be read by anybody that cares for those living a life that's unimaginable to many of us. Through everything Lafayette and Pharaoh were still children, I felt a lot of hope in this book. Through it all there was some kind of peace. This is my favorite book from Alex, I've read his other book The Other Side of the River and There Are No Children Here is his absolute best 
One of the best books that I read this year. "There Are No Children Here" is about two brothers try to fit into there world. These two brothers are deciding who they are. The two brothers are Lafeyette and his younger brother Pharoah. This book takes place in the Chicago projects. At the Henry Horner Homes. Everyday these boys only see violence. They see drugs, gangs, and murder. Lafeyette and Pharoah mother LaJoe talks to a report who is a writer for magazines. The report ask LaJoe "Can I talk to the children here" she says "There no children here" As Lafeyette and Pharoah grow up they only have a mom. So Lafeyette is a father figure to his younger brother Pharoah. As Lafeyette goes to his teen years he starts to hang with gang members and goes to jail a few times. Is Lafeyette a good father figure for is brother? Pharoah the younger brother is very dedicated young man he will always put a 100% in no matter what. He will never give up. What will happen to these two brother while grow up in the Chicago projects? Will they hang with Gangs and do drugs or will they try to make it out of the Projects and be someone. While read this book you feel like you are in the story, you feel like you are the report write everything. You could really see this really happen. I enjoy this book because it talks about the real world that we do not see ever day 
There Are No Children Here This book is about two young boys trying to get passed the ghetto, and harsh life. The two boys are Lafayette and Pharaoh. They live in the Henry Horner projects. They are trying to get passed the everyday violence, hatred, and crimes that go down in the projects. They would do anything to have what other people have like a nice, clean home, some good clothes, a car for the family, and a good education. These boys don't have these things along with several other children living in the ghetto. They struggle so much to succeed in life. In the book they go through a lot of bad times and hardly any good ones. They support each other and they won't let each other fail without trying at first. It is not often that they have positive attitudes. Most of what they do and think is negative. Their behavior comes form their surroundings. Maybe if their surroundings were a little more decent, they would turn out better in live. I would recommend this book to people who have what these children don't so they can realize that they shouldn't take things for granted. I would give "There Are No Children Here" four stars out of five. 
As referenced in the preface, according to the Children's Defense Fund, one in every three children lives in poverty in the city of Chicago- a remarkably higher rate than the rest of the country. Alex Kotlowitz's national bestseller "There Are No Children Here" depicts the poignant and powerful story of two brothers, Lafeyette and Pharoah, growing up in one of Chicago's most notorious public housing projects, the Henry Horner Homes. Although this is a story of hardship and tragedy, it is also a story of courage, hope and love. Kotlowitz chronicles the lives of Pharoah and Lafeyette as they confront racism and violence in their own community. This extraordinary story exposes the fact that two parallel worlds still persist in this county and how Inner-city America continues to be defined by poverty and violence and is maintained by institutionalized racism and social inequalities. This story is at times difficult to read because for Lafeyette and Pharoah, violence is a part of their daily lives. They witness death, shootings, drugs, the incarceration of their older brother, their mother's struggle to provide for her family and the influence of gangs at an early age- certainly more hardship and tragedy than many adults will face in a lifetime. However, they confront these realities with courage and profound insight beyond their years. The only negative aspect of the book is that Kotlowitz does not chronicle the educational experience of both boys adequately. We are given a brief glimpse into the quality of education that Pharoah receives and his academic hardships and successes, however, we are left with little to no information about Lafeyette's experience in school. Education is fundamental to the future success of children in poor, urban communities and it would have enhanced the story to have more insight into the quality of education that the two brothers received in order to gain a more comprehensive perspective of the inequities that exist in low income, urban communities. When Kotlowitz first proposed writing a book about the lives of Lafeyette and Pharoah to chronicle the experiences of children growing up in urban poverty, their mother, LaJoe, remarked "But you know, there are no children here. They've seen too much to be children" (1). Despite their struggle to survive, we are reminded that they still are children tying to determine who they are and what their place is in the world around them. 
My God, who has no feeling for these very unfortunate people are heartless ba*****s.American society flushes their poor and disadvantaged people away in the gutter. The gap between the poor and wealthy is increasing all the time and something has to give. Great book and should be required reading for high school seniors 
I would highly recommend this book to anyone. The author provides insight into the lives of two inner city youth. It makes you question our society and what we can do to help individuals who live in poverty. Poverty is not a choice but rather a sad reality that effects far too many of America's youth. Please read this book! It will change the way you think 
To hardcore conservatives who believe that the plight of the poor is no one's fault but their own, I say: Read this book. To hardcore liberals who believe the poor are oppressed by society and not responsible for their situation, I say: Read this book. "There are No Children Here" shows that life is more complicated than either extreme. The lives of the people in this book are governed by complex interactions of both personal choices and unavoidable bad luck. The author sympathetically examines the terrible hardships his subjects were born into, but never shies away from showing how their situation is perpetuated by the harmful behavior and relationships they choose to pursue. Whatever your ideology is going in, you will not look at poverty the same way after reading this book 
I think that the 'reader's' comments below about Thomas Sowell were helpful and I just wanted to add one more thing... Most of the negative reviews about this book are people who are angry at Phaorah and Lafayett's mother, LaJoe. They claim that LaJoe is stealing from the government and blah blah blah. The problem is that LaJoe's story is NOT the authorial intent of the book - the subtitle of the book clearly states this: "The Story of TWO BOYS Growing Up in The Other America..." not "The Story of LaJoe Raising Kids in The Other America." When reading this book, bear in mind that the book is looking at the two main characters who are born into a situation that they cannot help - is it their fault that their parents never got married, or that they get government money, etc? Hardly! People who get angry at the LaJoe and consequently miss the point of this book are like people who would get upset if you were trying to describe an apple and they want to talk about a pear. Concentrate on the lives of the children in this story to see what the book is really trying to say. Having lived in two different boroughs and four different neighborhoods in New York City has opened my eyes even wider to 'The Other America' that so much of the rest of America couldn't care less about. Kotlowitz's book is a good start to understanding this oft forgotten group of people. 
This book takes you through so many different emotions. Kotlowitz does an amazing job weaving this documentary novel together. It opens the eyes of suburban America. This book inspired me to teach in the inner-cities. A must-read for anyone going into teaching, public service...anyone with an interest in the social fabric of disadvantaged America 
What a joy it was to read this book, and another of Fischer's books; Paul Revere's Ride. Written in narrative storytelling fashion, the book moves briskly--but with urgency. I will save the long reviews for the top 500 writers here at Amazon, but I found this book to be extremely satisfying. What's more, not only does Fischer illuminate Washington's determination to keep the idea of liberty alive, he also writes about the tremendous help given the Continental Army by locals who continued to harass the British throughout the winter as British foraging parties searched for food for themselves and their horses. 
David Hackett Fisher's "Washington's Crossing" is a wonderfully written and research history of this seminal event in American history. I was admittedly hesitant to read this work, Pulitzer Prize and all, as I felt the topic a bit narrow for my tastes and it perhaps a bit too much like a high school history lesson. Luckily, I was very mistaken. Perhaps the author put it best. "There is an old American folk tale about George Washington and the Crossing of the Delaware. It tells us that the new American republics nearly failed in the winter of 1776, that George Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas night, and that his victory at Trenton revived the Revolution. All of this story is true, but that in not the whole truth. There was more to it." The "more to it" is captured in the pages of the book and followed by footnotes and various appendices that accound for 168 pages, many of which are well worth reading within of themselves. Fisher accomplished so much in this volume that the lavish praise many have written is richly deserved. His ability to put into context a very rough 1776 with the Crossing and ensueing battles was simply superb. Fischer and James McPherson are editors of this series, published by the Oxford University Press, Pivotal Moments in American History. James McPherson, a wonderfully accomplished historian and contribtor to another series by the same publisher, The Oxford History of the United States (with Battle Cry of Freedom) will most assuredly oversee works of very high caliber. I look forward to reading many more of them, with James T. Patterson at the top of my list with his contribution to this series on Brown v. the Board of Education. Lastly I would add that my interest in history rarely includes an appetite for military history. That said, Fischer does a great job in covering a largely military operation while keeping the interest of students of history who might not otherwise be inclined for the level of research and written detail. 
I eyed Washington's Crossing for a long time before finally purchasing it. Meanwhile in the past couple of years I read Ellis' "His Excellency, George Washington," and McCullough's "John Adams" and "1776." Although I am by no means finished reading about the period and its individuals, I have gotten a wonderful education in the lives and times of this era. All of these books complement each other and Washington's Crossing is the crowning piece that ties much of it together. Washington's Crossing is very pro-American and pays homage to Washington as a great man and leader. Revisionist and alternative views of the making of our nation do not have a place here. Instead, the author focuses on the best ideals that made the United States great such as respect for individuals of all stations, a willingness to listen to the views of others, flexibility and perseverance in adversity and changing situations, the placing of the good of the nation ahead of one's advancement and glory, and decency on the field of war. As a historical record the book is outstanding and tells the story from both sides. The British are not a faceless and evil enemy, but a group of largely decent and capable people trying to do the right thing from their perspective. We Americans should regard ourselves as fortunate in having them as our "mother country" and the basis for our own institutions. The various battles and maneuvers of the New York and New Jersey campaigns are described in detail, but not in a minute, mind-numbing matter, and the result is fascinating history. Many maps are included that will aid the reader in understanding the action. The book contains many appendices that provide much added and incidental detail that the reader eager for more knowledge will enjoy. "Washington's Crossing" is a keeper for a lifetime and now sits on a bookshelf awaiting my return 
As a veteran of both the United States Army (field artillery) and militia (National Guard), Professor Fischer's story makes one proud to have served in the same army as George Washington and those brave men who tramped through the snow and freezing rain 
Fantastic, exciting true tale of one of the most well known legends in the history of this country - only, it's not a legend. Dr. Fischer goes to great and convincing lengths immediately in the book to make this point clear. I have no problem with revisionist history, as long as it brings to light the uncovered or supressed details of what we hold sacred as historical truth. This book is revisionist history in that fashion, and it reinforces the facts behind the legend. With his excellent reference list, and his ability to place the reader at the site of the drama of the events, this book is a believable and authentic narrative of what happened during this pivotal and desperate year in American history 
I'll start by saying that it took me only three days to read this book, cover to cover; I couldn't put it down! Exciting narrative, well researched, and a must read for everyone 
Part of the Oxford Pivotal Moments in American History series, Fischer's work is a cultural history surrounding the events that Washington's Revolutionary Army participated in from March of 1776 to March of 1777, with the middle of the book focusing on the pivotal turning point of the unlikely capture of the Hessian garrison in Trenton, New Jersey on Christmas of 1776, made famous by the painting featured on the cover of the book. Fischer's book was published at nearly the same time as McCullough's 1776, which covers nearly the indentical time period, yet unlike McCullough's focus on the narratives and characters of the of the dark days of the American cause in 1776, Fischer's work is a close examination of cultural trends and mores that developed and moved the American Army, unlike no other movement in the world at the time. In short, McCullough's book would be best enjoyed by those looking for a tree-top level of the events of the day. It is an excellent book that will be read for years, and Fischer is complementary of it, but Washington's Crossing is an in-depth look at why the American cause took the course it did and what precisely that means for us today. It is most certainly not history-as-pageant-on-parade. Most importantly, Washington's Crossing does a wonderful job of de-mythologizing the American cause to American readers, while reintroducing the concepts of rare and unique combinations of leadership and service that actors such as Washington, Knox, Monroe and down to the yeoman citizen-militia were in world history. Something new was happening along the banks of the Delaware that December, when it was most unlikely to 
In my quest to increase my understanding and knowledge of the American Revolution I came upon this book by Mr. Fischer. It was well recommended so I "took a chance". I hope all my future "gambles" in life turn out this good. Mr. Fischer takes the well known story of Washington Crossing the Delaware, one we all learned about in school, and tears apart everything you thought you knew- then rebuilds it into a thoroughly entertaining and fastinating series of historical events. He writes a wonderfully easy to read book- a page turner. He goes into depth without boring you to sleep or losing you in a myriad of facts and names. As for the actual text, I marvelled at the sheer luck that befell the Continental Army with the turn of the weather- it's no wonder they felt that "divine providence" was on their side. I was taken by the diametrically opposing stratagies and methods of the two prominent generals- Washington and Howe. And was engrossed by the descriptions of battles and the diversity of the conditions the British, Hessian, and American Armies were living under. The appendices are a treasure trove of information that should not be skipped- make sure you read them when you are finished the book. I'll never look at Emmanuel Leutze's painting the way same again 
I join the chorus of admirers of this wonderful history of the events leading up to and including the great battle. The crossing was indeed a pivotal, crucial moment in American history. It is no stretch of the truth to enumerate this as one of the 10 most important moments in our entire history. Although Washington deserves the credit for his extraordinary skill, nerve, and leadership, Fischer's re-telling is an amazing feat of fascinating, page-turning detail about the ordinary soldiers who overcame enormous obstacles to get to Trenton, much less to triumph over the shocked Hessians, and their valiant leader, who bravely succumbed to mortal injury. We cross the treacherous Delaware with the intrepid Americans, trek with them across the snows, hurrah with their surprise attack, and follow them on to further victory. Historian or lay person, this is a book you must read to learn of this "little skirmish" that eventually made America a world power. Fischer has done a masterful job. We come away just that much prouder to be descendants of these at once ordinary and extraordinary Americans 
This is just a tremendous piece of work. I've read a lot of focused revolutionary war items and to say that some are "readable" is a gross overstatement. This reads almost as well as a good novel. It also doesn't have too much about the NY campaigns or much beyond Trenton/Princeton. 
...especially young ones. I have now been a vegetarian for five years and rarely use this book any more but it was GREAT when I was first starting out. Lauren Butts was sixteen when she published this book and the recipes are all geared towards kids in that age group - both in simplicity and taste. When I bought this book it was getting a lot of buzz because it had just been published by such a young author. Judging by the date of the last review, I'm guessing it has fallen off the radar. I, however, would still recommend this book to any teenage vegetarian 
Though I am 23, older than the intended audience, my Mom bought me this book as a present. I was thrilled with it. Lauren Butts has created a fun and easy cookbook for anyone. I love the layout of the cookbook, it is divided into sections, and I enjoyed her nutritional info in the front of the book. Maybe it will inspire more teens to go veg.I found this cookbook full of great meatless recipes. I must warn strict vegetarians and vegans however, that most recipes contain dairy products, or eggs. There is a great recipe for "Nathan's Blueberry Breakfast Cupcakes", that is easy to make and tastes like store bought. However when I tried to get my three year old neighbor to eat one, he refused in horror. Other recipes that I have enjoyed making include: apricot chimichangas, Thai tofu Veggie Wrap-yum, Burrito Roll up, Veggie Pitas (Tastes the same as Wendy's veggie pita), Layered Nacho Salad, Mock Caesar Salad (in case you didn't know, Caesar Salad dressing is typically made with ANCHOVIES-fish=meat), Chilled Berry Soup-this is a fabulous recipe I made last summer when berries were plentiful, it is totally tasty and makes a great meal, TASTY FLATBREAD PIZZA WITH ARTICHOKE HEARTS!! This pizza was so unbelievably tasty, I have always been a bit wary of artichoke hearts, they just look kind of disgusting you know, but I was so shocked to discover their delicious taste!! Veggie Quesadillas were also fabulous. SPAGHETTI PIE is indeed a great dish, and I like to make it when serving non-vegetarians. It has been a hit with everyone so far. Tofu McNuggets are the absolute bomb. These recipes are only a fraction of the great ones in this book. I would highly recommend it to parents of new young vegetarians, or college students like myself who don't have that much time to cook. Some have opined that this book is full of recipes that are fattening, but I think most know, that us vegetarians are a mostly lean lot, and I can personally attest that the recipes aren't fattening. Thanks Lauren for creating a great book, it is indeed an oasis as far as Veg cookbooks go. Its great to have a cookbook that isn't full of really long, hard to find, expensive ingredients 
I personaly know the author of this wonderful book. I went to a camp with her that helps for college credits. She is very intelligent and I have tried the food in this book. It tastes really good. The book is well thought out, easy to read and perfectly set up for any teenage vegitarian. I gave a personal review before it was published, so I do recomend this book to any teenager that is willing to cook 
I must admit iv always been a Clinton fan. Especially for the part he played in the north of Ireland. I thought the book was well written and gave an interesting account of the good and bad sides of the American political system . The book gave a great incite into the man himself and what it takes to become president. Great read, highly recommend 
Bill Clinton writes a very interesting account of his life in an inviting conversational style. His story-telling approach easily draws the reader into the events of his life. I especially enjoyed the amount of time he spent discussing his childhood. He expresses the pain and isolation that he felt very well. He is a talented communicator and this comes through as he tells his story. The words flowed one after another and I was easily captivated by the details. This review actually refers to the audio CD unabridged version, Part I. However, after 21 CD's for Part I alone, I did become tired of all of the drawn-out explanations and wished I got the abridged version. Overall, it was a great book and I am going to also read Part 2. It provides insight and apology for the actions of our ex-president. He seems to have written it to make amends with those he offended 
Why did I decided to listen to an autobiography, I still don't know, autobiography's have never interested me before? However, Bill Clinton's autobiography, articulate and exceedingly detailed, was the exception. Aghast by Clinton's extraordinary memory, I found myself lured in by the minutia of his narrative; a perfect account of every name, date, and place since he was a kid! He has almost a photographic memory; a prerequisite of any Yale law graduate. Public opinion often casts presidents as idiots, when in fact they are some of the brightest minds in our country. To become a president takes a great deal of intellect, wisdom, charisma, will power, and luck. Marveled by Bill Clinton's brain power, I wished I was him. Bill Clinton leaves the reader inspired by his biography; motivating the reader to accomplish their own goals. An upbeat former president, Clinton is still a leader and motivational speaker. A must read for anyone who needs direction in their life. 
Well written, good book. Interesting to read his perspective on world events different from what I was seeing in the media 
President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries. It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added. It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
I read this book with some skepticism at first since the initial reviews from the pundits were lukewarm. But I must admit, it is a riveting account of late 20th century American politics, and what it takes to rise to the top. Clinton's narration comes across in a natural, easygoing style, and it surprised me how deeply he thinks and feels about things that really matter. Those looking for juicy tidbits and meaningless chatter will be disappointed. This is a serious account by Clinton, about his strengths, weaknesses, and most importantly, his capacity to forgive his enemies. His early childhood experiences, especially what he learnt from his grandfather, seem to have made a major positive impact in his life. This, and how non-racist his folks were even though they poor, southern folks from the 1920s era, armed him with that all-important Teflon coating needed in politics. Clinton's capacity to forgive is exceeded only by the public's willingness to forgive him. In his glaring personal weaknesses they recognized their own follies, and in his ability to overcome, they saw their inner hero. Clinton, in many respects, was a naked president. This nakedness comes across even in the narration, endearing readers to him and to see in his vulnerabilities an innocent and instant capacity for change. A second or third reading (if you have the time/patience!) brings out more of Clinton's emotional and political entrails. Some trends emerge. For example, Clinton would dream big, would start strong, win, self-sabotage, rally again, win big this time. No doubt this comes from his personality to seek adventure and to relish the pleasure of an impossible comeback. One of Clinton's stated dreams was to write a great book. This book too, has embarked on a similar journey. It started with great fanfare, bestseller, fizzled in the ratings, now beginning to rally. The years pass, I see even his ardent detractors mellowing.....it is possible that this book will finish the journey....it will rally, and win big. In all seriousness, this is an excellent read 
The CD version of My Life is the perfect companion for a long road trip. Several reviewers have observed that the 900 page book is too long, but the abridged CD version cuts some of the detail and covers the major events of his life in six hours. While listening to Clinton's smooth southern accent I felt like I was sitting on a porch in Georgia listening to a fascinating person recount the highlights of his life and what he has learned from them. Highly recommended 
I never appreciated this man while he was President or victim of a scandal from his own weakness! Yet after reading FrKurt Messick's excellent review, I gained valued insights into the inner life struggles of Bill Clinton. After a few Chapters into his years as Governor of Arkansas, he solidly attributes his salvation to his Wife and Family. I doubt that he can justly objectify his personal status when he endeavors to separate his constant external and internal struggles! He places his personal struggles alongside the weakness of his Brother Roger at the feet of dysfunctional Fathers. As I came to the time of his becoming President, the battery-powered CD Player kept me in the dark about Monica Molinski! That part will wait till I can buy the book...I am closer to becoming an admirer of his position in History as our bright and gifted President, a good Parent and an equally good partner for his brilliant teammate, Hillary Clinton! Far more cheerfuly and gratefully, Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood 
When Fernand Braudel originally published this text in the sixties, he became a pariah at the Sorbonne. In retrospect that disapprobation was the kind of seal of approval that "banned in Boston" came to embody. Previous histories drilled deep into one facet of history. Braudel's was a pioneering effort in multidisciplinary historical analysis. It captures the historical flow that evolves civilizations, sacrificing only the detail outside the themes. Even subsequent to "A History of Civilizations," other historians have been unable to write a thematic survey that matches this original. And don't be tempted to skip the "soft" introductory chapters with titles like "The Study of Civilization Involves All the Social Sciences," and "The Continuity of Civilizations." These tee up the hard topics, like "The Greatness and Decline of Islam." There's method in Braudel's approach, and it takes patience. Braudel's translator, Richard Mayne had his job cut out for him. The complex syntax is that of a French intellectual of the sixties, and it is retained in Mayne's text, but you become accustomed to it. Don't look for maps or photographs in this Penguin Paperback; the text alone is six hundred pages. There's only one other book in this space, "From Dawn to Decadence," by Jacques Barzun. In my view they are complementary 
Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been "founded by whites from the North". Fact is, there were no "whites" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race "browns". 
I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. "A History of Civilizations" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book. Instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events, Fernand Braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography, history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization. A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the `deep end' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader. If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a `time capsule' of facts then. 
If you want a better understanding of how the world has come to be what it today is, then this book is a good first step in so doing. Braudel was an influential French historian specializing in the Mediterranean, so his insights into the evolution of Europe are more insightful than other regions he highlights (but he is insightful throughout). Excellent book to read while you bask in the sun with your feet dancing in Lake Michigan on a tourist beach (as I did). Maybe the atmosphere I had while reading made me enjoy it more; nonetheless, one should read this if they have any desire to 
This book is extraordinary! Meant for French lycens in their last year before sitting for their bac exam, it was a failure. However, looking at today's situation of the west vis--vis the Islamic and other non-western worlds, it is a jewel. Among other things, it explains the origin of today's conflicting attitudes. For example, why the Egyptians and other Mediterranean peoples become in overwhelming majority Moslems several centuries after the conquest by the Arabs 
Man, you can't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied. I liked the way they presented the idea of BW, but it was seriously outdated. They should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year 
Anybody buying this book to learn some BW will be very much disappointed. Like the way the book is organised but older stuff. I can't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book. Not only they should stop selling, also should recall the book 
This book is great since all the step by step instruction is accurate. This book is for SAP consultants who have little knowledge of SAP-BW concepts and would like become a SAP-BW expert. The only thing that I saw lacking is for Business Explorer query options. There are very few examples for Business Explorer. But however, I think if you play with the GUI this problem is overcome easily. THIS BOOK IS WORTH IT !! 
As title suggests this book is step by step guide. I think author has assumed you already have knowledge of SAP BW concepts. It walks you through steps on how to create infocubes, load data and create queries and workbooks. Its EXTREMELY useful for people who are thinking to self-train themseleves in BW area . NOT meant for expereince BW people .. 
Secured Packaging. Prompt. I would do business with them again 
In the introduction the authors tell us that the purpose of the book is to provide snapshots of daily life. If you have ever been to Italy you know that they have a different notion of what it means to live. Every visit that I have every made to Italy there has been a general strike that has taken place. The first time I visited Italy this fact mystified me. Now, I just know that this is what happens and I don't let it bother me. This book is a collection of short discussion on a variety of topics. The topics covered are as follows: 1. April Fool's Day 2. At the table 3. Attracting Attention 4. Bad Luck Day 5. Il Bar 6. Le barzellette (joke) 7. Basic Expressions in Italian 8. La Befana 9. Business 10. Calcio (Soccer) 11. Calendar 12. Calling Cards 13. Il campanilismo 14. Il carnevale 15. Celebrations and holidays 16. Compliments, appreciation, and criticism 17. Dating and Marriage 18. Driving in Italy 19. Education 20. Expressions such as Dio mio! 21. Eye contact in conversation 22. Family and friends 23. Il Ferragosto 24. Form of government and politics 25. Gallantry 26. Gestures 27. Houses and housing 28. Introductions 29. Italian films 30. Italy on wheels 31. The kitchen 32. The language 33. Letters 34. Made in Italy 35. Ma lei non sa chi sono io! (You don't know who I am) 36. Il malocchio (evil eye) 37. M'arrangio 38. Meals and mealtimes 39. Monetary unit - the lira (this is now out of date) 40. Navigating a building 41.

Ways of conveying information 70. We make love, not war 71. The wines of Italy 72. Women 73. Work 74. The world of youth The sections that speak of male and female interaction are very valuable for women traveling to Italy alone. Italians are very expressive people. They are much more demonstrative than Americans. This book covers that fact in great detail, and does a nice job of getting the point across. Physical beauty is greatly prized in Italy, and this will result in more than a few pinches when you are a woman in Italy unaccompanied. Overall, I think this is useful little book to read before leaving for your first trip to Italy. It won't make a lot of sense before you arrive in Italy. However, once you are there much of it will become clear. 
This slender volume reads fast. A comprehensive study of Italian culture is beyond the scope of this book. The authors have arranged 74 brief "points" about daily life in Italy, alphabetically by subject, so the reader doesn't know what is coming next. If you look at the sample pages available here, you will get a sense of the leaps: we begin with an explanation of the Italian version of April Fool's Day, followed by four paragraphs on table manners, and then we're on to "attracting attention," and so on. From the very way it's organized, we are clearly in the realm of entertainment, although the information is accurate and certainly useful. There is a dusting of vocabulary, but it's not a course in Italian for travellers. I found it a delightful and fascinating read 
This book offers true, informative facts about Italy and the Italian lifestyle in an easy to read format. It's a great read for anyone planning a trip to Italy or for anyone simply interested in this magnificent country 
I am a international student. For understanding and using english naturely, I have read a lot of "Grammar books." So far, my all of english abilities:speaking, writing, reading, and grammar are not good. This book is really helpful. I recommend to many international student! 
I have used this outstanding book with international students for several years, but it would be helpful if the Answer Key were available from Amazon. 
With this book is it possible to learn the english grammar. I'm from Germany and my school time is far away. This book help rearly to learn and understand. 
I definitely wouldn't change these workbooks (A and B) for other Advanced English Grammar Workbooks. If you want to master Grammar in order to top a TOEFL or TESL exam, I really recommend it. The examples are extremely easy to follow. The only problem is that I prefer a one-workbook system. Anyway, my five stars go to Betty Azar's Grammar Book 
I didn't know that this grammar book is composed of volume A and Volume B. After I recieved this book, I realized that. But I guess there is combinated one. Also, you can buy combination with work book less than regular price. Be careful, when you buy this book, make sure if you need just Volume B 
It is not only my favorite book but also my index ,because i just study one year by myself of this book and i've got very good skills especially in grammar .So i'll recommend anyone who likes to learn enlish fast to choose this book.So just look at it one time and i'm sure you'll like it ,blieve me! 
Pranab Chatterjee wisely cautions us to remember that there are ways of expressing nationalism that differ from the Western models. With examples from literature and history the author helps us explore the "inner" spiritual or cultural world of Bengalis in colonial India, a world they tried to keep safe and distinct from the "outer" world of British-imposed politics. The writing in places is a bit vague, but the reading is worth the effort to remind us that wisdom does not begin and end in the West 
Even though L.M. Montgomery did not intend Anne of Green Gables to be a series, she still captivates with her eager readers in Anne of Avonlea. There are still quite a few differences, Anne has grown from a "queer", fiery, young girl to a wiser, calmer, auburn-headed schoolteacher. Yes, a schoolteacher. Also, as we follow Anne in this Bildungsroman literature, the romance between her and Gilbert Blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel. Some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first, and perhaps this is because Anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude. Altogether, my opinion of the book is that it was a good follow-up and I sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as Anne of Green Gables. 
How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction. I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books. At least the movies keep your interest 
Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all. The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series. My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them. Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time. This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues. I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly. 
Red haired with a flaming temper, the phenomenal Anne Shirley is back in her 2nd book! Marilla, a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing Anne up (when she was an orphan) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins, Davy and Dora Keith. Anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble. Davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes: like making his sister Dora walk the pig fence! Davy??s idea of fun includes violence and humor ?V but only for himself. The girls have to teach Davy manners, which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy. Anne??s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again, but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world. At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her ??Sweet Teacher??. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair ??carrots??) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn??t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger. My mom keeps telling me to go and do work but I cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written. I like the others in this series also.Thank you L.M. Montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life!~~ Referring to the special collectors editio 
I love this story. Echo lodge was great. It was about the last book where Anne is in Avonlea and a little girl. Very excellent book 
This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables. It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college. Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad. It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first). Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change). For anyone who liked the first book, this is sure to not disappoint 
It never ends, luckily!!! I will never tire of Anne's wonderful, lively imagination. In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles! Anyways, more happens in this story than a change in appearance: Anne becomes the Avonlea schoolma'am, and loves her students like crazy, especially little Paul Irving, who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher. Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT 
Anne of Avonlea was almost as good as the first Anne book. It is about Anne's life as a school teacher in Avonlea. Marilla adopts two mischievous twins and Mrs. Rachel Lynde moves in. So life is never dull for Anne at the school house or at Green Gables. You could read it on its own, but I recommend you read Anne of Green Gables first 
I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. Now I'm 21 and recendly read it again, and I liked it even more. The plot is great. The characters are alive, and the writing is superb.A must for anyone that wants to laugh, love and cry with the town from Avonlea 
I stayed up all night reading this book, not only because the info was so good but it is extremely humorous and entertaining. I recommend this book to anyone who cares about their dog 
I bought this book as a last resort on how to deal with my GSD/Malamute. She was a horrible mannered thing..lol. Now she is better behaved and minds. Three HUGE cheers to Joy Tiz for her awesome book and understanding of what makes a dog tick!!!! I also keep on on her websites for more info as I go along..going to write another book Joy 
Joy actually understands dogs and temperment. I can not believe how many books I have read that were written by people who didn't have the slightest clue what made dogs tick 
I bought this book eventhough I own the dvd because the movie was fantastic and absolutly hilarious. Bridget Jones's Diary (the book) is equally as funny, it differs slightly from the movie but not too much, this works well because it adds new scenes and information into the story and life of Bridget Jones. It's a very well written, quick read that will remain on my bookshelf for a very long time. I recommend it to all 
There was a lot of hype surrounding this book, with the movie and all, and after reading, I have to say, I fell in love with it! Ms. Jones is the perfect chick lit heroine and she made me laugh so many times! A book that is this good is a rare treat, so don't pass it up if you haven't read it yet! Along with it, I also recommend "Heartbreaker" by Kim Corum, another good chick lit book 
If you haven't read this book-- it's a must-- it's a classic early version of Chick Flick. This is an outrageously funny book and yet sincere in it's look at the inside view of a gal with a few extra lbs and being single in the 90's. Still a national best seller. It is so much fun for anyone who tries to lose weight or is on a diet (isn't that all of us) in the course of the book she loses 72 lbs and gains 74 -- hilarious or is it? A droll sense of humor, a strong emphasis on how we look and how we relate to men-- will give any female reader much to think about and chuckle about too. Do you want to lose 7 lbs, stop smoking and develop inner poise-- well see how Bridget does or doesn't do all of that in Bridget Jones diary.Fast summer read-- great airplane reading, fun reading for a mom who has to read in short breaks between kids, food, family and chaos! Good re-reading too....keep it at the summer house for guest 
This book is funny. No one can doubt that. The reader can truely feel the joy, the sadness, the hope, the loss, the success and the failure that Bridget Jones feels from page to page. The movie is, indeed, hilarious, and to some extent better than the book. Do not expect flowery writing styles like that of Maya Angelou. Expect a more simplified style, such as that of Meg Cabbot (although more 'adult,' as it were, intelligent and thought/emotion-provoking) Expect a good page-turner, which keeps you rooting for the character to find the perfect sex-God who will love all fluxuating 131 lbs of her and keep her mother quiet all at the same time. Most greatly, however, you wish nothing less than for her to be happy with the Bridget Jones that you will grow to love. Most certainly reccomend. Good summer- or plane-ride-rea 
All women have their problems, but for Bridget Jones, with her seemingly permanent single life, for which all of her married acquaintances obsessively harass her about, her habit of drinking a little too much, and her trouble with her weight, which seems to mysteriously rocket up and down, the poor thing just can't seem to catch a break.  An instantly lovable character, Bridget is real, and her complaints about life and men are often hilarious and believable. Her conversations with her friends are also extremely enjoyable as they dish and grumble about all the things that men do wrong, which, you know, are quite a lot. Often her musings and thoughts, the "What's wrong with me," and her compulsively-fixated dieting and attempts at positive reinforcement, are very entertaining.  Very funny book that is different in several ways from the movie; so if you have seen the movie, try the book (books). 
I rarely like a movie better than the book but it seems that sometimes a director knows when to cut out unfavorable aspects better than a book editor. This was still a very good book and I highly recommend it. 
After seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book. This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today. Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading. That takes talent, in my book. In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics). You cant help but root for Bridget. I recommend this book and its sequel. Most everyone will get a good laugh out of it 
Go buy this book. You'll read it over and over - and laugh every single time. Bridget Jones is my hero. She tries so hard to be perfect... but poor thing, she is like the rest of us - woefully insecure and less than perfect. Almost everyone has seen the movie which was excellent, but the book is twice as good. If you love romantic comedies, you'll love Bridget Jones 
In this short work by Manly Hall, he digresses into the little known subject of how the ancient masters of the mystery schools go about teaching their students. Much has changed in the way of secret societies since the days of Plato and Pythagoras, however, the principles are generally the same. Silence is still of utmost importance. In the times of Pythagoras, silence was not only a virtue, but something your life depended upon. Today, you will not get crucified or burned at the stake for revealing secrets from a society, however, your integrity and Will are disseminated. Silence today stands as a virtue more than anything, but one that most people neglect. This short book also looks into the practices of the Student, Disciple and Initiate, as the basic three grades of the practitioner once they have entered a mystery school. Even today all of these attitudes that Hall speaks about have complete practicality in today's culture. It is less about environment and more about the demeanor of the practitioner. If one does not take in all of the ideas represented in this book, surely one or two of them will cling to the readers mind as not only possible, but inspirational. For those that have been practicing the secret arts for a period of time, this book may serve as a good reminder of why they are doing what they do to begin with 
This is a pretty exceptional book. There are three major strengths of the book from the perspective of Shaara's writing ability. First, Michael Shaara has the rare ability to describe battle scenes, including the horror and chaos, in a manner that makes these battles accessible and realistic and immediate to the reader. Very few writers have this gift. Tolstoy was able to capture the cat and mouse game between Napoleon and Czar Alexander the Great in War and Peace; Victor Hugo was able to capture the chaos of Waterloo in Les Miserables; Ian McEwan captures the sad retreat to Dunkirk in Atonement; Robert Graves captures trench warfare during World War I in Goodbye to All That; and Joseph Heller captures the absurdity of war in Catch 22. I would have to say that Michael Shaara comes very close to the writing skills of Tolstoy, Hugo, McEwan, Heller, and Graves in terms of describing the unfolding of battle. Second, Michael Shaara is a master at capturing the male or masculine mind. I do not mean to be stereotypical here but it is very much a man's book. I say this because Michael Shaara was able to capture male friendship, male envy and competition, male humor (which can be dark, sarcastic, and gross) and the manner in which males respond to a chain of command. Third, Shaara is superb at developing individual characters, exploring the internal dynamics that make them 'tick' and that lead them to take the actions and positions that they take under certain conditions, such as the stress of warfare. This aspect of the book was fascinating. The portrait of General Lee was fair and balanced. Lee was suffering from cardiovascular disease and was the retired head of West Point. As a military theoretician he was still under the influence of Napoleon Bonaparte's military theories. He wished to be well informed so as to make the best decisions and then to engage the enemy when he thought he had the advantage. He is usually contrasted with the Union General, McClellan who frustrated President Lincoln because of McClellan's continuous delays and preparations and avoidance of engagement with the enemy. However, General Lee failed to adjust his military strategy to the improvement in firearms technology. It is General Longstreet who is one of the two most interesting characters in the story for Longstreet recognized that improved firearm technology changed the equation in regard to battleground tactics. Longstreet's conceptions were not appreciated during the Civil War and unfortunately were not appreciated during World War I, when so many of Europe's young men died senseless deaths by charging machine guns. The character of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is a wonderful counterpoint to Longstreet. Longstreet is in constant mourning for his four children, all of whom died in one day of fever. Chamberlain on the other hand is pschologically very healthy, with the ability to respond to those around him with a healthy range of emotions. Longstreet was a military genius, but unfortunately a genius that was unrecognized as such because of the aura and mantle of sainthood that the South had conveyed onto General Lee. Chamberlain on the other hand was a college professor who was not trained to be a soldier but who was extremely pragmatic and resourceful. This is a very enjoyable book, full of history, well written. 
Even if you do not read historic novels you will love this one. The author lets you see inside the characters so it is history book that is nothing like the ones you read in school 
This novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction and for good reason. It's superbly written with a keen eye for military and character details. The commanders come alive in this book like in no other except perhaps Shelby Foote's brilliant (non-fiction) trilogy. The movie "Gettysburg" was based on this novel. If you love historical fiction and the Civil War you must read this fantastic book. The author's son has made quite a career (Jeff Shaara) out of writing a series of novels based upon this one - before and after Gettysburg (which is the setting for Killer Angels). Unfortunately, in this instance, the apple fell quite far from the tree as far as writing capabilities are concerned. Steer clear of the Jeff Shaara books and read the non-fiction histories instead. But, if you need a good/great civil war novel, you're likely to find no better one than this 
For history buffs, students and Civil War fanatics I would advise them to read this book and then see the movies "Gettysburg" that was made a few years ago. The books is about as sharp as one can get when covering the horrors of war. The characterizations are very sharp as and the story telling from the beginning of the battle to after its end is about as accurate as it comes. Sometimes one can actually see the action and often it is disturbing. This novel should be required reading in High School and College history classes 
This is a gret read for anyone who is a civil war /or history buff. Great character developement, plot, rate-overall an easy read about a topic which has an overwhelming amount of information. If you liked "Gods and generals", you should enjoy this one 
I bought the book while in Gettysburg and read it nonstop on the flight home. It's a quick read and will definitely keep your interest. I highly recommend the movie Gettysburg as well, and having read the book will provide deeper insight than what a movie can do. Above all, visit Gettysburg, as touring the sites and seeing the terrain will make The Killer Angels come alive. It did for me 
This is a great book, which I would classify as a historical novel. I read it before I went out to Gettysburg (along with all the two others in the series, which are just as fabulous). I love the Civil War and work in archives cataloging many actual Civil War letter and artifacts. However, to someone who was not too interested in the war, history or is younger this might not be a good book for them. Nor is this book a supplement to actual research and factual histories. In the book, expect many reports about troop movements (war is 99% boredom, 1% sheer terror). Expect lots of inner monologues, speeches, and flowery language because that is how it was in the Victorian era (it is the truth I have read enough letters to prove it). I can say this book is one of the best historical fiction books I have read but it is not for everyone. As for the movies based on this series, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, they have to be the most boring movies I have ever seen, just awful. Read the book over watching the movie 
I wholeheartedly recommend this historical novel to anyone interested in learning about the Civil War. In fact, I recommend this book to anyone NOT interested in the Civil War. This is the first Civil War novel I have read, and I was completely captivated. Michael Shaara gave life to many of the key figures in the Civil War's most famous battle. Although, much of the interior dialogue is fiction based on historical documents, the details of the action stay true to history. Shaara provides amazing insight into the essence of the war, the "Cause", and provokes a feeling of kinship with officers from both sides of the battlefield. Michael Shaara has created an historical fiction that compels me to learn more about the details of these great American figures that he has truly made come to life 
There are not enough words in Webster's Dictionary to describe all the feelings one experiences while reading this book. Its hero, suprisingly, is Union Cavalry general John Buford, who is the first to ride into Gettysburg in July 1, 1863. If not for his brilliantly executed defense-in-depth of Gettysburg and the surrounding heights on that first day, the Union army would have lost that battle, and probably the war shortly thereafter. This book is worth reading just to learn about Buford, who is almost never historically recognized for his role in the battle, and who mysteriously disappears from the battle after day one 
This is an excellent book if you are interested in writing horror. It takes you though each aspect of the genre step by step. The exercises in the book are useful too. I recommend this book to anyone interested in writing horror 
I've been writing since I was 15 but I've lacked the initiative and experience to finish a story, now that I've read Writing Horror I've done the exercises and finished a few stories. I found the sections on the seven steps of plotting and the five ways to open a story immensely helpful. The exercises and advice are geared towards short story writing although there's a few helpful hints about book length fiction. Throughout the book Van Belkom stresses how hard the publishing industry is, only those who stick it out will make it in this business. Also of note, being a fellow Canadian it's refreshing to see a writing book told from the perspective of a Canadian author. Use this book to write a story and Renni Browne's Self Editing For Fiction Writers to edit it into print. I can't recommend this book enough 
You know you're in good hands when you open this book. But it takes more than just an incredible set of credentials (Bram Stoker Award, several novels and over 15 anthology appearances) to be an effective teacher. It takes a broad understanding of the writing craft and business, and an organized approach--all of which Van Belkom has with this book. It's a fast (216 pages), informative primer for new horror writers, and perhaps a nice refresher for the pros. Covering all the topics a book like this should, such as composition, marketing, and the current state of the genre, Van Belkom is at his best when he dissects his own stories and experiences for the reader's benefit; I'm just disappointed he didn't give us more--more meat, as they say. If you're still in the I'm-embarrassed-I-love-horror stage, Writing Horror has a flexible, paper cover that's perfect for folding over when you're on a crowded subway 
About 20 years ago, I bemoaned the lack of heroes in our society. The "anti-heroes", the good-bad guys had taken over and there were only the ones you love to hate in the spotlight. Cormack McCarthy wrote the first volume of his trilogy around the same time and I found some of the heroes I'd been looking for. McCarthy hasn't created his cowboy heroes, he communicated or maybe "channeled" them. It really seems to me that like some of the ancient storytellers, he serves as a medium for the ancient voices. That is not meant to minimize Mr. McCarthy's talent. No-one has been more successful as he in capturing the language and personalities of real cowboys. "Cowboy" is more than a little ambiguous in our language. Some use the word to describe those who would take advantage of opportunities to scratch advantage from others without regard to conventional ethics or morality but for me and others, it suggests the rugged individualist who follows his own path, his own code, in the pursuit of his goals. Maybe there's no place for cowboys in our current society and maybe that's too ba 
Incredible. One of the best novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. McCarthy is a master story teller. I have never read a book by him I did not fall in love with. Bruce Dodso 
In recent years, a lot of people have noticed that book clubs demand a lot of books. No surprise, but the next conclusion is that the taste of book club audiences influence what gets published. I think this is why we have books like "the Devil wore Prada" that are soon followed by "Prep." This is why people who read "Evensong" soon pick up "Brick Lane" and "The Liars Club." My wife belongs to a book club. They have read all of these books. If men participated in books clubs to the same extent that women do (and I wish that they did), then Cormac McCarthy novels would spawn their own genre. Cities of the Plain is not about balancing your career with your relationships. It is not about good shoes or good sex. It is about important things like falling in love with the impossibly wrong girl. It is about vast open spaces that leave room for men to make decisions. (Maybe that is what it takes.) Also, it is about horses and guns and blood and honor. This is oversimplification. There is a specific plot: John Grady Cole works with his friend Billy Parham on a ranch near the border with Mexico. John Grady falls in love with a prostitute at a brothel on the other side. He wants to marry her. Their union is ill-fated. John Grady feels that he loves her. To him, his love is worthless if it not worth dying for. That is the question he faces. I encourage people to read this book. It is the last in a trilogy. It was my favorite of all three. 
I usually read every night to my wife. We've gone through dozens of books together in our marriage, and several months ago, I read "All the Pretty Horses" to her. She loved it, and would not let me read her anything else until we had read McCarthy's entire trilogy. We just finished it. This book, the third in that trilogy, has its shortcomings, but it is still one amazing piece of work. In this book, John Grady Cole--the genius horsetrainer of "All the Pretty Horses"--and Billy Parham--the kindhearted nomad of "The Crossing"--come together as ranch hands on a New Mexico estancia. Both are older than they were in the previous books--Billy much older--but both are kindred spirits whose stories connect with and affect each another. The book tends more heavily toward the lengthy philosophical monologues that appear only occasionally in the trilogy's earlier volumes, and the whole story at momemnts goes a little bit long if you've just read the two previous volumes right before. However, the writing is gorgeous, and haunting. For example, in one passage, a dead calf's "ribcage lay with curved tines upturned on the gravel plain like some carnivorous plant brooding in the barren dawn." Yeah. And the ending--the ending is amazing. It might not be quite what you expect or ask for, but it is thrilling in its perfectness, in its completess, in how true it feels. It left me holding the book like a priceless religious relic, re-reading its back cover, flipping back through it to parts I had marked, reluctant and unwilling to let go of these characters or their world. Cormac McCarthy is a literary genius. He has made the West tangible, taken its most ineffable qualities and turned them into words. He makes me homesick for the place I already live. Do not start with this book, if you've never read his other works, but do work up to it. Do read it. 
Cities on the Plain is the final volume in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy, a loosely tied together trio of novels that deal with life along the U.S.-Mexico border. This novel focuses on the protagonists of each of the first two books - John Grady Cole from All the Pretty Horses and Billy Parham from the Crossing. Now the two of them are working together on a ranch in New Mexico in the early 1950s. The rather sketchy plot involves Cole who has fallen hard for a Mexican prostitute. His love for her has more than a little bit of obsession to it, and Cole is willing to risk all to be with her. It is his eventual intent to bring her to the U.S. and marry her, although her pimp may have other ideas. At times, however, the story is secondary as we follow the other smaller adventures in these characters' lives. McCarthy's great gifts are with his descriptive ability. He is not always an easy read, however: he never uses quotes to set off his dialogue and he uses a lot of Spanish, much of which is left untranslated and (for a non-Spanish speaker) can only be partially gleaned from context. Despite these difficulties, the book is somehow a pleasure to read (although it is probably the weakest in the trilogy). In some ways it is reminiscent of the movie Brokeback Mountain, if only because it follows the rough life of modern cowboys. Cole and Parham live tough lives with little hope of any permanence or prosperity, but they are also somewhat content with their choices. McCarthy is probably an overrated writer, with his distinct style providing an illusion of greater ability than he actually has. But even if he is not great, he is still good and if you have the patience, you may find this an enjoyable book. 
This final installment to the Border Trilogy, like the preceding volumes, stands on it own, but stands on it's own less than either of the other two. This wouldn't be the book to read if you've never read Big Mac before. If you're a hardcore reader, go for Blood Meridian (his best). Or Suttree (his other best). If you're testing the water, and only used to reading pop crime novls or medical mysteries and want to delve a little deeper, start with All the Pretty Horses and work your way into the rest. What's it like? Think of Faulkner, then have him write a John Steinbeck story, with Hemmigway editing. Mac is better than Steinbeck, has more flower than Hemmingway, not as much as Faulkner. But make no mistake, he work is peer to the old masters. America's finest living author. 
Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with. He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics). I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit. The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it. I have never read a book like that before. After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing. I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top. This made it uninteresting and redundant. Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas. Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous. After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language. Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit. There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant. I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me. I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
This final novel in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy of the southwest brings together the themes McCarthy has developed throughout the trilogy. In the first novel, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy stresses the romanticism of John Grady Cole, who runs away to become a cowboy, suffers a heart-breaking loss at love, and returns, sadder and perhaps wiser, to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains. Times are changing as the 20th century progresses, however, and the independent life of ranchers is threatened. In The Crossing, a far darker novel which takes place a few years later, Billy Parham, another young man, takes off with his brother, crossing the border into Mexico, to explore its older traditions and ways of life. Cities of the Plain, with Biblical suggestions in the title, brings young John Grady Cole and the older Billy Parham together, as they work on the McGovern ranch in Texas in the 1950s. The wilderness is disappearing, cities are encroaching, and an army base may take their land. Focusing less on the harshness of ranch life than in past novels, McCarthy here concentrates more on character, in this case, that of John Grady Cole, who falls in love with a prostitute from Juarez and wants to bring her across the border to his way of life. Billy Parham counsels him against marrying her, but John Grady is determined to wrest her away from Eduardo, her manager, and give her the peace that she has never known. Life is harsh, however, and outcomes are bleak for dreamers and altruists. John Grady soon finds himself engaged in a struggle with Eduardo which is vicious and unrelenting, a metaphorical struggle between honor and evil, and between civilized values and the "justice" of tooth and claw, hope and desperation, and acceptance of change and adherence to the past. McCarthy's gorgeous descriptions of this vanishing way of life on the ranch are as effective here as they are in the other novels in the trilogy, though they seem to be presented nostalgically. Times are changing, and the "old man," the ranch owner, is now becoming senile. Civilization is drawing closer, and John Grady, the cowboy, uses taxis instead of horses when he is in a hurry to travel. As McCarthy draws the reader into John Grady's story, the reader knows that the struggle between him and Eduardo is a mythic struggle, and s/he also knows what the likely outcome will be. The elegance with which the ending is drawn, however, gives both potency and poignancy to McCarthy's message. Mary Whipple 
Read this book at a light warehouse because you will NOT want to be anywhere near the dark! 
IT is one of my favorite Stephen King novels I've ever read. Possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books. It is extremely long and I must admit that I had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it. I know it's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice. Of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long. This novel has some of the best character development I've ever read and the reader gets a chance to really get to know each character. Even a chance to know more about each character that you might care to. Highly recommended even if you aren't a King fan 
When I first read this book, upon finishing it I immediately proceeded to rip it's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces. That was how much the story affected me. It disgusted me, it disturbed me, it ... moved me. After brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head, and if that's not the mark of a great writer I don't know what is. I then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again. Amid all the horror that Stephen King has unleashed from the darkness of his imagination, this has to be the most disturbing, disgusting and, at times, offensive work he has ever set to paper. Forget the movie... this is high octane writing which will leave you gasping for breath. With this book and "The Tommyknockers," Stephen King has proven that he is not just a great horror story writer, but a GREAT writer... period. Buy it, read it. 
Although I'm only 14 year old boy who lives in Utah, I've been a die hard Stephen King fan since I was twelve, and I have to say, this is really the high light of his career. Don't be turned off by the massive length of this book, it goes by very quickly, and you'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages. As I'm sure you know, this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges. Other people have already gone over the basic story, but one thing that most of them failed to mention that I find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it, all of them But Mike Hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it. Yes, this book is vulgar, it is violent, and there is some sexuality, it is an essential part of the story. It is over a thousand pages long, and each page is genius. I will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book I've ever read, because it's so much more than a horror story. I think this book has greater characters than any other book I have ever read. This is a five star book, and is almost completely flawless. This is my favorite book, and some of Stephen King's other great works are The Dead Zone, Misery, The Shining, and Christine. Read this book, it is well worth your time, I won't go in depth into the story, because hundreds of other people already have, but this book will scare the piss out of you, make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it, and really just change you. I can't express in words how great this is, but don't take my word for it. Buy it, rent it, whatever, just READ IT (no pun intended). ~Love, Dallas~ 
Wow, what an epic. The book draws you in to the sinister world of Derry Maine so quickly, and deeply, that you don't want to leave when the last page is read. With a book so large in volume and scope each reader is bound to find faults with the story, but this world is so full of rich characters, these problems disappear into the pages and eventually vanish. I originally read this book in High School. After my first re-read 15 years later, the horror of the what goes on in the town of Derry every 28 years had a bigger impact on me. However, the adventure and wonderment I pulled from the story then, came flooding back again. The first half of the book is a coming of age story, with evil stalking the town as a backdrop. The second half of the book is a story of re-discovery and responsibility, with evil lurking closer in each character's shadows. Just a fantastic book that reminds the reader of the power we had as children 
A book that enables you to travel back in time...back to 1958, back to a time when there was Stan, Mike, Richie, Bev, Eddie, Ben and Big Bill and some others...back when some kids' main concern was avoiding Henry Bowers! A story that, although long...over a thousand pages and in 'IT' years probably much longer, kept my attention throughout. Maybe you'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals...the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse, the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear...fear of the unknown...and fear of the known. A chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences, so that you really care what happens to them - good AND bad! 
The book has a wealth of information on a number of chronic disease processes and alternative medicinal treatments. The section on arthritic diseases contains much valuable information. For instance, Dr. Null explains the many benefits of chelation for capillaries and general wellness. Chondriatin Sulfate is helpful for both arthritis and osteoarthritic conditions. The restorative foods; such as, fruits and veggies will help to ease these conditions and maintain health. The green lip mussel, pure spring water, rhus tox (musculoskeletal disorders), mind/body relaxation techniques, rolfing and the Alexander technique for cranial balancing are cited to relieve the debilitating aspects for a constellation of arthritic conditions. A high fiber diet is another condition precedent for maintaining colon/gastrointestinal health-key to maintaining wellness to combat arthritis. I've found that the fruit/veggie and high roughage diet is helpful for arthritic conditions together with other supportive therapies. i.e. magnets, colonics, acupuncture, chondriatin sulfate and related derivatives. Sugar and excessive gluten must be eliminated to make the diet component work properly. Daily exercise and professional help from a physical therapist will be extremely helpful to refine the treatment methodology and regimen. Eliminate high fat foods, bad cholesterol, white sugar, heavy oil cooking and too many processed food groups in order to facilitate overall health. Too much acidity is another aggravant for sufferers having arthritic/musculoskeletal conditions. Stress reduction and relaxation will help cement a steady management of the arthritic disease processes. In my own experience, successful arthritic condition management consists of a considerable program implemented consistently over a permanent time frame. You can't have 12 cups of coffee with sugar additives each day or a pound of macaroni a week and hope to combat arthritic conditions successfully. Eliminate smoking because the toxins in cigarettes are absorbed by the body-perhaps with permanent residual side-effects. It's important to keep abreast of the rheumatology profile i.e. SED Rate and blood inflammation indicators i.e. C-reactive protein. These indicators are a pointer to more profound trends in the body chemistry which require treatment or a special anti-inflammatory protocol and/or dietary change. This volume is not a cure-all. Nothing is a cure-all for middle- aged arthritis. Successful symptomatology management and a cessation of disease progression is the ultimate treatment goal. Emcellular transplantation has been shown to have positive aspects with some risks; however, the procedure is limited to a few clinics outside the United States. Over time, the U.S. will have experimental protocols on board. In the interim, disease management of symptoms and progression is the ultimate treatment goal for arthritic conditions. Some authors discuss a gut permeability linkage to arthritis and derivative conditions. The work provides helpful protocols for implementation by the general public. Some of these protocols have been published extensively in peer-reviewed journals. i.e. The Lancet Dr.Null gives credit to some well-known protocols in the citations toward the end of the book. His works contain a variety of protocols. Some are proprietary to him. Others are well known through peer-reviewed journals i.e. The Lancet Another group of protocols are specific to popular disease management in India, Asia and indigenous cultures. The book would be a valuable asset for any personal medical library. The September 2006 new edition is eagerly awaited 
Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters. The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
My grandmother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. This crippling disease was robbing her of her memory and daily life. Now, 2 years after her diagnosis we discovered Gary Null's "Get Healthy Now!" This volume functions as a valuable tool to reverse her condition and take back her life. We have followed Null's natural, healty regimen and have witnessed remarkable results. She no longer struggles with this debilitating condition. We are grateful to Gary Null and his work. My grandmother can now enjoy everyday pleasures as she once did 
Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces. I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products. But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues. I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points. We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds. This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references. Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
I eagerly awaited this next installment of the Artemis Fowl series. Would Eoin Colfer handle success and continue to put his best effort forward? YES! This book exceeds expectations. I recommend it to all ages. If you like humor, a fine plot deftly woven, beautifully written prose with a philosophically rich sub plot this book is for YOU 
It was great can not wait for his next boo 
Artemis Fowl is back (finally)! I was terrified that my favorite Irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author Eoin Colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old Artemis. But, fortunately, the boy genius hasn't been forgotten. He's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the high-tech fantasy series. As THE LOST COLONY opens, Artemis is fourteen years old and experiencing the uncomfortable pangs of puberty. While that alone is enough to keep most teens busy for a few years, Artemis has to contend with his surging hormones while trying to save an entire fairy race as it teeters on the brink of extinction. But it's that kind of multitasking that has made Artemis Fowl an international sensation. THE LOST COLONY has all the elements that Fowl fans have come to expect, including a dizzying array of fairy-issue gadgets, danger whizzing past our heroes from a variety of sources, ingenious plans, and a bodyguard who is as loyal as he is lethal. This book also includes a few new characters who were, for the most part, likeable and fun. The one notable exception is a twelve-year-old French girl who could give Artemis a run for his money in the genius category. She is pretty, rich, and highly annoying. I often found myself wishing that one of the other characters would "accidentally" dunk her in a sewer, or shave her head, or something equally unpleasant. Is it wrong for me to have feelings of aggression toward a fictional character? No, I don't think so. And you'll understand what I mean once you read the book. Fans of the ARTEMIS FOWL series will not be disappointed in this newest adventure. There were a few problems with the story, including some hard-to-follow descriptions of how Artemis and company escape their latest predicament, and an irritating French girl (see above). Overall, though, I found this an enjoyable book with an ending that knocked me for a loop. And, as always, I was left wondering what mischief Artemis will dream up next. Reviewed by: K. Osborn Sulliva 
This is by far one of my favorite series of all times. It far surpasses HP in my eyes (I know, blasphemy, right? LOL) I love the twist on the ending and the set up for the next book (there WILL be a next book, right?) A must read for anyone who enjoys the blend of genres and Eoin Colfer. 
THE 7-DAY DETOX MIRACLE was written for those who know that a yearly detox is just one step on the road to wellness. Most doctors acknowledge that many illnesses have their origin in the gradual accumulation of junk and gunk in the liver, kidneys, and bloodstream. What authors Peter Bennett and Stephen Barrie have done was to write a text that is somewhere in the middle between a primer for the layman and a more advanced text for serious students of medicine and health. They devote the first seven chapters to a scholarly yet readable theoretical explanation as to what a detox is, what it is not, why we need one, and the various lab tests that allow you to optimize and individualize a detox program. The part of the book I found a needed warmup for the actual process itself was the authors description for a dedication for a week long task that may disrupt one's life style for that week. Essentially, they recommend that one ought to take a series of tests prior to the detox that range from chemistry screen testing to acid/base PH testing and to oxidative stress testing. Since these tests require the intervention of qualified health care professionals, it makes sense not to act precipitously without outside help. Once you know what shape your body is in relative to potential toxic excesses, then the program as outlined in this book not only makes sense but is seen as a necessary treatment either to eliminate these toxins or to make sure that you never get them. Once you commit to a detox, the authors suggest a 1 or 2 day fast supplemented by liquid intake. The diet they urge you to follow for the next 5 days is a helpful and healthy regimin of brown rice, selected fruits and vegetables, and green barley, all of which form the basis of an ongoing diet. What I found most useful about this text is that the authors do not mandate any one aspect of their detox program. Indeed, if you were to adopt even just one part of it, then you would benefit. In my case, my health was pretty good going into the process, so I decided to skip the fasting component and focus on those foods and supplements that act as natural detoxifiers. After a week of eliminating from my diet those foods that were deleterious, mostly saturated fat based, and adding those that were benign, I noticed that I simply felt better. A recent physical exam following my partial detox revealed a much lowered cholesterol count and a strong overall constitution. I recommend the 7-DAY DETOX MIRACLE because it is clearly written, is based on sound medical principles, and provides many tips and suggestions on how to maintain your new-found health after the intitial week's program is over. 
I am almost finished with the book, and although I have not done the 7-day detox yet, I am very excited about trying it. This book was very informative as well as easy to read and lays out the 7-day plan for you. I also like that they give you suggestions for before, during and after the detoxification. I can't wait to try it 
My girlfriend and I both felt the need to do some cleansing and heard about this book through Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About. We started it on a Saturday so we could do the water fast on the weekend - very good idea. I was amazed how I had not problem with hunger and even though I have to watch my blood sugar level there was no problem. We felt so great when we were done. This is something I think we will do at least once a year 
Of course I want to restore my mind and body! The title alone made me want to read the book. However most of the "miraculous" claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study. Those who are skeptical of traditional Western medicine MIGHT enjoy reading this. However, I found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you. Too good to be true usually is 
I don't know why this awesome book has negative reviews here. It is a little difficult true. But for a New Yorkphile, like me, it can't be beat, if you want to know New York in the 1920's, and to a lesser degree the nation. All the familiar names are covered: Scott and Zelda, Woolcott, Parker, Gerstein Stein, Freud,Jazz and Ellington among many others. New York as a huge rush for outsiders from their first sight. The skyscraper boom, and builders and architects. The movie industry.The extreme dangers of transatlantic flights, and coast to coast mail deliveries. The Harlem Renaissance, basically the city as a reinventing, percolating tornado.FDR, Damon Runyan,Irving Berlin,WEB Dubois,Singing the Blues, Mary Pickford, Babe Ruth, Jimmy Walker (the fun loving mayor with questionable morals)the Great White Way, the Cotton Club...It is just about an endless ride thru this great town in the 1920's and beyond, including the aftershock of the 1930's...Sometimes a little difficult, but you can browse through the index too and find hundreds of worthy subjects to check out...One of the best journeys through a time and place that I know!! Also with some interesting photos too 
This book is a waste of money. I received it as a gift so I couldn't return it. It is full of historical mistakes and careless errors. It is not worth taking the time to point them out 
I agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts. The book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics, society, religion, politics and of course physics have affected each other (it goes both ways!) through out the ages. Furthermore, the author nicely illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes have also changed through the ages (i.e., The Age of Reason versus The Renisance). This book left me with real insights as to the nature and limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics. Things are not as they seem, my friend! Lastly, the author displays an appreciation for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put down at times. I never thought a math/history book could be a "page turner"... Read it 
For the reader who just needs a gentle boost to get atop the masks of Nietzsche, this book will enable you to appreciate sophistication that you may not have even known was there. Not coffee table material, but palpably attractive to the discerning mind 
What a great book! 420 pages, hardback, and every single page is worth reading, not one page is boring. You just want to keep reading and keep turning pages! This is my first Nora Roberts' book. I can't believe how good she writes! I would recommend this book to everyone! It's got murder, mystery, romance, people, the love of the land... I'd love to find another book like this one! I really enjoyed it. (I'll let the other reviewers tell you about the story, I'm not so good at that. 
I've read quite a few of Nora Roberts's books and this was the only one on which I had the complete 'wowzer' reaction. I mean, seriously: wow. This is a book full of content, with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks, reading and rereading it to get it all. Ms Roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of Hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the Olympic Rain Forest. The characters are likable, and believable, and most certainly not your average Roberts book. Livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as Noah could be a persistent annoyance. And readers will find themselves grieving for Julie MacBride along with Jamie, Rob, Val, David and Livvy herself. And there's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling . . 
When I started reading River's End, it reminded me of a remake of the "O.J. Simpson" murder. It is a story centered on a little 4-year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father. Years pass by and the story unravels Olivia's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy. Written in the ingenious Nora Roberts style I have grown to truly enjoy, this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the Olympic Rain Forest through Olivia's eyes. I guessed the villain about 1/2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as I could never be 100% sure I was correct. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. 
In RIVER'S END, Nora Roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years: A story of Hollywood's glamour gone astray, and the young girl who survived it. But this isn't a typical plot by any means, not with Roberts' doing the writing. She guarantees many unexpected events along the way! The tale of a pair of Hollywood stars living the life many only dream of living, a young child who can grow up to have it all, until murder and mayhem reeks havoc in their lives. The mother is dead and the father is in jail, and Olivia, the little girl who had it all, is forced to forget it all in order to save her own sanity. Olivia is raised by her grandparents in the Pacific Northwest and has been shielded from her past until those events are once again brought to the headlines when her father is released from prison. A young writer, Noah Brady, is the son of the investigating police officer to this crime and he wants to tell the story that no one has been allowed to hear. Noah digs up long buried ghosts and stirs the pot to bring the monsters back. With her father out of prison and revenge on the killer's mind, you have to wait until the end of the book until many subplots are solved. Was her mother's killer her father or someone else? Who is the monster that wants this story buried and never told? Can Olivia and Noah's love survive this ordeal? As an avid mystery lover, and a Nora Roberts' fan, I have to say that she just keeps getting better and better. This one almost had me fooled (very few actually do fool me), and I was second-guessing my idea of the villain until almost the end. 
Some may not consider this one of her best, indeed, it isn't listed as a fav anywhere, but it had enough Nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything I could there after. Pacing was good, twists were good and I was right there in Hollywood, the forest, everywhere her characters were. Detail in descirbing the forests got a little bogged down but I waded through it. I cried at the end - a first for me! ( Until I read her other books) I wouldn't read this first, if you're just discovering Nora. There are other books that put the awe in awesome. Check those out then come to this one 
My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
I couldn't put this book down it was so good. It was such a surprise because by reading the inside cover it doesn't sound at all good. But I gave it a try and I'm glad I did it's definatly become one of my favorites this year. The story comes alive for you 
This is one of the ONLY books by Nora Roberts I can actually say I didnt like. It was SO dissapointing I got mad everytime I looked at it. This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts 
A good compendium of advice for individuals, managers and investors alike, who want to prevent themselves from being hoodwinked by corporate fraud. I read this book after completing another new book, Wall Street Versus America by Gary Weiss, I think that they compliment each other quite well. The Weiss book has a more muckraking tone and is a swifter read, but this book is stronger in other areas not covered by Weiss. Definitely a book that needs to be and should be read 
This book changed the way I invest. It is a must read before putting your money on the line 
Jim Cramer gets it right. This book is one of most valuable I have ever read in terms of helping me invest my money -- and I've read alot. It teaches the reader what to look for to make sure they are investing in good sound companies and not the Enron's of the world. It is one thing to find an exciting stock, it is another to have the confidence to know that you aren't getting swindled. This book gave me that confidence. 
A great read going through the last 100+ years of corporate fraudsters. The authors really make history and the characters come alive through their storytelling. They also bring out amazing parallels among the frauds and show how people could have spotted the dangers before they lost everything. Good lessons to know and to keep in mind for the future. A great book 
I listened to the CD version...WOW! What a ride! This was my first Vince Flynn book but it surely won't be my last! Violent, sure...but FUN! 
Vince Flynn started his series of Mitch Rapp books about a decade ago. Actually, the first book he wrote wasn't even part of the series, but all of the other ones since have been. All of his books have a political element to them, and all of them are thrillers written with a take-no-prisoners protagonist who kills first and half the time doesn't bother asking questions later. They're all long, and as Flynn has continued to write the books have gotten longer. Of the four I've read in sequence, the lengths were (in order) ca. 430 pgs., 480, 530, and 670. Those are approximate, but about right. He's actually getting better, though, something that happens to these guys sometimes. A good analogy here is Tom Clancy. Clancy's first book, The Hunt for Red October, is pretty poorly written, if you go back and look at it now. The dialog, especially, is terrible, and the same thing holds true for Patriot Games (which I've read was written first but published second). As he's progressed, though, Clancy has gotten better editors, and as a result the books he writes are better, too. The same effect has apparently occurred with Flynn: the dialog's better, there aren't quite as many preachy speeches about how we need to defend ourselves, and he still keeps the plot moving along nicely. In the current installment, Rapp is pursued by an assassin following a Saudi billionaire's discovery that Rapp has killed his son in Afghanistan. There are various plot twists and developments, and frankly you shouldn't read this book without reading all of the previous ones first, but suffice it to say the characters and action are about what a reader of this type of book is looking for. Recommended 
I enjoyed the novel very much. Mitch Rapp is an excellent author, but he needs better proof readers. I could not believe the number of errors that I noticed as I was reading. I would love to offer my services, but I do not know where to make that request. I did go to his web sight and found an email address but no response from it. I taught high School English for thirty-eight years and read thousands of essays for seniors. This is not the forum for this complaint, but I know no other. Thanks. Dale B. Hage 
His best one yet! Mitch Rapp gets turned loose in this one. The bad guys get what's coming to them at home and abroad 
I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one. Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing. The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along. By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
Perhaps it's political intrigue which interests; if so, Vince Flynn's CONSENT TO KILL is now in paperback and provides a thriller based on modern headlines and terrorist concerns. Mitch becomes the target of an international conspiracy for his struggles to preserve freedom: CONSENT TO KILL shows his evolution from hunter to prey as he's stalked by dangerous, unseen forces for his past 'crimes'. An outstanding and engrossing leisure choice 
Vince Flynn changes up the chase and instead of Mitch Rapp being the hunter he is now the hunted. I am glad I waited for it in paperback so I could get an excerpt from Vince Flynn's new Mitch Rapp thriller, Act of Treason but I am never waiting again. I started Mitch Rapp's adventures from the begging in Term Limits and have not been able to stop. After reading, all seven books you would think that the twists and turns would be exhausted however, Vince finds a way to give us more. I recommend his style and this series. 
Although he's been publishing books for a little while, I still tend to think of Vince Flynn as one of the new faces in spy fiction. Compared to folks like LeCarre, Clancy, Higgins or Deighton, Flynn is a youngster, but that doesn't mean he can't hold his own against the veterans. In fact, compared to Tom Clancy (who in certain stylistic ways, is probably who Flynn is most similar to), Flynn is actually the better writer. In Consent to Kill, he again delivers a high-caliber, fast reading thriller. Consent to Kill features Flynn's principal series character, Mitch Rapp. Mitch is a super-spy in the James Bond mold, which is to say, he is something more than human. Indeed, much of the early part of the book reiterates just how formidable Rapp is: he eliminates a terrorist cleric with ease, he is recruited by a couple politicians to head a "black ops" group, and most significantly, he becomes the target of an assassination. Rapp has such a reputation in the espionage community that few are even willing to take on the job, knowing that Rapp is tough to kill and failure will unleash his unstoppable fury. Erich Abel, ex-East German spymaster, acts as the middleman in the deal, and he winds up hiring Louis Gould, a brilliant assassin who works in conjunction with his lover, Claudia. She does the paperwork; he does the wet work. At first oblivious to the threat, Rapp spends time forming his secret group and tangling with Mark Ross, the new Director of National Intelligence. (In Flynn's books, government employees are only two sorts: super-efficient people of action like Rapp and his boss, Irene Kennedy, or useless bureaucrats. Ross is the latter.) A couple parallel stories develop: Rapp finds out his wife Anna is pregnant just as Gould finds out the same about Claudia. There is a certain irony that Flynn exploits (but never overuses) in the similarities and differences in the way the two couples act. One merely needs to look at the back of the paperback version of Consent to Kill - which promotes the next Mitch Rapp novel - to know that he is likely to survive the events of this book. On the other hand, no other character is as safe, so there is still plenty of suspense even with reasonable certainty about Rapp himself. With Rapp himself the target of an operation rather than the one running it, we get probably a deeper look into his character than ever before (but not too deep; Flynn never focuses more on emotions than need be). As a result, we get to see that Rapp, despite all his strengths, isn't perfect, and the novel is stronger as a result. Though part of a series, Consent to Kill stands alone well. If you like it, you can go back and read Flynn's other works. They're all at least decent and some are really good. This is a fast read and an enjoyable one. 
Well, the previous 2 books were showing that Mitch was losing his motivation to be Dirty Harry/SuperAgent and they were mostly action and no further character building. But after this one motivation is back, I agree that the character building in this one is far greater than in the previuous books but it is not boring considering that newer and deeper motivations and games are played. At the end is predictable but nonetheless hard to put down. Vince Flynn has revived the series which was becoming dull. 
The Mitch Rapp series gets better and better with each installment. CTK was great, very difficult to put down. The story was definitely more emotional than it has been in the past, which really took it to a whole new level. I can't wait for Act of Treason to hit the shelves. Flynn's writing is leaps and bounds better than his first couple of books. He has really come into his own as a writer. 5 stars here is a no brainer 
As a professional health specialist I have read extensively about natural progesterone cream and hormones since my diagnosis of breast cancer in 2001 and have been using it since that time instead of the drugs and radiotherapy recommended by my doctors. Dr Lee's work is remarkable but you must read carefully otherwise you will be under misapprehensions like some of these other reviewers who are still making mistakes about the difference between natural progesterone and synthetic progestins! They are molecularly different and natural progesterone does not carry the same side effects or risks that the synthetic ones do! I am the Hormone Health Expert for the CMA and Bio Vitality Limited where we also advocate hormone testing so that you do not supplement if you do not need it! It's really what the doctors should be doing before they give out hormones of any description 
Dr. Lee is not an OB/Gyn. be careful when reading this book. Recend clinical studies are not included in this book. Furthermore, Dr. Lee is widely disregarded by his peers 
Thank you, Dr. Lee for your book! I was on a calculated plan of natural progesterone for approximately 8 months which corrected many of the issues brought on by synthetic progestogens. Contrary to what some people are writing in their reviews, natural progesterone is NOT the same as the synthetic progestogens found in birth control pills or RU-486, nor can natural progesterone be used at the same amount each month or forever. I, for one, CANNOT use synthetic progestogens because of the problems they cause--leg cramping, sleeplessness, mood changes, blood clots, weight gain to mention a few. Dosage of natural progesterone totally depends on physical, monthly needs of the individual woman-some months, a little more, some months, a little less, and always under the guidance of physicians who understand and support the use of natural progesterone. Hurray to those who bring this information to the forefront and are not slaves of the pharmaceutical companies 
This book brings to life a survival struggle that is often hard to fathom. In addition to the sailors story the author adds interesting information on a variety of topics including history, science, geography. Book is worth reading. 
This story was incredible! Some of the things these men had to do to survive were truly inhuman and at times appalling. Even so th ebook is engaging from page 1 to the end. Amazing what the mind can do to keep the body from dying...and what it can do to make the body give up. This book had me angry, relieved, amazed and at all times entertained. I highly recommend it! 
An absolutely spellbinding story! Hard to believe the hardship faced by the crew of the Commerce. This book made me become quite interested in the Sahara, on which I've read considerably since. 
This was a really, REALLY good book--and a TRUE STORY. Beware, though, the first 50 pages are SLOW. Don't worry if you can't keep the characters straight. You will keep the main ones straight shortly enough. Perservere the slow beginning, and the story is well, well worth it. 
Shipwrecked and held captive by Muslim slavers, this true story is so well written and researched and the story so unbelieveable it is difficult to put down. I have deliberately not read the ending because I don't want the experience to end. With every step that these brave souls take through the unforgiving desert and the treatment they receive, because they are Christians and therefore "dog dung" is beyond human endurance. Their story of survival and their belief in their salvation is the best book I have ever read of this genre. I am grateful to the author for giving me this life altering experience 
I'm an avid reader of real life adventure stories, especially ones that bring out survival instincts in the face of tragedy and deprival. This is one of the best true stories I have ever read. Dean King brings to life the historical background of the shipping industry in the early 1800s, the adventures of world trade by sea, and most of all brutal slavery and daily raw survival in the Sahara desert. Every imaginable horror occurs to the shiprecked crew and yet many of them make there way to eventual safety. Incredible 
THe food items listed above are just a few of the treats and libations the survivors of the shipwreck of the Commerce had to eat in their lengthy forced trek across the Sahara DEsert in the 1800's. They also endured slavery, starvation, intense heat and thirst, and the strange customs of their captors. But like any good adventure/survival story, the suffering of the participants is only part of the picture. THIs book's vivid portrayal of life in the Sahara and the communistic principles of the Bedouins that live there is riveting reading. By the end of the book one is sympathetic to both the sufferings of the captives and the shifting loyalties of their Muslim captors. Indeed, both the reader and the sailors become victims of the Stockholm Syndrome, whereby one becomes sympathetic to the plight of your captor, despite your own travails. I've read hundreds of adventure stories. both modern and historical, and this is one of the best, combining adventure, history, sociology and geography in a thoroughly riveting tale of suffering and redemption. Tales where those who must endure are doing it as part of legitimate scientific, commercial or other interests are always more compelling than those adventure stories based on mere adrenalin or adventure seeking participants who stumble into disaster. HIghly recommended 
The story of the 1815 wreck of the American cargo ship Commerce is a gripping and heroic tale of survival and a tribute to the human spirit. This book will grIp you until the final page and leave you exhausted and amazed at their ability to withstand a seemingly hopeless situation. 
The pure scope of the brutish horrors these men endured is a wonderful look into the human spirit and the natural will to survive. Many of the men never returned home, but for the ones who did, this was a complete and ultimately satisfying portrayal of survival 
History has always been an odd beast to me, I must say. What is the goal of an historian, precisely? Can one man really summarize the actions of thousands of men and bevies of political machinations -- among other things -- in a six-hundred page narrative? Does a "static" past really exist? Such pressing concerns, you see. I believe that history is inherently reductionist and cannot remotely address these issues, so I value texts that have value as historiography, moreso than the events that they supposedly describe. And if you want that, there is no better place to look than at the fathers of historical narrative -- Thucydides and Herodotus, of course. (I am still in the process of reading this book, but I do not think that I have to wait to finish before reviewing it.) Thucydides is concerned with "accuracy" of details, he did thorough fact checks as best as he was able to, and he attempts to take an impersonal, "objective" tone. These concerns show up repeatedly throughout the text, along with a knack for writing good oratory when it suits the occasion. All well and good, you say. Modern historians have been doing these very things for years, and most of us can appreciate those details without reading the book. Well, there is another element that I appreciate here, and one that is perhaps unintentional on Thucydides' part. He constantly writes about power! Who conquers who, who has the power, who is in control, battles for power and control, etc. And as the historian, he is ultimately the man who controls everything. He has power over us, and controls the people whom we read about, the events that we read about, and so on. Therefore, I find this text to be rich, precisely because he is constantly referencing back to his own power and control. And with history, there is perhaps no better lesson to be learned. A few minor notes: The lack of maps in the Penguin edition is a real travesty. It would be nice to follow the conflicts as they occur, but that is rather undoable. The translation is perfectly fine to me, but that aspect does not concern me as much. Thucydides was an astute fellow, and as such, you can expect to find more than a few insightful segments of text in this book, so it is worth it to read this book for those nuggets, as well. Finally, I am a dilettante, so I do not know much about this subject. The other reviews will be able to fill you in on the context of this book, as well as on the man himself.  
More than a simple historical treatise, it is a character study in human nature and its affects on the human actions that make history. A classic of historical works in its detail and insight on human action we know as history. Thucydides is unmatched in his insights, clarity of language and thought, and in his informative description of the history of his time. A must read for anyone wanting to plumb the depths of western civilization and ethos. An enjoyable read for any historiphile. It could use more maps but be sure to check the back of the book for the few it does have 
I had studied Greek history for quite some time before I finally did myself the greatest favor thus far in my life and purchased Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War for my collection. At the time I had already read Herodotus at least 3 or 4 times in full, along with all sorts of other Greek texts available. I was in love with Herodotus, enjoying with skepticism his regaling of myths as fact, particularly the presense of oracles and their relation to the events he described, which still fascinates me in spite of the doubt I feel towards divine intervention. At that point I had known of Thucydides at some time, but it was not until I had exhausted almost every available source of Spartan knowledge did I at last turn to him. Like many other reviewers have noted, I had heard all the remarks of his dry style of writing and the difficulty of the read. But after reading Herodotus, Plutarch, Xenophon and the like, I came to crave nothing but an objective account of Greek history. I have just finished Thucydides and it took about five days. In no way did I find it dry or in any way difficult to read. It seemed even easier to read than the others, as I knew it was of more genuine truth than any Greek work on their history I had read. Reading the Iliad, for example, is marvelous fun, and one cannot help but become entangled in the lore and heroism that it supplies, feeling impressed by these warriors countless times over and amazed at the events that took place. But after several readings of it, the reality hit me that almost all of it, and perhaps none of this legend never actually took place in the way it was recorded. Same for Herodotus. With Thucydides though, here is an reliably accurate, for it is almost impossible to construct a flawless history of truth, record of a real life confrontation every bit as deserving of lore granted to earlier Greek legend. His admission that he himself suffered from the plague that ravaged Athens at the beginning of the war instantly made the text easier to read. It was at this point I fully came to realize this book had been written as the events unfolded, or at least heavy notes were taken for later reference, rather than after as Herodotus had done. There is just something so remarkable about a first hand account in real time from an active participant in the events told. Fully engrossed, I read Thucydides quicker than any other Greek text I have studied. Do not be put off then by this supposed dryness of his style. Personally I do not believe in it at all. He is obviously trained somewhat in the skills of oratory, as his speeches imply, and there is nothing better to read in my opinion than a historcal account made by someone with a distaste for falsity. It is no more difficult to read that Herodotus, and in all ways just as fascinating. The one obvious criticism, is that the work remains unfinished. Since the final defeat of Athens is indeed one of shocking events for such a glorious power, I would give anything for the account to be completed in full. Still, it is illogical to study Greek history without reading Thucydides, and if I could restart my studies I undoubtably would have started with him first rather than last. 
I really have the feeling that I am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the Thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work. Instead, this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text. First, the text is daunting. Be patient with it, and put it down if you need to. It pays off. I'm not someone who reads battle scenes with absorption, and still I found that if I absorbed the text in small enough doses, then I was able to follow with interest. Second, use the appendices at the back. The explanations about the Spartan and Athenian Leagues, the Greek monetary system, and the Melian dialogues were actually quite helpful in places for reading the text. These appendices are provided in the Penguin edition of the Thucydides. Third, take notes. There are a lot of big thoughts, and I found that I absorbed them better by writing them down for myself to think about later. It is time-consuming to attempt the History of the Peloponnesian War. It is also worth it, to my mind. I got a lot out of reading it even without being a historian with expertise in the time and region. Give it a try, and give it the space that it deserves. "So it is now reasonable for us to hope that the gods will be kinder to us, since by now we deserve their pity rather than their jealousy. 
This book illustarted how Greek people were disunited and enagged in war with one another. At the end of this book, author mentioned how Persian/Iranian were commenced to interfer in Greek politics 
Thucydides (c.460-c.400 BC) was an insider during the Peloponesian War. He was an Athenian commander who was dismissed after his men lost a battle in spite of the fact of his previous successes. This book was an attempt at an honest historical assessment of the Peloponesian War which was not only destructive to the Athenians and eventually the Spartans, but the war was also ruinous to their allies. The important theme of this book is that Athenian hubris replaced practicle thinking leading to Athenian imperialism and war. Thucydides investigated this war by examining battle sites, interviewing both Athenian and Spartan commanders, and inspecting the limited sources that existed for historians at that time. He was clear that the primary cause of the Peloponesian War was fear of Athenian imperialism especially among the Spartans and their allies. One should note that the Athenians not only made enemies of the Peloponeisan League (The Spartans and their allies), but the Athenians made enemies of those Greeks who were neutral but were driven by necessity to join the Peloponesian League. An important part of theis book which is found in the Penguin Classics edition can be found on pages 242-244. Thucydides made some poignant remarks regarding how thought and language are corrupted during times of revolution and war. He comments that manners and civility collapsed during the Peloponesian War. He also warned readers that during such crises that thoughtful, intelligent men are destroyed because too many people are willing to commit violence on behalf of demogogues rather than engage in calm reflection. This is in line with the chapter on Von Hayek's THE ROAD TO SERFDOM titled "Why the Worst get on top." If one follows Thucydides THE HISTORY OF THE PELOPONESIAN WAR carefully, they will discover that the Athenians had considerable power and wealth. Yet, Athenian arrogance and greed resulted in a useless war that resulted in the loss of Athenian power and wealth. This book is a microcosm of the adage that, "The bigger an empire is, the weaker it is." This book is useful in examination of the catostophic wars and revolutions of the 20th century. George Orwell made comment on the corruption of language in his essays and novels, expecially 1984. Crane Briton cites Thucydides' book in Briton's book title ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION. In other words, while this book was written c. 410 B.C., this book is still timely which makes it a classic 
Why should we take an interest in a war that happened four centuries before the birth of Christ? It is because this disastrous 27-year war between Athens and Sparta had a major impact on the development of the Western world. It finally ended in 404 B.C.E., and recent evidence suggests that Athens finally succumbed not to force of arms, but to typhoid. The result of the war was to put an end to hopes of Greek unification, and it was only a matter of time before the weakened Greek cities would fall victim to foreign conquest and lose the freedoms that were the vital essence of Greek civilization, and their greatest gift to the world. The triumph of Spartan oligarchy over Athenian democracy left a long shadow over the development of Western civilization. Thucydides is considered by many to be the first great critical Western historian. He was a wealthy Athenian who was born around 460 B.C.E. and died around the age of sixty. He is chiefly remembered for this important book, and for a few pithy epigrams and quotations: "History is philosophy teaching by examples;" and "Be convinced that to be happy means to be free and that to be free means to be brave. Therefore do not take lightly the perils of war." When the Peloponnesian War broke out, he is thought to have been about 28 or 29 years old, and rose to the rank of general before being exiled for his military failure at the Battle of Amphilpolis. In those days, military failure was counted a crime. This book is a meticulous chronicle of the disastrous war. Until this work, historians simply recorded events. But his was different: an attempt to find inside information from people on both sides, and to interpret some of the turning points of the whole war and some of the terrible decisions that ultimately changed history. There will always be squabbles about different translations and versions of a classic text, but this one is as good as they come, and well worth looking at for its insights into some of the events that fashioned our world 
Thucydides' "The History of the Peloponnesian War" is a wonderful source for any thoughtful study of Ancient Greek History. I'm proud to put this copy on my book shelf next to Homer, Herodotus and Catullus, all my favorite ancient writers. Thucydides writes for what is the first time an objective historical work. This, along with Herodotus, is the birth of History. Yet there are a couple of troubling problems with the translation. For one thing it is full of Cold War lingo that makes it hard not to draw connections from Athens and Sparta to the United States and the USSR. Phrases like "reactionary elements" are out of place and don't mesh well with the actual Greek. In addition the translator uses the word "empire" for the Greek word "arche". Now my Greek isn't the best but my dictionary tells me that arche means province or territory, or literally a place that is ruled over. Empire has a lot of strong emotions attached to it, and its not a good translation for "arche". Hence the translator adds an element that Thucydides didn't intend when he uses "Athenian Empire." Besides those elements it's a great translation. 
Few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece. This is one of them. Thucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native Athens is remarkable for it's candor, despite events that must have been tragically painful. The text includes legendary personalities (Pericles, Alcibiades, Demosthenes, Nicias, etc): their actions, words, and fate. Facts license readers to decide what's important, and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity. Who would have thought the promise of Persian defeat (told by Herodotus) would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved? Athens' distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic (given recent attempts to democratize the Middle East). Melos destiny at Athens' hands may give pause. As may the Syracuse expedition (especially Book Seven). I read Warner's translation thirty years ago (it was 50p then), and still turn to it from time to time. Also recommended: `The Landmark Thucydides' (Robert Strassler, Victor Davis Hanson). This is a volume for those willing to spend a bit more to obtain the history matched with maps and footnotes 
I first discovered Sean Steward in Perfect Circle, which is his best book to date in my not-so-humble opinion. This one comes close though. In this book, like Perfect Circle, Stewart writes in a way that is very readable and occasionally drops in such clever and well-written phrases and sentences that I actually stepped back and appreciated the writing skill as well as the story. That is not to say that you lose your immersion in the story, and it is not to say that he is wordy or pretentious. Just the opposite. It is prose that is a delight to read. The story is interesting, but it is the characters that will drive you to the end. That is Stewart's strength. He writes people you are interested in knowing more about. In a nutshell, I'd recommend Perfect Circle and Mockingbird as a pair - great reading 
Go to the "look inside the book" function above, and click on "excerpt;" that takes you to the first page of Sean Stewart's Mockingbird. (You can also get there through the "intro pages" links.) Read the first paragraph. If you're hooked, like I was, you'll love this book. Like me, you may instantly flip to the bio to check the author's gender. Sean, Sean, isn't that a guy's name? And is he really writing from the first-person perspective of a woman who, the book's first sentence makes plain, gets pregnant in the course of the story? Yep. And most of the other main characters are women, too. This is a high-wire act, and boy does Stewart pull it off. I found his characters and their magical-realist situation very believable, and he writes with style, and humor that's richer than wit or cleverness. I can't say I'm surprised by any of that, except the first-person thing. What brought me to Mockingbird is, of all things, Stewart's entry into franchise fiction: his book Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, a Star Wars novel set very shortly before the upcoming movie "Episode III: Revenge of the Sith." I've read dozens of Star Wars novels, and this is one of my two or three favorites, again for how Stewart fleshes out characters' inner lives and for the color in his writing. (The book feels like he had a *great* time writing it.) I'm going on about it at length here to bring it to the attention of Stewart fans who might not otherwise try a Star Wars novel. If you saw Ep.II in 2002 and plan to see Ep.III, try it out. You don't need any more background than that, and it'll enhance your enjoyment of Yoda, Count Dooku, and the movies' other characters 
This book is top notch, the character development is fantastic and the story so real that it turns into a roller coaster of emotions.... Top Notch 
I really enjoyed this book, zombie frogs, voodoo Riders, and all the perils and tribulations possible while being pregnant when I wasn't pregnant yet. After getting pregnant, though, man, it's *really* funny and it's really obvious that the man did some real research into the problems. Mockingbird is more easy going than some of Stewart's other books, warmer, funnier, and much more involved with the everyday things that go with someone's life with all the complexities, absurdities, and joy that goes with it. It still has that touch of magic he brings to everything, and I highly recommend it 
Left-handers know they have it tough in the world, but for all those non-believing right-handers, this is the book you need to read. It is a thorough examination of left-handedness, including word origins, derivations of "left is evil" myths, famous left-handers, relevant anatomy, historical and cultural concessions to right-handers, and even a list of retail stores who cater to southpaws. Very well-done all the way around 
I really liked LEFT IS RIGHT because it provided excellent information for lefties, ranging from humorous anecdotes and helpful history to easily understood explanations for why people are left-handed...and lists and lists of famous lefties. Right on! for this special book for lefties 
I enjoyed reading Rae Lindsay's book. I really like her writing style. It was a light read and anyone interested in lefties should read this book! 
I enjoyed reading Rae Lindsay's book. I really like her writing style. It was a light read and anyone interested in lefties should read this book! 
It's about time someone wrote a great book for us lefties! WOW! This book is so fun to read and is so informative that I would recommend it to anyone. Yes, even right-handers! You can't imagine how much cool and interesting stuff is packed into this book 
This is a great introduction to economics that ranks up there with Hayek's "Road to Serfdom". 
This book is usually listed by free-market advocates as one of the five books to read first. Henry Hazlitt writes with unequaled clarity. He outlines that basics of many fundamental ideas--the price system, inflation, government subsidies, minimum wage, and others. He uses pure logic and reasoning almost exclusively, only providing statistics as sidenotes to the main point. However, the book's strength is also its weakness. While he makes a tremendous intellectual defense of free market economics, it by no means complete. I would recommend this to any beginning libertarian or free market advocate; it will provide many strong points for further contemplation and research. However, a Keynesian advocate will still be able to question certain ideas. Yet, any intellectually honest statist should read it, because Hazlitt does present his arguments cogently, clearly, and with power. One note: a more seasoned free market economist may wish to consider this book a medium priority, because it may be somewhat basic to someone familiar with classic arguments 
This book offers a very clear description of a subject that most people find dry and boring. Instead of referring to countless graphs and charts, Hazlitt manages to explain his assertations using common sense and language that a non-economist can easily understand. This is that same format of the monthly newsletter 'Ideas on Liberty', published by the Foundation for Economic Education, which aims to improve the understanding of economics among laypeople(The Foundation has long been a supporter of Hazlitt). One interesting thing to note is that Hazlitt was not formally trained as an economist, and I believe that's one of the reasons that he is able to state all these concepts succintly with no confusion. Even more amazing is that the same policies that he speaks against and that have failed are being tried again, with nothing more that a different name and some other minor changes. For those who think economics has to be confusing, I wholeheartedly recommend this book 
I don't go into the plots of books when I review them as many have already done so. I always look forward to another James Lee Burke novel, and Pegasus Descending does not disappoint. Dave Robicheaux is one of my favorite protagonists -- a man who is not perfect, has his weaknesses, but always tries to do the right thing. I highly recommend the Dave Robicheaux series 
One of the best writers of environment and character descriptions, Burke just gets better and better to the point that I can smell the air after a rain storm in New Iberia thanks to the way he puts it. Colors in his landscapes come to life in my mind's eye as though I were there. I've read nearly all of Burke's work. Pegasus ranks among the best 
I loved it. Recently took a trip to New Orleans, and a side trip to New Iberia to see the area he so fondly writes about 
No one paints a better picture of South Lousiana than James Lee Burke. JLB creates a wonderful canvas of Louisana politics, wildneress and attitudues. I am a Michigan native that now lives in South Lousiana and have fallen in love with every book he writes. This book, like every other Robicheaux novel, has left me starving for more. Don't you love books that you hate to finish 
As near as I can determine, I have read everything by James Lee Burke that is in print. Though his prose continues to captivate me, his latest novel is not one of my favorites. I am confused about how both Dave and Cletus are portrayed, and Dave's relationship with his latest wife also baffles me. I plan to reread this book after some time has passed (as is my custom with all of Burke's books) and see if the problems I think are there have been resolved by some subconscious mental wanderings in the interim 
I always know what to expect from Burke and his protagonist, Dave Robichaux. I am occasionally disappointed by the plot sameness of it, but the quality is always there. Dependable...yes, I suppose that is the very best description of both author and character. I will unquestionably buy the next Dave Robichaux book Burke writes...and the one after that...and the one after that...and will probably complain about the book's similarities to its predecessors, but I will certainly enjoy catching up with my old friend Dave 
I have read virtually all of James Lee Burke's novels, and this one is right up there with the best of them. Highly recommended 
James Lee Burke! Anything written by him is a joy to read, but I especially love his Robicheaux novels. This one is no exception. I anxiously await his future novels. His writing is pure poetry. I recommend all of his books; try to read the Robicheaux novels in order. You won't be sorry for the money or time spent on Burke's books 
This book is for lovers of Robicheaux. His demons seem put to rest, redemption seems almost within his grasp - and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages. The poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade Burke's prose as always, but his anger at humanity's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface. Hurricane Katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing. A bit like Robicheaux himsel 
A highly recommended book. An amazing and interesting information is revealed here. Learn how to grow, to master the game, and to think like the millionaire. This book is helpful and comprehensive, try to follow it, you might start a new life 
Of all of the self help/ how to prosper books I have ever read Eker's should have been the first. It is the quintessential foundation of prosparity 
I bought this Audio CD looking for that one NEW concept that changes the way I think about money/risk/living in general. I found many more than one, plus I've listened to it 3 times in the two days I had it, audio CDs are great for that! If your looking for business ideas or investment advice you're not really going to get it here. I did disagree with his comments on buying real estate at any means (as an investor, one should only buy real estate property at zero or positive cashflow or they should move on to the next property). A great real estate investment book the is Weekend Millionaire's Guide to Real Estate investing and the Mindset book (amazing books!). He talks about the MINDSET you have to have to take the ACTIONS despite of your FEARS. Futhermore, he elaborates on the following. Your THOUGHTS determine your FEELINGS and your feelings determine what you DO. DOING translates your desires, visualizations, etc... into reality. The biggest thing I got out of this book is the following warning: "I already know that" is what most people, especially poor people say in most aspects of their life and don't further educate themselves in a topic. Rich people are always learning and applying what they learn. If you have read 1000+ books on money, investing, whatever you want in life and you don't have the results you want its two things. One, you're MINDSET is not right for that task and you DON'T UNDERSTAND what those books were saying. If you did UNDERSTAND, you would be taking all the ACTIONS spelled out and like SCIENCE your life would reflect them (CAUSE and EFFECT). Notice how I said YOU and not blameing outter circumstances for your financial situation. Great book, Add to Cart! 
Harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be, and I was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end....and found out there was nothing. Just a worthless rant 
Loved the book so much, now my husband and I are going to his 3 day seminar 
Eker has to be respected for his accomplishments.The transformed mind has to go before the transformed Bank account. But, my personal preference is the exhaustive and more systematic presentations that Brain Tracy makes. Eker is probably a very motivating speaker! Having said that he gets 4 stars because it is a classic book/CD. It needs to be in every millionare library 
Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
I received this book the next day and I tell you I could not put it down. It is the most inspiring, the most intriquing book I have ever read. Great job on the book. 
Exposure to Harv Eker's Millionaire Mind Intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago. I also attended the Guerilla Business School, a $2500 intensive. What is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually (as it did with me) shift your perspective, if you are at all open to having it shifted. Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones. This book may help you, but the seminar will help you more. The Millionaire Mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me. I am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called ZeroDollarMarketer dot com. Being rich is a matter of perspective. True wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind, my relationships, and lastly my pocketbook. But its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month. A journey worth pursuing 
I cannot claim to be an expert in the wealth creation literature outside the US, but I am inclined to think that the principles are the same everywhere. What is so unique about the US is that the system allows the distribution of knowledge in a manner more efficient than the distribution of wealth, all based on the principle of self determination and achievement. Another reason that americans also lead the way in enterpreunarialship is because of the pragmatism they assume on psychological issues. Pragmatism based on the fundamental premise- the truth is utility. So no elaborated theories of the mind, just pragmatic analogies that will guide you through. I fully agree with a reader who said- if you keep on studying how to get rich material for 50 years, your expertice will be in that, but not in action- yet you cannot achive action unless your know your mind will be there helping you. Yes, your mind can be your greatest obstacle to wealth no matter if you work your finger to the bone night and day; amd herv helps you to do this. I must say this has been a most promising complement to the rich-dad series, for it goes into the inner structure of the mind that rich dad had. To the cynic who asks, are you a millionare already? no, but Im on my way.. and that a hell of a lot I can say compared to where I was last year 
This excellent book deals mostly with the many ways in which NAFTA is ruining all the countries involved. Although the description of the problem seems fairly accurate, the book disappoints somewhat by not mentioning some stronger cures, the strongest and most corrective of which is socialism 
I suspect that many Americans might be intimidated by the title of this book. Americans are told not to think in terms of conflicting class interests; after all, most people are supposedly middle class. Critiques of the wealthy and powerful are seen as expressions of envy, or of antique Stalinist, hippy, or New Deal thinking. In my opinion Jeff Faux does us all a valuable service by trying to revive the debate about the political nature of our world and its implications for our current lives and for our future. His writing is energetic and fresh; this is no dull social science text! At the same time, he presents a lot of evidence in making his arguments, reflecting thorough and careful scholarship. This is no simple partisan account; for example, chapter seven on NAFTA presents is hard-hitting in its critique of the alleged benefits of free trade, but the reader gets the feeling that Faux is basing his analysis on what his data revealed about its complex impacts on the majority of Americans, Canadians, and Mexicans. Overall, whether you are in America or Armenia, you will be entertained and provoked by Faux's writing 
The title appears borrowed from Sam Marcy's original work in 1979 on "The Global Class War and the Destiny of American Labor," but then, no one wanted to listen in the 1970's, when I did my first master's degree, to the three major themes in the political science literature: 1) Limits to Growth and need for Ecological Economics (Club of Rome, Herman Daly); 2) Global Reach of Multinational Corporations and the Home-Host Country Issues and Threats to Domestic Labor and Social Welfare (Barnett) 3) Need for World Government to address global issues (Falk). This book is valuable for its one main point reiterated and documented over and over again: the American elite has joined with other elites world-wide to reach accommodations that favor the investors and the ruling elites over the individuals that are employees. If I had not also read William Greider's "The Soul of Capitalism" as well as John Perkins, "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man" and (over two decades ago), Lionel Tiger, "The Manufacture of Evil," I might have seen this book in a different light. In the larger context of the 700+ books I have reviewed at Amazon, this book sums up a key factor that the public must consider when going to elect its leaders over the next few years. As the author documents and discusses, the combination of neoliberalism and neo-conservatism has led to government being in the service of corporations and the wealthy, rather than the public and especially the working public. The author suggests, citing another author, that the working class is 62% of America, the middle class 36%, and the ruling class 2%. He also notes that America is no longer a mobile society, with 77% of the people "stuck" in their parent's rut, and with wages now BACK to where they were in the 1970's--in other words, no real gains in quality of life or purchasing power across the land. The author spends a great deal of time on NAFTA, and his views are all negative. He is passionate on the topic of Mexico being a socio-economic bomb waiting to explode, and on how NAFTA and the deliberate tolerance of illegal immigration have essentially served as a pressure value, where the US imports poverty from Mexico in order to keep it from a worse explosion. The author is quite provocative when he examines the "rescue" of Mexico by Secretary of the Treasury Rubin. He "follows the money" and discovers that the U.S. taxpayer did not bail out Mexico per se, but rather Goldman Sachs and all the other investors in Mexico, investors who were supposed to evaluate risk and take risk and accept the consequences, but instead used their Goldman Sachs brother in arms to bail them out at taxpayer expense. Today of course President Bush has just appointed another Goldman Sachs leader to be Secretary of the Treasury (after the more honest Paul O'Neil resigned when he discovered that Vice President Dick Cheney was making all the policies without regard to the Cabinet process (see my review of "The Price of Loyalty.") The author is compelling in discussing how the Reagan Revolution broke the backs of the labor unions and also broke up the postwar social safety nets. The author discusses how there is no corporate mind-set that puts the home country, the USA, first. He discusses at length how we are coming off decades during which multinational corporations, aided and abetted by their class collaborators in government and the media, have essentially broken the social contracts with each country's public, and disconnected their global investments from any social benefit for labor. The author is very illuminating when he points out that it is NOT China that is flooding the US with cheap goods, but rather Wal-Mart and Wall Street, investing US dollars in China to leverage low-cost Chinese labor while off-shoring jobs and driving both salaries and quality down across the board within the USA where Wal-Mart has been proven to destroy small businesses for 50-100 miles around any one of its main stores (see my review of both the DVD and the book). The author is an optimist and an idealist, and I will end my review with a quote that I hope a future enlightened President will support. The author says on page 246: "To this end, a conference, or congress, of North American civil society, state and local officials and representatives of labor, and small businesses, should be held every year. One of its functions would be to do a public review of the state of continental integration and to discuss, debate, and make proposals for the future." I am reminded of Falk's genius in knowing in the 1970's that we would one day need global council for both religions and peoples. Government has failed to be just or to represent the public. This book comes at a good time. In America, November 2006 is a necessary pre-requisite to electoral reform and getting an honest wise President and a Coalition Cabinet in 2008. To do that, enough people have to vote so as to defeat the extremist Republican skill at stealing elections that are close. It has to be a landslide. 
A well written book that confirms books I was writing (till my power supply blew out.) In general, the author goes over how the shallow rich are oppressing the the world in order to acquire more wealth and maintain it. The only problem I found with this book is that the author uses complicated and hard to understand setences sometimes, which no doubt he does to show off his high eduction as a defense against others with a high education. In other words to show he isn't just some dumb wanderer off the street. But his use of hard sentences hurts his book in that it will make it harder for younger persons to undersand and people who don't understand some of the uncommon terminology he uses 
From a George Bush perspective, I read. Hence, I must be a Revolutionary. But for me reading is essentail. In Rafael's book, "Scaramouche", the establishment games the system by dueling the people's representatives with their skillfully commissioned swords. They literally kill the people's will. Today's fait accomplis are the skillfully commissioned penned instruments called NAFTA and WTO. The perpetrators behind these instruments were a political crew of bloodsuckers. On the American side they included: Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton, Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Al Gore and Henry Kissinger. These penned agreements were inserted with poison pills designed to adversely effect constitutiions throughout the world, including ours. But you'll never hear a discouraging word about them from the corporate mainsteam news. Get the REAL down and dirty of globalization and read "THE Global Class War". Read it and weep... for those you had placed your trust in, and to the republic they signed off on. Learn to distinguish between the interests of stateless transnationals and we the people whose economic fate is bounded by the nation. The poor class has already lost what little they had. Now the middle class is in the cross hairs and slowly being squeezed out. Unfortunately, they have taken us all aboard their hellbound corporate express called the bottom line. A must read for those who want the truth. 
Faux has done a really smashing job in bringing many threads into a coherent picture. The witless rightwing reviewer who invoked Hayek, von Mises, etc., wretched wonks of the right and economic Darwinists all, did not even know what book he was reviewing - typical of the right. The idea of transnational elites, who screw their own countrymen, is not new. The way in Faux ties this to comtemporary economics, social movements and politics, is different and far more perusuading than the usual "the aliens have taken over the elites" junk available today. The US has built its own pit, and still does not know when to stop digging. The corporations built a massive megaphone for the Right and scared the Left to death with threats. Fear is the currency of the day in any discussion about the future. We have a bunch of sheep in the Congress and confused, frightened polity which is seized with the distractors which have been provided: religion, abortion, immigration, homosexuality, etc., all bunk. Above all, Faux point about the diminishing corporate investment in the US, in research, development, education, health, etc. is a clear sign that the use of the transnationals if over, if but for the current era. They have tolerated the insanity of the Bush regime since they dont really care, even if the US creates illegal and immoral wars -- which again distract us while the corporations go on about their business. The US has been under assault by the corporations for some 40 or so years, and has now bought out the infrastructure designed to stop this massive taking of ecomonic and legal power. The price of our stupidity and cupidity in taking our eye off the real wolf is our being devoured 
Explaining their own economic self-interest to blue-collar, redneck republicans is a bit easier than explaining geometry to gophers. All it takes is infinite time and patience. This book makes a valiant attempt to educate redneck republicans. 
The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published 
I find this book just a bit disjointed. Its main thesis seems to be that the FAFTA agreements were basically a fraud perpetrated upon the American worker by a global elite. Mr. Faux sees a class war going on with this global elite (who he calls the 'Party of Davos,' from the town of Davos Switzerland where a conference is held each year) operating to their own benefit to the harm of the American worker. The question he doesn't answer is, if NAFTA is taking away all these American jobs, why is the unemployment rate in the US so low. I even saw a sigh across town that McDonalds was paying $10 an hour in an attempt to get more people. Second I worked for a company that did a lot of design work in Taiwan. It was a Chinese company, and they had a team of Chinese engineers. They did good work. Buying a computer motherboard from them was about half of buying one made in the US. Would you really be willing to pay twice as much for your PC just to have it made in the US? The product would be no better, just made here. And doesn't the Chinese engineer, bright, educated, hard working, deserve a future as well? Finally Mr. Faux, ignoring China, India and the rest of the developing countries, says that he would like to see an expansion of the North American treaties to perhaps even have Canada and Mexico join the US in one country. I've never met a Canadian who wanted to join the US. This is an interesting book, worth reading just to get his point of view. But I'm afraid that I don't see what he wants happening very soon 
According to Jeff Faux, erstwhile president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington DC, with the enfeebled nation-state and the absence of world government, the 2,000 plus people who manage and own the worlds largest multinational corporations meet every year at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland to set the agenda for the global economy. Even though the event includes political leaders, academics, journalists, and an occasional movie star, they are mere window dressing accompanying the real movers and shakers. This elite is what Faux calls the "Party of Davos." There is no countervailing party other than the World Social Forum which celebrates the likes of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro, but they are of no consequence in the real order of things. The Party of Davos is primarily the party of international global investors, who do their best to promote globalization and free trade. Elites around the world have bought into it, including the leadership of both the Democratic and Rebublican parties in the US, with the expectation that globalization would raise all economic boats, or so they would have us believe. However, this has not happened. Faux correctly points out that prior to the age of globalization the US economy was more or less self-contained, and capital and labor were forced to deal with each other, thereby creating a social contract from which all parties benefited. What was once good for GM was also good for America; now it is only good for GM. (This may not be a good example since even the global investor is not happy with GM.) The point being that GM can now find cheaper labor and lower environmental standards in other countries. Faux argues persuasively that globalization went astray with the Nafta agreement, which was supposed to protect workers and the environment in the US, Mexico, and Canada. Instead, thanks to the Clinton administration, multinational corporations were given a free hand in overriding those very protections. It's almost as if Ross Perot's "giant sucking sound" pulling high-wage jobs out of the US has been realized. Moreover, ten years and a WTO later, that giant sucking sound is pulling those jobs out of the entire Nafta block and ending up in China and India. The result is that workers' wages and middle-class living standards from all three Nafta countries have declined under "free trade". Again Faux reminds us that rich countries have poor people and poor countries have rich people. The rich or the investor class in all countries have prospered whereas the middle-class and the poor have seen their fortunes decline. To compound this problem, the US trade deficit was $726 billion last year and there is no evidence that it will decline in the future. Our manufacturing base is being hollowed out and the so-called knowledge economy is being outsourced. The primary job creation since the year 2000 has been in healthcare, government, finace, and the low-wage service sector. If this trend continues, it will become impossible to export our way out of this deficit, unless there is a significant devaluation of the dollar, which will inevitably lower our standard of living. This is going to happen no matter what policy is adopted in the near future, it is only a question of how much of a less prosperous future we will have. Pat Buchanan in a recent article entitled "Our Hollow Prosperity" makes the same argument as Faux and indeed cites statistics from the Economic Policy Institute. Buchanan does not couch the argument in terms of class struggle (my main quibble with Faux's thesis), but he does believe when corporations are given the oppurtunity to find cheaper labor abroad they will do so and that the current free trade policy is undermining our prosperity. With the left and the right finding common cause against the corporate and political elite, there should be a significant political realignment when the next economic downturn hits. What does Faux recommend? He is calling for a new global - or at least a regional, Nafta-wide - social contract. It looks something like managed trade. Let's face it, the economies that are running a surplus with us are practising managed trade. We should start bargaining for greater access to their markets and place a higher bar of entry to ours. Faux is not advocating protectionism, just smart policy instead of none at all. We can now see the trajectory of globalization: Thomas Friedman proclaimed that it created a global and level playing field in the job market for workers heretofore excluded; Clyde Prestowitz proclaimed that the playing field was tilted against the industrialized world because our high wage requirements put us at a disadvantage; now Jeff Faux is saying that all workers are being sold short and that it's time to create a global social contract. Who says there is no such thing as progress 
For a dog behaviour professional, this book and its companion volume have to be the most useful and important resource around. Not for the casual dog owner, but then that's not the target market. A wealth of material, well presented and organised, and without bias. Now when's the one on behaviour modification coming out??!! 
I would give this book five stars if it weren't for the level of difficulty in reading it...just had to take off a star for that reason alone. This isn't the book for the first time dog owner or casual trainer. It's a serious book for the well-versed student of dog behavior and training. Mr. Lindsay definitely knows what he's talking about but the reader must already have a fairly good grasp of the "concepts" behind his explanations in order to fully understand the material. It was a good read that I had trouble putting down, though! If you're serious about learning the more advanced concepts and principles in dog behavior and training, the book is well laid out and informative to the max 
Absolutely amazing -- full of clear, well-outlined and detailed information, much of which I had previously not known or failed to appreciate its significance and relevance. Even a professional could benefit 
I wish someone could have given me this book when my daughter was born in June 2005. I had a hard time finding information that deals with specific issues relating to Babies with Down Syndrome 
I had recently found out that my future grandchild was diagnosed with Down Syndrome and was anzious to start educating myself. The book helped me understand the syndrome and realize that we need not be afraid of what the future holds. Since then I have found out that this baby will probably not go full term, but what I read made me realize that I should not be afraid of hearing Down Syndrome in the future. 
I was given a copy of this book when my son, Zachary was born. As another reviewer mentioned, it was quite scary reading all the things that MIGHT be wrong with him medically, along with the quotes from parents the author included. I'm sure the quotes were a well-meaning inclusion from the author - but each and every one I would review to be extremely non-descript, even bordering negative. As a parent of a child with DS - I can tell you first-hand that my experience has been nothing but non-descript...but overwhelmingly positive. My son, at less than 2 years old, has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others. A child with Down Syndrome is a blessing in disguise. He give to me so much more than I give to him as you wil hear from just about ANY parent with a DS child - but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book. 
As a professional I found this book to offer a lot of basic information that a family could understand about down syndrome. All the children I work with with Down Syndrome, their families have this book and said it helped them so much 
I received a copy of this book from my son's occupational therapist. I was ready to know more about my son's condition and to know why he would do somethings instead of others. I wanted to know how the milestones varied from "healthy" children. I felt this book covered everything that I wanted to know and even discussed what to do when writing a will and how it changes with a Down Syndrome child. Things I never would have thought would be different until reading this book. It took about 4 months before I was willing to read something about this because I wanted to start raising him just like I raised my other children. This was definitly a book that did not go the extreme in the condition which is something I wanted. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who has a child with Down Syndrome 
I am an early interventionist, working with several infants and children who have Down syndrome. I found this book to be somewhat incomplete and misleading. For example, it contains a developmental milestone chart for typically developing children. This chart caused no end of worry to the parents I work with. More accurate, Down syndrome specific information is available elsewhere. 
I was given this book by the Richmond Down Syndrome Society when our daughter was born with Down Syndrome. It was quite a shock as we did not know she would be born with DS. I knew right away when she was placed in my arms (I'm a special education teacher)and within 20 hours of birth she was whisked away to the Medical College of Virginia. This book was so very helpful to both myself, my husband and my family. We all learned so much from it and we passed it along to my brother (her guardian in the event something were to happen with us) and his wife. They also found it helpful as they knew what to expect. Overall, I cannot stress enough that these children are so wonderful in their own way and this book helps to give you an inside view of what to expect with your new baby. 
We were told, in the delivery room, that our son had down syndrome. That was not what upset us, it was the pediatric specialist telling us all the bad things that "would happen" to our son. We were desperately looking for information on D.S., but nothing was really clear that we saw on line. Our doctor at Child Development had this book so we went to Borders and got it. It is written in a way that makes it easier for someone to understand all the possibilities. Basically, a D.S. child can do anything as long as he/she has the opportunity and support. Our first hurdle was the V.S.D., he had heart surgery at 4 months as he was unable to put on weight or even keep the weight he had gained. He has gained 7 pounds and is 7 months. We play with him all the time in ways to develope his muscle tone and his P.T. says, in one month, he has done a major improvement. We cross each bridge as it comes but we make it fun. We constantly us the book for reference when we have a question or need a clarification, it is always on our kitchen table 
In the delivery room when my son Mikey was born, we were told he had Down syndrome. We knew very little about the condition and were confused and frightened about the future. Our son's geneticist gave us a copy of this book and it answered almost all of our questions, including some we never thought to ask. The information in this book relieved many of our fears and showed us how to be the best parents for our son. The book starts with a forward by Ann M. Forts, a member of the Board of Directors of the National Down Syndrome Congress; the New Hampshire Developmental Disabilities Council; and the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. Ms. Forts also happens to be a person with Down syndrome. Right away, we knew this book was going to be positive! The book starts with a chapter on what is Down syndrome followed by a chapter on adjusting to your new child. Chapter 3 discusses some of the medical issues that are associated with Down syndrome. This is good information to be aware of even if you never need it. The next few chapters discuss taking care of your baby, family life, how your baby will develop, early intervention, and educating the child with Down syndrome. The last chapter covers your legal rights. Every chapter has several pages of short quotes from parents. It helped to lessen the fear and stress to read that other parents are coping. This is by far the best book for the new parent of a child with Down syndrome. Before you read anything else, you will want to read this book 
The Amazing Beginning Of You is a straightforward introduction to the young reader about the miracles of conception, pregnancy, and birth from a Christian perspective. Color photographs reveal the incredible process of maturing from a zygote to a baby about to be born. The act of insemination (and human sexuality per se), is not explained or detailed in The Amazing Beginning Of You, which only briefly alludes to the role of the father in providing sperm. The focus is on presenting the creation of human life as a wonder granted by God. The Amazing Beginning Of You is an excellent and recommended book for Christian parents to answer the question: "Where do babies come from? 
Jean Shepard contributed to our culture with the stories that resulted in "A Christmas Story." He's hard to dislike, for that work alone. Here, though, you get more exposure to Jean's other side. He is cynical, and not all that charming about it. He stereotypes, and it reminds us of how we used to be about assuming traits in people based on their race or ethnic origin. He excuses a lot of pretty bad behavior and, worse, expects us to agree with him that it is cute. Well, that's the bad stuff. The good stuff is that he still has a grasp of American rhythym that's hard to find most places. You will enjoy his fresh view of our experiences, and, if you overlook your potential reactions like the foregoing paragraph describes, you'll hear an authentic descriptive voice which is now gone 
And watch them live it this spring. I was introduced to this book by my High School English teacher 30 years ago. It was hilarous then. I have just given it to my own 16 year old son in gleeful anticipation of him living the prom ritual this year 
I made the mistake of reading this on an airplane once. I almost had an aneurysm trying to stifle my laughter. This is a book that you'll read over and over. Only, be forewarned; you'll have to buy multiple copies--once you lend it to a friend, you'll never see it again 
This little gem of a book will have you chuckling outloud. Based on his life, author Jean Shepherd spins yarns of past loves, family vacations, top playing, and the awkwardness of growing up in a less-than-privileged part of town. You will connect with some stories, shake your head at others, and burst out laughing at most 
This is one of the funniest books ever written. Jean Shepherd recounts his early years in a steelmill and oil refinery town in northern Indiana. The time is the late 1930's to 1940's. There is a sensible mother, a good-hearted father with an incredible vocabulary of cuss words, and a younger brother with an amazing ability to whine. We begin with the arrival next door of the Bumpus family, slovenly hillbillies with a million dogs that send our hero's father into explosions of outrage. We go through disaster after disaster until we reach the ultimate when our hero takes Wanda Hickey to the high school prom. I laughed so hard that I difficulty reading. Shepherd's mastery of description of small-town America in the 1940's is a pleasure to read, and it never stops being outrageously funny 
It was the summer of 1967, and I was parking cars at a posh L.A. apartment house, waiting to be sent to basic training, then off to Vietnam. About three in the morning, I picked up a Playboy Magazine. Amazingly, it had fallen open to a short story called 'Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories' by Jean Shepherd. It was then, and remains today, the funniest story I have ever read. It's the reigning champ, with warm recollections of Jean's grimy midwestern steel town, his cronies and the biggest night in most of our adolescent lives -- the senior prom. If you've seen or read 'A Christmas Story', you'll enjoy the gradual, precise setup and hilarious payoff of 'Wanda.' I should mention that I write (and read) for a living in the automotive magazine business 
Very good in the sequel line, but I figured out "who dun it" before I finished. The characters are still developing well, waiting for the next one. I have the whole series. 
Boulder, Colorado author, Margaret Coel calls the wolf a wonderful animal. "It's always two looks ahead," of everybody else, she says. Using the wolf as metaphor, she gets the villain in her mystery novel THE EYE OF THE WOLF at least two looks ahead of both readers and main characters. The 11th in her series featuring the Boston Irish priest Father John O'Malley and Arapaho lawyer, Vicky Holden as the crime solvers, THE EYE OF THE WOLF takes the reader to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. There, traditional enemies, the Arapaho and Shoshone, share the land. Father John serves an Arapaho parish. Vicky works with an Arapaho law firm. The two are close friends. As EYE OF THE WOLF opens, someone has killed three Shoshone college students on the Bates Battlefield, where in 1874, Shoshone scouts led the United States Cavalry to an Arapaho village. The soldiers slaughtered everyone living there. Animosity between the Shoshone and Arapaho, two very different peoples with diverse cultures, has smoldered since. Father John fears the worst when he sees the latest bodies at Bates, all posed like dead warriors in old photographs. Someone wants to encourage the hatred. Why? And Who? He, his parishioners, and the police suspect Frankie Montana. This Arapaho trouble has often fought with Shoshones in bars,. Because he drifts around the reservation drinking and crashing at drug houses, most decent people of both groups despise Frankie. His mother, Lucille, begs Vicky to become Frankie's lawyer. Lucille believes he's innocent. Because Lucille is a friend, Vicky agrees to take the case. However, she, too, believes Frankie is guilty. He concern is to get him a fair trial. Frankie asserts he did not commit the crime, but will not talk to Vicky or the police. As he eludes them out of sheer terror of jail, Father John finds a fourth Shoshone victim at Bates. Looking at the evidence against Frankie, Vicky begins think he may not be the killer. So does Father John, after talking to people in the parish. But, then who is? Can Father John and Vicky find the person, and prove his or her identify to the police? Or--is the murderer like the wolf--two looks ahead ? Will that give him or her time to kill again? Worse, have Father John and Vicky made a mistake to believe Frankie? Is he really the killer? Will he prove it by shooting one of them? Their gamble on Frankie brings EYE OF THE WOLF to an end that one one could possibly expect. But the conclusion makes perfect sense, because Margaret Coel writes with understanding of Arapaho and Shoshone history. Through that history, she reveals the killer. Also through that history, she also makes EYE OF THE WOLF more than just another mystery with an explosive ending. As the story unfolds, she presents two Native American groups that get little attention from novelists. Working closely with people who live on Wind River Reservation, she makes sure her depiction is accurate. So EYE OF THE WOLF is not something like, or just like a wolf, it IS a wolf--two looks ahead of everybody. Readers will not only enjoy a gripping mystery, but they'll also learn something about other people and their lives. They'll receive the lesson through rich, well-developed and belleville characters, quirky little subplots, lively dialogue, and solid description of locale 
Margaret Coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and describes the Arapahoe customs in wonderful detail. In this installment, Father O'Malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians has been re-ignited, and that dead Indians can be found on an ancient battle ground. When Father O'Malley goes to investigate, he discovers three dead Shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles. Things heat up when the young Shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends. Vicky Holden, the other main character in the series, has entered into a law partnership with Adam Lone Eagle, and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling. Vicky wants to defend Frankie Montana, who is a suspect in the murders, and Adam tries to persuade her not to take Frankie as a client. As always, author Coel creates a wonderful setting and characters, and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series. 
It is hard to believe that Margaret Coel began her Wind River Reservation series some ten years ago with THE EAGLE CATCHER, which introduced readers to Father John O'Malley and defense attorney Vicky Holden. Each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between O'Malley and Holden. The latest installment in this series is no exception. EYE OF THE WOLF begins with a cryptic telephone message that is left for O'Malley on an answering machine. This leads him to the site of a historic battlefield, one that resulted in the slaughter of an Arapaho Indian village by U.S. forces, aided by Shoshone scouts. In modern times Arapahos and Shoshones are somewhat uneasy neighbors on the Wind River Reservation, with their antagonistic history providing a shadowy backdrop, gone but not entirely forgotten. But past differences are brought to the forefront when O'Malley discovers the bodies of three Shoshones on the old battlefield, positioned to mimic those of the dead killed in the historic battle. Frankie Montana, a chronic client of Holden's, is the primary suspect. Despite Montana's recidivistic tendencies, Holden does not believe he is capable of murder. It eventually becomes clear to Holden and O'Malley that someone is attempting to revive the long-dormant conflict between the Arapahos and Shoshones --- and that Holden has placed herself in terrible danger on behalf of her client. While Coel has created an extensive backstory contributing to the Wind River Reservation mythos, it is not necessary to read what has transpired before EYE OF THE WOLF. The tension between O'Malley and Holden builds from page to page, as they struggle to protect the innocent --- and each other --- from an unknown malefactor. At the same time, both are protective of O'Malley's priestly vows, even as their emotions practically --- but subtly --- beg for violation. EYE OF THE WOLF is an excellent introduction to the Wind River Reservation series, while providing a welcome return to the area and its people for longtime followers of the series. Given the longevity of these novels, it is clear that Coel can continue to explore this beautiful, dangerous landscape for as long as she wishes. Recommended. --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlau 
The poetic macabre message shakes up Father John O'Malley, the Jesuit Pastor at St. Francis on the Wind River Plantation. The caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths. Not long afterward, at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the Shoshone betrayed the Arapaho to the cavalry, three Shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here. Frankie Montana, who was seen recently arguing with the Shoshone and has quite a rap sheet is charged with the triple homicides. His lawyer Vicky Holden believes Frankie who insists he is innocent because she knows this low life would do just about anything but not murder. As she mounts a defense, she wonders if the culprit is cunningly trying to cause an Indian war between the two tribes for some unknown reason or a psychopath is avenging the century plus slaughter. The latest Wind River Reservation Mystery, EYE OF THE WOLF, is a fabulous legal thriller that uses brutal late nineteenth century carnage as the apparent motive to twenty-first century murders. The story line moves out rather quickly when Father O'Malley listens to the high pitched poetry of the killer on his voice machine and never takes a breather as Vicky tries to prove her client did not commit the crime though circumstantially he appears heading for the fall. Margaret Coel is at her best with this tale that affirms why so many readers feel she is the heir apparent to the Hillerman mantle. Harriet Klausner 
Eye of the Wolf by Margaret Coel ISBN: 0425205460 - Due out today (6 September 2005) - I was sent an ARC of this great book to read for review which I do gladly. I had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them, especially Spirit Woman and Story Teller, so was expecting good things. I was not disappointed - the series follows the adventures of Father John O'Malley, pastor of St. Francis Mission on the Wind River Reservation and tribal attorney, Vicki Holden and apart from a ripping good mystery, the author weaves the history of the Arapho and the Soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well, bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life. It is not hard to care about the "Indian priest" as they call Father John or Vicky Holden. I think what I enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well - they were brought vividly alive by the author's words. From the first mystery message "This is for the Indian priest", everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the 19th century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield - but does it?? This is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish. 
Carole Radziwill's memoir is an exquisite description of loving relationships, family expectations, and maintaining a marriage with constant threat of terminal illness. The book is written in a no-nonsense tone-as the tragic story of her husband's recurrent cancer unfolds, Carole never resorts to hyperbole. Interconnected themes are deftly strung together like pearls. Anthony Radziwill did not want others to know of his illness, and the weight of maintaining a pretense that all was well increased with each bad check-up. His deteriorating prognosis and certain death was never openly discussed, although his cousin, John Kennedy, tried to push Carole into doing so. What remains is a wonderful testament to Anthony Radziwill and John and Carolyn Kennedy, not because of what Carole Radziwill tells us, but because of how she tells their story. Radziwill's sentences shimmer and dance and wrap themselves around the reader. Her use of language is so masterful that the Radziwill/Kennedy names become mere background to the story of four young people whose hopes and dreams ended nearly as soon as they began. This book is beautifully written. 
I have read quite a few memoirs lately (The Tender Bar, The year of Magical Thinking, Million Little Pieces-part memoir)and by far this was the best one I read. I love Carole Radziwell's writing style and I found her story to be gutsy, emotional and truthful. As a person who watched a loved one die of cancer before my eyes I could totally relate to her feelings of frustration, helplessness and sadness. I can say their is nothing on earth worse than watching a love on deteriorate before your eyes and not able to save them. I had no idea of the relationship between her and the Kennedy family so i was very intrigued by her personal view of the family and the friendship. I felt she wrote this book with great respect for her husbands family revealing what she deemed approriate written with integrity. This was a magnificent first book and I look forward to reading more of her work. I highly recommend this book 
Just as I said in the title-- this is an amazing look at love and death and being in the spotlight when you enter that inner circle of the famous or society...not the infamous, not the instant celebs...but the inner circle of names that make America what it is...Carole Radziwill married "John John's" cousin, son of Lee radziwell (Jackie O's sister). And because of this she entered the inner Kennedy circle and coincidentally became one of Carolyn (John's wife) best friends....Some fascinating stuff here-- I think many of us assumed that Carolyn and Carole were both upper class-- they appear to have been middle class and even worked at the same department store in NYC at one time where they had to wear yellow aprons. Of course Carolyn worked in cosmetics dept and Carole worked in customer service...The fascinating part of this book is that Carole is able to somehow view both the yin and yang of her marriage and the relationship with the Kennedy family --especially John and Carolyn...Carole's husband gets cancer and is actually dying the week that John and Carolyn's plane crashes...Carole is the one who has to notify the Coasts Guard and Carolyn's family....It's a great book to read to show that you can be happy and sad at the same time. I appreciate her honesty-- she signed up for love and roses and got death and dying much of the time...now it's time for her to get her own life again...a former news researcher...she spent much of her married life taking care of a sick and/or dying husband and then dealing with the Kennedy tragedy too...fascinating book.. 
Those of us who have a story to share should do so, and this story is beautifully written; WHAT REMAINS is a unique one, worth telling, and would be even if it did not involve America's single most famous family. The details Carole Radziwill reveals are intimate, yet never give away more than those connected and still living would find intrusive. At times her pain is almost palpable, and she seems still slightly bewildered about her life and the tragic turn it took during the summer of 1999. The very fact that she did live it and came through it gives her every right to tell about it, and I am glad she chose to do so. 
This is not the memoir of Carole Radziwill. It is a memoir for each person who reads the moving story. You will find yourself comparing the scenes in this work with comparable things that have happened in your life and the lives of your family friends. You perhaps will find yourself viewing those captured in the tabloids in a little different light. But - most importantly - you will understand it is those "little" things that makes life worth living and leaves the memories that are timeless. 
In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?" After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love. While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place. As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way). I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever. 
I just finished the book last night, crying as I read the last few pages. I guess since Carole Radziwill and I are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down. It also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family. I felt like I knew Carolyn Bessette Kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press. She was a delightful and woman, filled with life, which makes her ending even more tragic. The book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by CANCER. It pays homage to Anthony Radizwill as well as John and Carolyn Kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde 
If anyone in this most famous dynasty has earned this title, she would be the one. Congrat's to Anthony, John. and Carolyn for recognizing true class, as it is a rarity. It speaks volumes about them!! Carole's courage and capacity to love will amaze. Her talent is another thing entirely. Off the charts!!! (Put aside some quiet time and a lot of kleenex!) 
I really enjoyed this book. This is a memoir, not a novel, which explains why reading it felt like reading a journal. I loved Carole's style of writing and the way she portrayed things. I think she wanted this to be just a story of friends, and not focus on WHO the friends were. I think she accomplished this. It did not feel like just another book about the Kennedy family. Even though I knew how the book would end, I cried. It was written so beautifully. 
This book was a disappointment. A real textbook would actually have instruction. This book is merely a collection of cases, with a few scattered chapters on VC/PE. Only buy the book if required to for a class 
This book provides a good overview of venture capital and buyout fund management. It addresses the investment process through four modules: fundraising, investing, exiting, and new frontiers. There are twenty nine chapters of which nine are instructional and the rest are case studies. Though there is information interspersed within the case studies, I think it would have been better to have had shorter case studies and longer instructional pieces to delve more deeply into subjects. 
A must for anyone wanting to know how VC firms work, structure themselves, and considerations for funding. This is an excellent case study that ought to be in a graduate program! It's as close as you'll get without working for a VC firm. I would suggest reading "The Venture Capital Cycle" first to get a general feel for VC and how it works. Then read the case study 
Want examples of how funding works? Want to know how Venture firms set up their business? Want to know everything about practical application of VC firms? This may be as close as you'll get without actually working in one. This ought to be a text book in graduate school. I'd suggest "The Venture Capital Cycle" as the first book to get an overview of VC's. Then, read this one and you'll be pretty proficient in terms of being an outsider. Great Case Study 
the author insists, so far as I can tell, that the only way to write a decent novel is based on some Aristotelean idea of the 'premise' which cannot be violated. 'Love leads to death' is an example for a character who dies as a result of being in love. This is nothing but an obscene simplification of the plot. It's absurdly reductionist. maximum capacity? A character's dialogue should always be the best thing he could say. What nonsense. How about the mistake, a common factor of life? Some good points on dialogue, though, but not worth the book. I think you could write a good novel with this book, but I think it would hobble a certain type of writer severely 
Let's be clear what we're buying here: an authoritative text on how to deploy character, crescendo, climax and theme in the idiom of the dramatic novel. Frey is covering the big picture, how skilled writers nurture the evolution of tensions through the work as a whole. His references to the classic canon of American fiction reinforce the message that these techniques are the essence of drama, and not just the stock in trade of pulp fiction. Understand, however, that Frey's book is not a complete manual for the novelist, or meant to be one. If it's the page-level micro-mechanics of novel-writing that you're interested in (dialogue, pacing, points of view), there'll be another book to buy. Frey bundles them into the final pages of "How to Write a Damn Good Novel", and they read like an afterthought 
How to Write a Damn Good Novel is billed as "a step-by-step no nonsense guide to dramatic storytelling." I don't know about the step-by-step part, but Frey's advice is definately no-nonsense and will help you create dynamic stories. I sat down to read this book with a packet of post-it notes by my side. I marked all the important points I thought I'd need to remember for later. At the end, I had a thick rainbow along the spine. I couldn't get more than 3 pages without finding some gem I just had to make sure not to forget. I think a lot of the other reviewers might be correct when they say this advice is not necessarily earth shattering and can be found else where. But there is a difference. Frey does it with more clarity, more punch. And why buy six writing books to get all the advice you can get in this one? I can't go wrong with this one. Even though I didn't agree with some of his advice, I still found his guide inspired me to write better and make my character sizzle. I have a lot of writing guides on my bookshelf, but this is one of my favorites 
This book has broken down all the elements that make a book a page turner - and a financial success! Although I have read other books on the subject of writing, I felt this one was much more practical, and was broken down to the point where anyone could understand it. I highly recommend this not just for new writers, but also for those experienced writers who need help on a specific aspect of their writing. You'll find it worth the price 
If your learning style is to learn a formula, then expand from there, then this is the perfect approach for you. Let me be clear: If you are a beginner, learning the craft, then this is a good place to start, one of the two best books on novel writing in my opinion. But this book will work for you only if you are best served by learning a basic formula first, then building upon it and venturing into the unknown or breaking the rules. Here's another way to look at it -- Some people can learn to drive a stick shift and traffic rules at the same time; others do better with an automatic transmission, allowing them to concentrate on learning traffic rules in a vehicle that shifts by itself (a formula), then later learning to use a manual transmission. If you are in this latter category, someone who learns better by first mastering the well-beaten path, then this is the best book to get you started 
This is one of the best books I've read on writing and I've read lots. I was amazed. Every chapter was important and significant. 
How to Write a Damn Good Novel is a very good book on the subject. It is all inclusive, well written, and to the point. The outline permits the reader to understand how to proceed and, because of a few very fine examples, to feel that it is possible. Something I learned from this book that is not necessarily in others is the idea of developing a compelling premise before engaging in the long process of writing a novel. The book is brief and could rank above the many books trying to help the writer with too many words 
This book is full of the best advice I have ever read for new writers - which is what I am, or hope to be 
Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as "Cheaters never win") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer 
I'm a junior in college, and my parents bought this cookbook for me as a gift for my first apartment. My experience with cooking hasn't really gone past heating up chicken cutlets in the oven, so I was a little wary of using an actual cookbook. But this book is really useful. The recipes are varied (snacks, "date-worthy" meals, desserts, healthier cooking, etc.), and there are also a lot of tips that can help out new cooks, be applied to other recipes, or adjust the ones already in the book for less ingredients or quicker preparation. A couple examples... -Blueberry Muffins: "Don't have buttermilk? Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice to 1 cup regular milk and let it sit for a minute before adding the egg." -Creamy Chicken with Noodles: "To serve the basic sauce in this recipe with other foods, leave out the frozen spinach and experiment with a different combination of seasonings, such as cayenne pepper or a hot sauce for seafood." -Grilled Honey Garlic Spareribs: "Don't have a grill? The ribs can also be baked....[gives instructions]. Baste the spareribs frequently with the honey garlic marinade during the final 30 minutes of cooking." In addition, the book provides helpful advice on food safety, how to store leftovers, and cooking terms ('simmer' I know, but 'blanch' and 'dredge' were helpful to have explained). Some people with more experience in the kitchen might find a lot of this book a little too basic, but I appreciate having instructions on how to hard-boil an egg, or to remember to leave a quarter-inch of potato pulp inside the skin when making stuffed potatoes so that the whole thing doesn't fall apart. I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is by no means for anyone living in a dorm (though it claims to be). Maybe some colleges have fully-stocked dorm kitchens and grocery stores right near campus, but this book is definitely better for a student living in an apartment with a kitchen, storage space, and time to make actual meals. There are definitely certain things about this book that some would consider drawbacks, but for a real first-timer with a kitchen, like myself, this book is perfect 
With the hotplate and microwave on the cover, you might think that this is a book of recipes that are prepared using those two items. This is not the case. Yes, there is a hotplate chapter and a microwave chapter, but a large number of recipes in the other 11 chapters require an oven. And even the microwave and hotplate recipes tend to require counter space, extensive preparation, and a large number and variety of ingredients. If you really do live in a dorm where you will have very little room, and only a mini-fridge and microwave, I suggest either finding another book, or just making it up as you go. Or if, like me, you live in a tiny studio with no counter space and only a fridge, microwave, and hotplate, it offers a few more options, but not much. Most of the recipes require too much preparation. And, if you are concerned about energy use and safety, many of the recipes also have fairly long cooking times. Overall, I'd say this would be a good book aimed at the beginning cook. Perhaps for someone who just moved into their first real apartment with a full kitchen. This is not a good book for anyone with limited space and resources 
Ben-Ari has written a highly enjoyable book about the nature of science that reads quickly and easily. I strongly recommend this book for anyone involved with teaching science (that may be a professor, secondary, or elementary school teacher). The author takes the best, most sober points from philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science and demonstrates the implications these works have for preparing a scientifically literate public. He clarifies troublesome definitions such as "theory" "fact" "proof" and "hypothesis". His insights on falsification and the need for an understanding of statistics are dead-on. I am using this book in the post-secondary courses I teach. Why only four stars? First, in his scientists' vignettes (where he uses biographical information on a scientist to illustrate a nature-of-science-point) are a rather homogenous bunch, for true excellence I would have to see more diverse group of scientists discussed. Secondly, his understanding of science as a discourse is somewhat impoverished, and I would say that his treatment of the topic isn't completely fair. But- this should not take away from a strong recommendation. Great book 
In this discerning and somewhat humorous essay, Virginia Woolf remarks on humanity's experiences with illness, whether mental or physical, and on how it is rarely the subject of literature or art. She notes our contradictory nature toward sympathy and offers an opinion about what illness tells us about the natural world. Hermione Lee's fascinating introduction firmly places this remarkable work in the context of Woolf's life and writing. This Paris Press edition recreates the original artwork and typeset of the 1930 printing of "On Being Ill" 
Get ordained in something!?!?!?!?! Interview the town hermit for the local newspaper!?!?!?!?! Need I say more 
I'm married and bought this book for some ideas on what to do while my husband is out of town on business trips or playing weekend warrior. I disagree with the last review; I think the whole idea for the book (we'll give you the ideas, you plan it out) is right on. After all, isn't it supposed to be about getting out of the house and into life? Nor do I agree with the sentiment that going to town hall meetings are "not fun at all." Maybe getting involved with city politics isn't your idea of a good time, but what's one woman's junk is another woman's treasure. Overall, a very good read with even better ideas 
I love this book and have bought some for gifts for friends and family too! The authors have created and collected lots of highly innovative ideas and presented them in such a humorous way. I have literally laughed "out loud" upon reading most of the chapters. When is their next book coming out? I can't wait 
Truly a classic and juggernaut effort of bringing together various disparate scientific socio-anthropological thoughts into a coherent and fluent theory - and more amazingly in a form that is both accessible and entertaining for the layman reader. 
This book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13,000 years across the continents. Diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume. The impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from New Guinea named Yali. Yali's question was, "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?" Reading the book, I think I gulped at this point. This sounds like a classic, loaded question. It sounds disturbingly close to why have we (Europe and its former colonies) succeeded where they have failed. Diamond does not descend into that territory though, but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely. There are references to a culture's success in industrializing or condensing populations that Diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing, for instance. The advantages of a hunting/gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast Asia. This history can probably be described (or perhaps is most successful) as based around environmental causation (as opposed to the racial/ethnic/social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing). Descriptions of climate (note: that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age), longitudinal or latitudinal axes, elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity. Still, it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title. Guns. Europe's refinement of this technology was based on China's innovations with gunpowder. Today's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated. As an interesting counterpoint, Japan had owned more and better guns in c. 1600 CE, than any country in the world. Samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology. Japan wouldn't resume manufacture until mid 19th century. Obviously, there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today. Germs. Epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn't survive. Smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities. Epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals (and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate). Interesting note: the emperors of the Mayan and Incan civilizations both succumb to disease (likely smallpox) rather than guns. Steel. Technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities. A hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining, as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas. Diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society, where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses. There are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things. First, there appears to need to be sustainable farming. Many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region (where today we invade, suck oil, and force the conquered to endure freedom). The western Asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop. As a complete side note, the Genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how Joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in Egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming. Another factor in the civilizing of Eurasia is the landmass itself. Compared to Africa and the Americas, Eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south. Movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal. Something like corn (maize) which was domesticated in central Americas took a very long time to make it to North America because of geography. Llamas and guinea pigs (which could be useful for pack animals and food) never made it north. Conversely, all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle, horses, pigs were able to spread from one tip of Asia to the opposite tip of Europe. To answer Yali's question, some of the answer is luck. Africa, Australia and the Americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that Eurasia had. Some other is environmental determinism, where you are helps make up who you become. For going forward, Diamond cites transportation, communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future. After word: Harpers Magazine tackles an issue that was brought up, but not as fully developed here, that of pre-Clovis Native American discoveries (pronouncements), knowingly confronting a loaded racial/ethnocentric question in a folio called "Might White of You: Are American Archaeologists White Supremacists?" The archaeological records supports people living in the Americas since about 9000-11000 BCE. There are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date, but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive. One wonders if the pre-Clovis discovery (especially all the business about "caucusoid" skulls), isn't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide. 
One the best books on the subject. A must read, but you need to know your history and geography first, if not, have a map ready. Be prepared for a fast and furious ride through time and geography, but with constant flashbacks to the present. You will not look at the world the same way after finishing this book, provided that you have the intellectual capacity and curiousity to read it cover to cover. 
I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
This is an extremely interesting book with wonderful insights of the Human development, A must in everyone's shelves!!! 
This book is a must read for all social science academics and the like. J. Diamond presents a clear argument for why certain societies are more advantaged than others. Although he is believable, his argument is flawed which makes for a great paper topic 
Diamond presents a look at the evolution of various Cultures throughout the World and how geography has played an important part in their developement. The reason that Eurasia and North Africa evolved more highly developed (technologically anyway) cultures was that there was a wider variety of wild plant and animal species that could be tamed by the humans living in those areas following the Ice Age than there was available to humans in other parts of the world. This enabled people in these areas to develope farming societies (which required more specializations than hunter gatherer societies) more quickly than in other parts of the globe. The close proximity of animals in this farming societies passed on germs from animal hosts to humans and evolved human resistance to pathogens such as smallpox to survivors of the diseases and their offspring. Those areas such as the Americas without large domesticated animals to catch diseases from were decimated by Old World diseases when they were introduced by European Explorers. The premise of the book could have degenerated into White Supremacist or Multi-Cultural nonsense and the fact that it doesn't says a lot about the writing skills of the author. One fact that he doesn't address is how the freedom of expression is a key factor in the development of societies. When that Freedom disappears or is suppressed as in the case of 15 C China or 18 C Holland society tends to stagnant and decline. I would reccomend the book for those interested in History, Anthropology, or Sociology 
This is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length. I want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful, engaging and thought provoking story. This book packs the punch of great fiction. It covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic. You certainly don't need to be a history major, biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author. Jared Diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography, environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations. I think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesn't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history. If you don't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture, the need for armies, etc. You will find this fascinating reading. If you have a deep knowledge of these areas, anthropology and sociology, you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying. However, most likely you will enjoy the well-written story if you can keep in mind that it doesn't provide the full picture. In short, this book magnificently illuminates Jared Diamond's specific areas of interest, while downplaying or neglecting others. It provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner. 
I recommend this book to anyone who has come from a dispensational background and is interested in eschatology (end-times). It is very well written with short chapters that don't bog the reader down with difficult theological jargon. Exposes the reader to a historicist (typically Seventh Day Adventist) interpretation of end-times scriptures that will challenge you to dig deeper into the Word of God with a critical eye 
THIS IS A MUST READ NO MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE! I've read quite a few and then some on the END TIMES and this is the best book on the end times and inter-related topics. It is a super-fast read, simple and concise, filled with scripture to back up evey editorial paragraph. No matter what you know, don't know or just always believed... THIS IS A MUST READ! It is topical in writing style which makes it easy to use as a template for comparing with other books (except OTHER BOOKS ON SAME SUBJECT tend to be muddled and long-winded!). We are now using as a foundation for further in-depth study in a Bible study group and have bought 10 books so everyone has their own copy! THIS IS A 5-STAR BOOK NO MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE - very compelling and easy to read!!! A+A+A+A+A++ 
A Case for Amillennialism: Understanding the End Times by Kim Riddlebarger is the best book going on End Times. Escape the craziness for good, and buy this book. Hopefully, you'll get that "Finally it all makes sense" understanding of what the scriptures tell of the End Times 
This is the second book by Steve Wohlberg that I have read.This book is more comprehensive than "Truth Left Behind."Mr. Wohlberg's books are easy reads.I'll state up-front that I don't agree with everything that he wrote.The identity of Israel in this book is basically replacement theology,or the idea of a "spiritual Israel".When considering that Revelation identifies 12 tribes in Rev.7:4-8(see also 21:12-13)I can't see Israel being a spiritual entity.Enough of the negative...The historicist view is very sensible when considering the source of the preterist and futuristic views of Revelation.I didn't know the history or source of these two theories before reading Steve Wohlberg's books.He exposes the flaws in both theories well.Why would the Church be spared tribulation when countless believers of the past were murdered for their beliefs?Check out "Foxe's Book of Martyrs".Steve Wohlberg does an excellent job in answering that question and more with the Bible.Take the Bible and a knowledge of history and you can learn a lot about the book of Revelation!While I do disagree on one point,I recommend this book as an answer to the fiction of the "Left Behind" series 
What a great book. I have been studying the Bible on these subjects for sometime and was convinced that the the Holy Scriptures did not teach the commonly held evangelical view of the rapture, Israel, and the antichrist. Praise God that a voice has been raised to expose these fables and deceptions. If you are a sincere Bible student I would encourage you to get this book. Could it have been put together better? Probably, but let not that take away from the truths that are revealed here. Christians it is high time that we get back to the Burean method of Bible study (Acts 17) and not be taken by certain authors just because the local Christian Bookstore promotes them. If we are deceived, we have no one to blame but ourselves because truth is out there. The question is: Are we willing to dig for it? 
Interesting eye opener. I would have preferred a longer presentation of evidence to sustain it's conclusions 
This is a good introduction for those who are interested in a comprehensive, but not in-depth, review of the historicist view. Wohlberg covers a lot of ground in 200 pages, so he does not look at alternative interpretations of passages or examine potential textual difficulties. He simply presents the interpretation as he sees it. This is appropriate to the book's intended audience, however, which appears to be a popular audience, not a scholarly one. The book is, unfortunately, light on what I consider to be the most difficult interpretations - namely, the trumpets and bowls of Revelation - but so are most historicist books I've reviewed recently. In terms of style, this book is well written. Wohlberg is, however, fond of complementing his arguments with elaborate and sensational phrases such as "earthshattering" and "bombshell," which can be repeated several times in a single chapter. Several times, he compares his arguments to the iceberg that sunk the Titanic (futurism). This kind of self-congratulation gets old very quickly, and it is irritating and distracting in an otherwise professional presentation. The most disturbing aspect of Wolberg's presentation, however, is that he presents historicism, not only as the preferred view, but the only interpretation leading to life. He regularly ties futurism and preterism to the spirit of antichrist and leading, using his own words, "potentially, to hell." This belief is based on the standard historicist interpretation that the papal system is the Antichrist of prophecy, and that the school of futurism was invented by - and, thus, is wholly a deception of - this system. Therefore, Wohlberg suggests that anyone holding the preterist or futurist view is subject to the coming wrath and judgment upon this papal system, even to the point of leading individuals to eternal judgment. The idea that one's end-times views - in and of themselves - could lead to eternal destruction is a disturbing and theologically unsound viewpoint that is woven throughout an otherwise good book. In all, my criticism are minor. This is a well-done book and, considering its intended purpose and audience, a good introduction to historicism for anyone researching this view. - H. L. Nigro, author of "Before God's Wrath: The Bible's Answer to the Timing of the Rapture 
i havent read the book, but i have something to say in response to Gregory Nyman. he said, "Scripture makes it very clear that Christ lived, died on the Cross, shed his blood for the remission of sins, and rose from the dead to justify those who believe in Him, and as a result, receive eternal life. Jesus also said that those who loved Him would follow His commandments, and He cited the two greatest commandments as loving God with all our heart, soul, strength, and mind, and loving our neighbor as ourselves. Nowhere does the Bible teach that it's 'Christ plus the Commandments.' To come to Christ is to follow - Christ plus nothing and Christ minus nothing. He is our all in all. He is the fulfillment of the Law to all those who believe." I understand his stance on the 10 commandments because i have many friends that think like him. the problem is, people like him dont even believe in the 10 commandments anymore (if you don't, thats fine...but then why believe the bible at all). but for these people, its still a sin to lie, commit adultry, steal, murder, ect., but its not a sin to break the sabbath. following Gods laws based one what you "feel" is idiotic. if you follow one, you should follow them all. you can not pick an choose. following God's law isnt legalism. making up your own laws to say how good you are is (i dont think he said that, but thats often an argument people use). the sabbath is in the bible, it was created by God on the first week of creation, and nothing in the bible refutes that. (i have seen the lame attempts by people to try to use the bible to refute the sabbath, and it is....lame) lastly, like he mentioned that God talked about the 2 greatest commandments. he is right, but if you break down the 10 commandments, they all fall into one of those 2 commandments. he isnt somehow changing this laws or standards for us when He mentions this. all he is doing is stating the principles behind the commandments. love God, and love man. God forgives and GOd is great, but he does have standards, and its dangerous to ignore them. im not a perfect person, but the logic presented by that reader is fallacious 
When I first started reading this book, I literally devoured it from page to page, believing it to be groundbreaking and a tour-de-force. After I read it, I reflected on its message, and found I wasn't as excited as I first thought. Then I thought about writing a review, but had to caution against emotionalism, and this kind of book certainly stirs up the pot of emotionalism. Steve Wohlberg does hit on some "sacred cows," theologically, though, and I found I had some common ground with him on the Rapture, and the Anti-Christ, as he cited solid historical sources to support his thesis. However, as I continued to read on, I discovered to my dismay that I'd read some of this stuff before - in the 7th Day Adventist literature. As a matter of fact, Steve Wohlberg, although admittedly a Messianic Jew, has written for Pacific Press and other Seventh Day Adventist press publications. Then there's the issue of the way of salvation. He claims that the "faithful" will be saved by trusting in Christ for their salvation...AND...keeping the 10 Commandments. This is solid Adventist teaching, and there's no two ways around it. Other teachings have focused on keeping the Sabbath as another "legal" requirement of salvation, although after a couple of questions to him about this, he stated that he didn't hold to that view. Scripture makes it very clear that Christ lived, died on the Cross, shed his blood for the remission of sins, and rose from the dead to justify those who believe in Him, and as a result, receive eternal life. Jesus also said that those who loved Him would follow His commandments, and He cited the two greatest commandments as loving God with all our heart, soul, strength, and mind, and loving our neighbor as ourselves. Nowhere does the Bible teach that it's "Christ plus the Commandments." To come to Christ is to follow - Christ plus nothing and Christ minus nothing. He is our all in all. He is the fulfillment of the Law to all those who believe. Although ready to rate this book very high...after a great deal of thought, it can only be the lowest. Sorry, Steve. You didn't convince me. You're either a biblical Christian or a follower of E.G. White 
"Anthropologist on Mars" begins with a quote by geneticist J.B.S. Haldane - a quote that so beautifullly sums up the book's aim as to bear repeating: "The universe is not only queerer than we imagine, but queerer than we can imagine." Oliver Sacks's seven paradoxical tales aim at showing us just that. We are offered a mere glimpse of the neurological pluriverse and, in so witnessing, become able to appreciate just how 'queer' human nature can be. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about the outline of each story, so I will leave that to them. What I wish to point out to prospective readers is Sack's ability, through his tales, to make the ordinary things about our brains that we take for granted, appear unique, fragile, and more special than we might have thought. For instance, we witness two stories dealing with sight. First, we explore the case of a painter who loses ALL sense of color late in life. We also see its opposite - a blind man given sight late in life. In the first case, we get a real sense of how integral the sense of color is for life. We watch this man describe how the world becomes infinitely duller and less interesting when all one can see is shades of gray. He is driven almost to suicide! In the next tale, we see how astonishingly hard it is to 'learn to see' and all the things the brain must do to achieve this (which becomes all the harder the older one is). We also meet some folks who are autistic and, as such, lack the social instincts and abstraction that we who have them take for granted. Imagine, if you can, having to learn social rules (such things as body language, vocal inflection, and sense of humor) like one would learn algebra - not instinctually, but intellectually. And imagine being mystified by ideas like romantic love and the beauty of music. Temple Grandin - in the final of Sacks tales - shows us what this is like. Through all of this, Sacks takes on the role not only of a neurologist and story teller, but of a philosopher. The philosopher takes the ordinary and puts it under a microscope to show us how breath-taking it really is. Just because most of us - the impaired call us neurotypicals - have brains that smoothly operate thus and so, does not mean that we all do. Some, like Virgil, have to work hard at seeing such basic things as 2D represntations of 3D objects. Others, like Temple Grandin, have to work at understanding the idea of sociality. All in all, this is a stunning book that will make you think and marvel. Dare I say, if you are like me, you will never look at the human brain with quite the same lens as you did before. 
I recommend Dennis Littrell's review of this book on this site.He outlines clearly what the book is about, and gives us the basic story of each of the seven chapters, the seven cases that make up the book. He headlines his review 'extraordinary genius' and I share this feeling about Oliver Sachs. What I find most remarkable about Sachs' work is his ability to patiently study, and work to help people who seem lost completely. Instead of being as most of us are repelled by these kind of often 'freakish abnormalities ' Sachs in studying the people and recounting their cases , makes their stories 'human'. He extends in a certain way our conception of what the human is, and increases our sense of how remarkable the human mind is. He is also a most moving author whose human sympathy and compassion inspire. 
An Anthropologist on Mars is the much anticipated follow-up to his previous best-seller, The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat. In it, Dr. Sacks further explores the recesses of the Central Nervous System's never ending quest for logic and understanding. Gestalt tells us that if we look at a broken circle long enough, the brain will fill-in the missing piece. The brain easily embraces a circle, but finds no concrete logic to a broken circle. Thus, the brain rejects such a concept as impossible. Consider our memories: most people have heard that eye witness accounts of rare events are digitized in such a way that the brain can change the sequence of events in a manner scewed toward the logical arrangment of the rare event. People who have witnessed an aircraft explode during flight most often remember this rare event quite differently immeadiatley after it happens. Plains don't explode then crash, plains crash, then they explode. That makes sense to the brain, but explode then crash does not make sense. OK, enough of Psych 101. As a neurologist, Dr. Sacks understands how the brain works, and is thus able to explain it in an easy going manner. It wasn't until a skiing accident though inwhich Dr. Sacks lost a leg, and learned first hand the phenomonon of phanthom feeling that he became fully aware of the brains search for logic. The brain hates the idea of ONE LEG, and thus continues to accept information from something that isn't even there, and, more remarkably, responds to the information. Now armed with subjectivity as well as objectivity, Dr. Sacks marshalls his considerable talent as a writer and walks a thin line in the telling of our miraculous brain. Finally, it's clear he really cares about the people he puts forth as examples of neurological insult. He offers us a wide variety of people, thier afflictions, and the results. He does seem to favor Tourette Syndrome as a perfect example of a brain run amuk. After all, Tourette Syndrome is named after a student of great French neurologist Jean Charcot. Dr. Tourette devoted his career to the study of one person who suffered from what we now call Tourette Syndrome. Dr. Sacks widens the view effectively. 
This is one of those non-fiction books which keeps you turning the pages. Sacks is a neurologist who aside from having insights into the field also obviously truley cares about his subjects. He uses this care to get to a depth of explanation of case histories in a manner I have not encountered before. Highly recommended 
These are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist. Oliver Sacks, author of the justly celebrated, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986) and Awakenings (1973), which was later made into a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity. He has a style that is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical comparisons and wisdom. Part of the power of these tales, and of all of Sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality. This makes for a compelling read. If you've never read Sacks before, you are in for a very special treat. These tales are paradoxical because "Defects, disorders, diseases" can bring out "latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might never be seen or even be imaginable, in their absence." It is this "'creative' potential, that forms the central theme of this book" (from Sacks's Preface, page xvi). The first tale, "The Case of the Colorblind Painter" is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five, and the effect this had on his life and work. The second, "The Last Hippie" is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties. Sacks tells this sad, pathetic story with vivid detail, and characteristically ends it with a footnote, a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears. (Don't skip the footnotes!) The third tale, "A Surgeon's Life," is an amazing account of a Canadian surgeon with Tourette's syndrome. It is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination. Dr. Carl Bennett, riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder, compulsions that cause him to throw things, to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner, to flail, jump and jerk about, nonetheless became a very successful (and beloved) doctor of surgery. Sacks scrubs up with Dr. Bennett and goes into surgery with him, during which, miraculously, the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery. Sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children, sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls, and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be. The fourth tale, "To See and Not See," is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing. This sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain. This tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination.  In the fifth tale, "The Landscape of His Dreams, we meet a gifted artist, Franco Magnani, who from memory alone recreates his home town of Pontito, Italy through his paintings. He has a nearly photographic, three-dimensional memory, but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one, he cares only to re-create his Pontito, not the people or events, but the houses, the masonry, the stones, and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail. The chapter "Prodigies," focuses on an autistic artist, Stephen Wiltshire, whom Sacks is determined to befriend and understand. In this tale, and the concluding tale, "An Anthropologist on Mars," Sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it (at least in my interpretation) as an alternate view of reality, a view with its own strengths and weaknesses, a world that is just as true and valid as the "normal" one. Of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme, and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society. Yet, perhaps that is society's loss. I even got the sense, in reading these concluding stories about autism, that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary "strategy" trying to emerge, that is, a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work. I would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic, with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration, are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness, and that humankind is the better for it. Incidentally, the last tale about Temple Grandin, who is a professor of animal studies at Colorado State University, is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society, yet remains autistic. She is the one who says she sometimes feels, because of her different perspective, like "an anthropologist on Mars" when she views "normal" people. Sacks allows us to see why. Bottom line: this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition, written with grace and a deep sense of humanity, not to be missed 
This is the first Oliver Sacks book I've read and I found it fascinating and informative. Once I started a case history I was hard-put to stop reading until I found out the end result. I particularly enjoyed the stories about the amnesiac Greg and the colorblind artist. Sacks puts a human face on insights about how our brains work in an intellectually stimulating yet emotionally touching way. I found the story about Virgil, the blind man who gets his sight back and must learn how to see in his 50s particularly heart-wrenching. The only story I bailed out on was about an autistic woman who works in a cattle slaughterhouse. (I could not handle the graphic nature of the story.) I definitely recommend this book if you appreciate shows like Nova or if you watch Discovery television. Anyone who wants to know more about the mysteries of our human brains will be enriched by this book 
I know very little about psychology, but I found this book to be both informative and touching. I first heard about it when a cook at my summer camp read us "The Last Hippie" during an evening program. I was fascinated by the story. Finally, when I picked up a copy of the book for myself, I read through the whole thing in a day. I actually cried during one of the stories. Oliver Sacks teaches you a lot about how the human brain works without getting too clinical, and lets the humanity of the people he profiles shine through. This is a really good book 
Oliver Sacks' An Anthropologist on Mars is a delightful and enlightening book that reveals the unparalleled complexity of the human brain. Sacks, an accomplished neurologist and author, presents seven case studies that highlight different neurological phenomena. In his case studies, Sacks follows a newly colorblind painter, a man who can create no new memories, a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome, a blind man who regains his sight, a painter obsessed with images from his childhood, an autistic boy artist, and a high-functioning autistic professor. Sacks does not treat his case studies as dry medical oddities but rather discusses their neurological experiences within their broader human existence. Unlike other authors who know their patients only distantly, Sacks works intimately with his case studies and develops meaningful relationships that translate into a deeper, more insightful understanding of his patients and their experiences. While Sacks is clearly a brilliant neurologist, what makes this book so powerful is his ability to weave in medicine, science, history, and philosophy into a coherent narrative. Every case study illuminates a series of important and thought-provoking questions that challenge the everyday assumptions of perception, reality, intelligence, and what it means to be human. In the end, the reader emerges with a better appreciation of the complexity of the human mind. The book is very well documented with copious footnotes provided throughout the book. Occasionally, Sacks neglects to define some arcane medical terms, so readers would do well to keep a dictionary close at hand. Overall, the book is highly accessible to the general reader who will find it intriguing and intellectually rewarding. 
Expertly written, the stories are fascinating, endearing, enlightening. You'll learn so much about how your own mind is wired by reading the stories of these very special people. The medical and literary communities need more people like Oliver Sacks 
If you're interested in campaigns and politics, this is a great book to pick up! Although it may seem thick, the pages somehow manage to fly by. James Baker is the epitome of a political guru! If you didn't know that before reading the book, you certainly will know it afterward 
You read a book like this to get a feel for what's it would be like to be considered the GOLD STANDARD in electoral politics. Nobody in modern times has had the success or the good fortune to be on the winning side of so many Presidential elections. One of Baker's competitors is James Carville, the man who more than any other, helped Bill Clinton to defeat George HW Bush and his manager James A. Baker III in 1992. It was Carville who referred to Baker as the Gold Standard. To understand James Baker, you have to understand where he is coming from. He was originally a Houston based "Society Lawyer" from a prominent family which allowed him to attend Princeton University. A "Society Lawyer" simply caters to the needs of very rich people. Whatever it is they need, the lawyer fixes it, quite a nice life if you can do it. Baker also has a wonderful, gregarious personality. In person, he is charming to a fault, and a total class act. You have to like the guy. The question one needs to ask is how did Baker parlay a general legal practice in Houston, and morph it into becoming probably the second most important person in government under two successive Presidents. Even more interesting is how did Baker survive his entire tenure in Washington without being either destroyed, or contaminated by the system. He was able to walk away from his experiences, which were quite extensive, without anybody laying a glove on him. I was involved in a conversation with former President Nixon on this topic many years ago. The President felt that there were only 250,000 people in the United States that counted. These people own the media, the corporations, they control the institutions, and they have the wealth. The President felt that if you stripped this entire group of their wealth, power, and positions, in ten years, the wealth and power would be right back where it started from. I submit to you that James Baker made himself the indispensable man to whoever he came into contact with. If you strip Baker of his power and position, within a few years he would be right back in the thick of it. Was there some luck involved? You bet there was, and this book is full of stories where so much luck was involved. He specifically mentions in the book that being a Marine during the Korean War, he was transferred to the Mediterranean, not Korea, where most of his associates perished in the war. Was it the luck of the draw that led to his Mediterranean assignment, or string pulling? We will never know, and he's not telling. Here's a man that was George Bush's man, (the current President's father), during the 1980 campaign when Bush went head to head against Ronald Reagan for the Republican Presidential nomination. This was the second time Baker moved against Reagan. He was also part of Ford's team when Reagan challenged the seating President for the nomination in 1976. What happens as a result? Reagan wins the nomination in 1980, and Baker joins the Reagan team. Having done a great job during the election process, he somehow manages against all odds to maneuver himself into the position of Chief of Staff to Ronald Reagan. Previous to this, Reagan had always surrounded himself with people with very long track records with him. How did Baker manage to leap over every one of the loyalists? The answer is that this is a very SPECIAL MAN. I have known a lot of people in Washington up close and personal. If you are perceptive, and interested, it really doesn't take long to figure out who's real, who's a phony, who gets things done, and who doesn't. There are very few people in James Baker's league. There are only two other people I can compare him to. The first was Abe Fortas, a former Supreme Court Justice who was one of the most brilliant men to ever serve in government. I value a picture I have of him sitting in Lyndon Johnson's White House, not at the table, but in a seat by the window. It was obvious Fortas was pulling the strings in the room. The second man, I would compare Baker to would be Clark Clifford. He was another magnificent power broker who served every Democratic President from Harry Truman forward for 30 years. What's interesting is that both of these men Fortas, and Clifford had problems late in their careers that tarnished their reputations. Baker remains untouched by scandal. Nobody in the last 40 years has enjoyed better relations with the press than James Baker. I do not ever recall at any point while he served in government reading anything negative that was written about him. The only person that came close is Colin Powell, and Baker is at the game longer. The reason is that nobody cultivated the press like James Baker. Did Baker leak to the press? He says no, but he does admit to providing background to reporters without allowing attribution back to himself. It was more than background. Baker probably provided anything, and everything the press required in order to keep his reputation intact. There is no other explanation for the continuous favorable press this man received during his entire stay in Washington DC, a truly cutthroat town. He also doesn't have a bad word to say about anybody else. He simply doesn't burn bridges. This attitude goes all the way back to his days as a society lawyer. If you never say anything negative about people, you have an opportunity to have them all as clients. Everybody loves James Baker. I particularly enjoy reading a book like this because you pick up certain ideas, and possibilities about politics that you will just never learn any other way, because there's just so much noise out there that it's overwhelming. Let me give you a couple of notions: � "When wounded, stop the bleeding immediately" - Here Baker is telling us that when it goes bad for you in politics, you have to deal with the issue immediately and kill the issue. Don't wait, or you're dead. An example would be Senator Kerry's failure to respond to the misleading Swift Boat accusations made against him in the 04 Presidential election cycle. � "First time out, win or lose, you learn a lot" - He's telling you that there is no substitute for experience. You may not win the race the first time, as Baker lost with Ford in 1976, but it prepared him for 1980, where he became the gold standard in politics. � "Proximity is POWER" - Yes, absolutely. You want an office close to the President. The closer the office, the more power you absolutely have, and are perceived to have. � "Tax hikes without spending restraints never balance the budget, Congress always spends the new money and more" - How brilliant is this statement. It explains perfectly the last six years under a Republican dominated Presidency, and Congress. Whoever is in power spends money. It doesn't matter who it is, or what party he's from. � "Image Trumps Substance" - Wow, did he get this one right. It's all about PERCEPTION, or better yet, take credit for all miracles occurring within 50 miles. � "Better to assume the worst, and try to do something about it, than to assume the best, and get blindsided" - This is a lesson we could all take with us. � "Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance - He learned this from his father, and mentions it many times throughout the book. Practicing what he called the five P's held him in good steed throughout his career, and he continues to practice this behavior today. If you have an interest in politics and history, you would do well to take the time to peruse this book. It's an easy read, Baker is not looking to sell you, or persuade you in this book. Read it, and you will learn what life at the top of Washington was like during a very interesting period in our nation's history. Good luck. Richard Stoyeck 
I did not know a great deal about James Baker before I read this book, but I mean it as a compliment to the clarity of his reminiscences when I say I think I do now. In the field of political autobiography, it is not always the case that one emerges knowing more about the author and subject than when one began. From the pages of his book I discern that James Baker is not without wit, albeit at times a distinctly biting one. He is also less a statesman than a politician, and less a politician than a man with protective loyalty to his friends. He is perhaps above all someone with a talent for inserting himself into a situation and calling on a lifetime's worth of well-placed contacts when there is a need to get things done. In short, to his party and to its inner circle, Mr. Baker is invaluable. James Addison Baker began his adult life as an apolitical Texas Democrat, and emerges today four decades after he took up campaigning as a form of therapy (after his wife's passing) as an elder tactician of the Republican Party. His is the sort of book that will deservedly please Republicans, understandably miff Democrats, raise a few eyebrows and hackles here and there among independents, and ultimately I fear its anecdotes about such varying matters as families ties surpassing race, the "real" way politics in America works, his compliments on the brilliance of Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush, as well as others with whom he has served---in short the best part of the book---will unfortunately be lost on many who purchase it for strictly political reasons. Let me point out now that this book is NOT about Baker's political neutrality, nor was it expected to be, but one of its strengths is that I think James Baker wrote candidly. That's also one of its weaknesses, for while I admired the similar candidness that went into Jesse Helms' memoir last year, this book does make Baker come across a few times as something of a power-hungry, vindictive man. I think in large part Baker used this often interesting re-telling of his role in modern political affairs as a platform to get even a time or two with those against whom he feels grudges, particularly former Vice President Al Gore, whose attacks on both Baker and Baker's boss, former President Bush, during the 1992 White House race became as Baker seems to have seen it, a little too personal. What is interesting about Baker's book is of course its recounting of his service in several Republican administrations, and also his role as a major behind the scenes player in the election campaigns that placed many of those politicians there. Baker most recently was a strategist who oversaw the current President Bush's 2000 White House run, and while there does seem some merit in his reminder that the final Supreme Court decision that settled the disputed 2000 election was rendered 7-2, in my opinion I couldn't help but see Baker leaving behind some of his candidness and resorting to becoming a hard-line strategist even after that particular battle is long over. This is a relatively short and surprisingly fast-flowing sort of trek back through the life of an extremely well-connected man, and while I disagree with Baker on many issues, I did think much of what he had to say was interesting and that it serves as a unique view into a realm of politics typically closed-off to most of us 
In reflecting upon the life of James Baker through his second memoir 'Work Hard, Study . . . and Keep Out of Politics!' the one thing that continued to stay in my mind is Baker's openess that one of the reasons why he stayed in politics was 'power'. What a refreshing statement: the Truth! This is not so minimal a statement when reading the many self-serving political memoirs published, particularly from the Reagan-era politicians who have published throughtout the years. The life of Jame Baker is quite remarkable, and the sharing of his life and decisions as shared in this memoir are encompassing of service to this nation well done. I may not necessarily agree with all the decisions made by Baker during the years he served 3 different presidents, but I do respect the man and the integrity of this book. There rings certain truths throughout, and his openess about 'power' provide a sense of credability to his perspectives 
I can't recommend this book highly enough. I read the original book, and loved it, but knew there was more that i was missing. The workbook asks detailed and sometimes confronting questions, and acts as an aide to hearing God. I found once i started asking God these questions, i had the insight i needed to break through so many of the walls i'd put to God, myself, and others. As a result, my relationships are healthier, and i am a less defensive person. 
I found myself reaching to answer these questions, in the spirit of being cooperative....almost making mountains out of molehills as I viewed my life 
I never take the time to write reviews so take this as a "sixth star" for The sacred Romance along with it's study guide companion. I first read the book a year ago and had a "so-so" reaction to it. It was good, and it helped me take a unique look at God's most dramatic act of love on our behalf. Still, I pretty much forgot about it not long after I read it. I can't tell you how different my reaction to this book was about a year later when my small group decided to use T.S.R. for our lesson. Wow! We now have a level of trust with each other and with that trust have been able to share old wounds of the heart that were prohibiting us from the most important relationship of our lives (a relationship with God of course) and we were also able to build each other up. If you are in a small group I URGE you to consider The Sacred Romance. If everyone in your group is honest and takes the chance to be a little vulnerable with each other it will change the dynamics of how you study together dramatically 
Read this if you desire to take you faith to the edge with on the living God as your guid 
Since I am a World's Fair "fanatic" I have read almost everything that I can on the subject. In general, this is an interesting and well researched book. The author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about. However, I must point up three rather glaring errors in the book. In describing the Louisiana World Expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be "80 feet tall,just 150 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower." Since the Eiffel Tower is actually over 900 feet tall,the New Orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall.This may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time.The other error states that the US Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair of 1958 was a "large,squat,round concrete block structure." It was indeed large and round, but not squat and not made of concrete blocks.According to the excellent book about Edward Durrell Stone, the architect of the pavilion,the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light. I have seen photos of the US Pavilion, and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me. (In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion, which resembled a large refrigerator!) Thirdly, the Spokane Expo of 1974 was not the first time that the U.S.S.R. exhibited at a U.S. expo. They had a large pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939. All in all, however, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of World's Fairs 
The author is definately very qualified to write this book. He generally keeps the reader engrossed as he creates the backdrop and context for each of the fairs. Unfortunately, he doesnt go very in depth into any particular fair, and the reader is left craving more photos. The author frequently boasts about his extensive collection of memorabilia, but too little is shown. Its enjoyable for a quick read, but if you are interested in more in depth knowledge and imagery, you should investigate one of the more comprehensive books 
I loved this book. Ever since my high school English teacher chastised me for trying to put Miller's The Crucible in the context of the McCarthy era, I have been fascinated with the social context surrounding the creation of art. Jones focuses on the political as well as social context that has given birth to the great...and the mediocre...of the American musical. First, his use of terms such as "diversionary" ring so true for those of us who love mindless fluff when we go to the theatre. Second, I was shocked at how little I had appreciated the contributions of African-Americans, inter alia, to the American stage prior to reading this book. But, mostly, I liked how he articulated how a writer's gestalt accounts for the end product on the stage and his description of how copy-cat musicals come into being. The book gave me the backstory to many of the original shows I had the good fortune to see on Broadway. I, for one, would love a Volume II of this book to be Jones' next foray. I especially offer this to aspiring young actors, writers, directors and songwriters as a required read before embarking on a life in musical theater. If you want to create art, you must know from whence you came 
As a lover of Musical Theater, and (minor) toiler in the vineyards, myself, I have probably read hundreds of books on the subject. Therefore, it is always a special treat to find one that brings a fresh slant to the subject. Jones' book does just that. By treating musical theater styles neither as a simple reflection of, nor an escape from the world at large, but rather as an integral part of the whole, he presents a broad, but always entertaining and on-target view of both the 20th century and musical theater's part within same. There are, as there always are in works of this scope, some factual errors (e.g. "No Strings" wasn't Richard Rodgers' only "public" credit as a lyricist. He's also so credited on the score for the TV musical "Androcles &amp; The Lion". It ain't Broadway-in every sense-but it IS public!) but none that take anythng away from the over-all achievement of the work 
The begining of the book is a little tough, being a "White male" But this a book that everyone should read! The world would be a better place if they did 
This book and the others by Anne Wilson Schaef have helped me to put my own experience with family and society into a healthy perspective. I say, bravo to this lady and her work! Excellent! This work put me on the path to true emotional healing and understanding of why people act in harmful ways. I say, no less than brillant. Thanks Anne!! You Rock 
I read this book years ago...or, rather, tried to. I'm sure there are better examples of the truism, "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail," but not many.  If you're another 12-step 'bot who peppers your conversation and decals your bumper with slogans like "One Day at a Time," you'll probably really, really like _When Society Becomes an Addict_. I myself found it to be one of the worst self-help books I've ever seen ... and in a genre glutted with self-indulgence, pseudo-science, and hidden agendas, that's saying a lot.  If there is anything we emphatically do *not* need more of in politics, it's therapy. Lift your head out of your 12-step cocoon and look around you: We've got people using various and often spurious diagnoses to shirk responsibility for everything from proper child-rearing to murder. We've been bringing back censorship with a vengeance in the last few decades because of a misguided belief that the world must cater to the delicate psyches of the traumatized, the easily offended, the "oppressed," and, most of all, "da chyldrun." And no politician dares run for any major office without drawing lots of attention to his or her "sensitive side," often with short, sappy, pseudo-heartwarming "personal interest" films.  Schaef may indeed have claimed that men are no longer the problem, but obviously she still claims that we need to feminize American society more. Uh, when little boys are widely and heavily medicated just for acting like little boys, I think we've feminized society quite enough. And I'm a woman with a good many feminist sympathies.  Too bad it had to take September 11th to wake so many people up to the fact that we need more than consensus-seekers, empathizers, and nurturers -- we need leaders, individuals with the courage to make unpopular moral judgments, and warriors and heroes. Of both sexes 
This brilliantly innovative thinker throws back the curtains on our collective society's understanding of ourselves, and opens up possibilities for really positive solutions to what ails our society as a whole, and its individuals, in particular! Ms. Schaef addresses all forms of addiction, from chemical to behavioral, and sees within our society's gradual acceptance of its own corruptions the seven deadly sins of anger, covetousness, envy, gluttony, lust, pride and sloth. Perpetuating our malaise we see in our leaders the aspects of control, dishonesty and dualism (seeing only two alternative solutions to any problem.) It is shocking to face these at first, but once the truth of it dawns on the reader, he/she is led through the greatest assisting factors toward our collective "recovery": Process (the ideas used in the 12-step programs); Sobriety (fastest route to clear thinking); and Spirituality (not necessarily the dogmatic sort that keeps us in the submissive, non-living, non-aware state!) This book is not for the person too busy to have time to digest something wonderfully deep and enriching! Reading it is like taking a shower in the purest, cleansing water, and emerging to absorb its message like rays of powerful sunshine! It is empowering. A fantastic door opening to the possibilities of our becoming a truly free and healthy society of thinking, alive, deprogrammed individuals! Read this one before any of her other books! Her newly coined terms will become valuable assets in your vocabulary and liberated mind-set 
This is a top book. It analyses the addiction patterns of individuals from the perspective of the addictive patterns in society as a whole. Ann Wilson Schaef goes beyond analysis of the "problem" of addiction to a very encouraging vision of another way of being alive, one that is mostly forgotten in our numb modern society. If you are looking for some ways out of the cycle of addiction, this may be an important roadmap for you 
This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from "addiction". The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system 
Due to the pressures of modern life, many people are addicts of one kind or another.Anne Schaef shows how society as a whole behaves in addictive ways.We usually think of an addict as being someone addicted to a drug, but there are many kinds of addiction.There are substance addictions, such as to alcohol, drugs, nicotine, caffeine and food.Everyday activities can become process addictions,such as accumulating money,gambling, sex,work,religion and worry.Personal relationships can also be addictive.Many politicians behave like addicts,as they are hooked on control, promising things will get better(but they do not)denying problems and denying alternative ways of doing things.This all adds up to the Addictive System which is modern society.Schaef concludes that "we cannot allow anything to come between us and our spirituality, or between us and our living process.If we do, we shall destroy ourselves and those around us."This is a very worthwhile book, with penetrating insight into modern life 
Jim Hightower pulls no punches in this revealing expose of how dirty our two-party system is. He provides example after example of how corporations have seized complete control of the government, taking power away from the citizenry. Sure, the rich have always enjoyed certain privelges that the rest of us don't. But in the last twenty years, there has been a growing, unbridled greed that is destroying the lives of millions for the benefit of a handful of modern-day robber barons. The vast majority of Democrats and Republicans have been bought and paid for by these insulated tycoons -- ever wonder about rich guys and corporations who give the maximum contribution to the Democrat and the Republican in the same race? You can bet that it ain't civic pride. If you are tired of working two jobs, and never getting ahead, this book will explain the truth about what is happening 
If you're tired of the non-news you are fed every night on the evening "news" show, get this book. Did you know that the average worker now makes less than in 1973 in inflation-adjusted wages? Did you know that NAFTA has hurt American farmers and American workers, not helped them? Jim Hightower gives you real news in his book. Why waste money on your local paper when it consists of nothing but corporate press releases? This book shows how publicly financed elections cost less than the favors and giveaways your politicians provide to big campaign contributors. This book is fun to read, too, in spite of the serious content, and would be a great gift for family and friends, both left and right wingers 
When I first picked up this book I was immediately reminded of the 'AMOK 4th Dispatch' catalogue. Back in 1989 the AMOK bookstore out of L.A. released a sourcebook for the extremes of information in print. The book was an unbelievable find, a real jewel in the pre-internet age. Virtually every author who appeared in the 'PULPS' section of that catalogue has found themselves listed in this new ROUGH GUIDE. For anyone who is tired of the bestseller lists and is looking for something different to read, this guidebook is indispensable! It features all the offbeat, wonderful authors who can lay claim to breaking new ground in literature. Some are well known bestselling authors (Vonnegut, Camus, Tolkien, Ellroy, Palahniuk, Pynchon), others are celebrated more for their lifestyles than their actual work (the infinitely emulated Kerouac, Bukowski and Henry Miller), still others are infamous (Selby, de Sade, Burroughs, Beirce) while many, many others have been either criminally ignored, forgotten or just faded with time (Crews, Himes, Mishima, Bowles, Dick, Willeford, Trocchi, Gysin et al.) All have devoted (some would say slavish) readerships that have allowed for their works to remain in print one way or the other over the years. I have many of the writers in this collection but the real treasures are to be found with some of the other entries in the guide. You're bound to discover several new writers in this collection which, along with some extra facts that you may not have known about some of your favourite authors, makes it well worth buying. Some of you who haven't yet delved into the literary underworld are in for a real treat. I envy your upcoming voyage of discovery. The guide is set up simply and efficiently. It covers over 200 novelists but also branches out to include classic cult books by authors who never became cult figures themselves, as well as graphic novels, beloved characters, non-fiction faves and even some trivia. I know about most of the authors mentioned in the book but there were still quite a few surprises as well as some illuminating facts, bios and recommended reads that made it well worth buying. I highly, highly recommend this guide for people who are ready to branch out from the bestsellers, the old classics and mainstream pulp. A whole new world of ideas awaits.. 
First, a word about the term cult fiction, and its implications. When I first saw the title of this little book, I assumed it would be full of strung-out wreckages like Burroughs and Dick. While the Rough Guide does contain them (as it should), its scope is far greater than writers of that type. In here you'll find a wind range of novelists reviewed, including Graham Greene, John Fowles, even Zane Grey. Bottom line: an excellent resource for readers 
I picked this up on a recent vacation to Minnapolis and found I couldn't put it down. I do think the book does omit some key cult writers but the ones who are included are handled by writers who obviously know their subjects. This guide includes a lot of my favorite writers (Jonathan Coe, Italo Calvino, Jasper Fforde, Borges, etc.) and I was pleased to find out some things about their lives and work that I didn't know before. The guide points out the writers' essential works and suggests what a particular writer might have in common with another writer. The book is often funny without being mean-spirited 
Let's face it. Most books about writing are b o r i n g. They usually range from dry to ... dry. I've often thought of this as a case of "physician, heal thyself." Ryan's ridiculously long title made me wonder if his book would land squarely in the middle of that dry pile. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong: Ryan has a straightforward and practical approach to writing. In fact, he goes as far as to talk about writer's intuition, and dares to promote a straightforward writing approach, "Plan Then Write." This book talks about general corporate writing, but the information can be applied to other types of writing where we need to remember that every word we write, whether in team communication or in our work product, is an opportunity. This book is great for less experienced writers trying to find structure in a formless void. And it is perhaps equally valuable for experienced writers who are trying to call themselves back to the basics 
This book tells the two real secrets that create good business writing, rule of thumb and writer's intuition. It also shares a very special secret in all good writing, how to avoid the rule-burdened mechanics-based approach that ruins most writers before they begin. 
Another book about writing well? Who needs it, you ask? My answer is: Anyone who wants to write better. Those who want to be better writers must continually practice their skills. Sure, you could probably improve your style without this book, but why not learn a few more tricks of the trade? I especially enjoyed the rewrite examples ("Rewriting History" was particularly interesting). Expend a bit of energy reading and studying Ryan's book and then expect to write with a bit more ease. Someone once commented that even good writers need perpetual reassurance. "Write Up the Corporate Ladder" is that reassurance 
At last a clear and practical book that gets right down to the real issues. Excellent writing skills are critical to success in today's world. Ryan gives proven and valuable steps to bring your writing to a new level of clarity and conciseness. A real must have book 
With time becoming more valuable each day, and email evolving as the convenient mode of communication, people tend to rush through common and simple memos and correspondence which can lead to bad writing habits and the potential for costly mistakes. Now that we have the technology to simplify communication, it's time to upgrade our own communication skills to avoid the pitfalls and re-focus upon what we're trying to say. Kevin Ryan not only gives us the tools to improve our writing but he introduces us to successful people who already have. I write back cover promotional pieces for a book publisher and I've cut hours from the amount of time it takes to create new, fresh and clear copy. Here's a book that's right for the times 
13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale. I think I've had enough of his novels 
Quick read that's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children, and how that impacts the adult lives of those children. Iles has quickly become a favorite author of mine, with Turning Angel being the first book I read, and this being the second. I look forward to reading his other works 
Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes? Of course not! Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long. The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead. The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book. All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text. Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on. Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely. Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before? Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
If you're interested in forensics, chances are you'll like this book. The book also manages to tie in sexual abuse, repressed memories, Miss., Vietnam, PTSD, and a little romance. It even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long. I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book's plot and discussions as intricate as they are 
Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book. I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender. I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side. The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie. In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen. As an aside, I remain amazed and impressed that Iles can so effectively write a novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of sexual abuse. Not a five star, but a solid four. 
Turning Angel was a page turner for me so I bought BLood Memory. WOW! It did not disappoint me 
This was a very good book. I just kept turning the pages. This is the first I have read by this author and I was very impressed. After about the first 100 pages it really takes off. I am glad a friend loaned it to me. To bad it tok me over a year before I opened it. 
I guess it's high praise for Mr. Iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child: free-diving, drinking, Valium, baths in scalding water. This was a thoroughly gripping book that at 764 pages long, I was sad to see come to an end. Greg Iles doesn't shy from the sensitive subject of pedophilia and tackles it with unflinching honesty. There is no way to guess the NOMURS "bad guy" in this book til the very end (I don't care what the Australian said who apparently solved the mystery in the first chapter) but I'm disappointed that the author did not interweave the Natchez and New Orleans crimes better. It does get repetitive like some said, but I still highly recommend this book if you're looking for a taut, atmospheric suspense mystery. Very well-written and fresh 
one of the boldest of the bold. kudos to mr. iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists. nambla has been put on notice. this is work of pure satisfaction, from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero, cat. another worthy pile of words from mr. iles, despite his ignorance regarding black people. the dialog is downright embarrassing, but keep trying mr. iles. if you hang out with african-americans rather than watch them on tv, perhaps you'll get 5 stars next time 
This is the first book I've read by Greg Iles. However, it will not be the last! This book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues. After reading this book I better understand my mother, who was sexually abused, and her response to my sexual abuse. She was able to sheild me from parental sexual abuse, but not from my (then) boyfriend. I found it very helpful that Mr. Iles gave contact numbers and information at the end of the book regarding sexual abuse. This book will help you to see the tell-tale signs of abuse if you, like Cat Ferry, are willing and able to open your mind to the truth of what you witness 
As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse I found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person. This book will stick with me a long time and I hope even though it is long, readers will give it the chance it deserves. I thought this work by Mr. Iles to be very insightful. 
Read this book at a light warehouse because you will NOT want to be anywhere near the dark! 
IT is one of my favorite Stephen King novels I've ever read. Possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books. It is extremely long and I must admit that I had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it. I know it's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice. Of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long. This novel has some of the best character development I've ever read and the reader gets a chance to really get to know each character. Even a chance to know more about each character that you might care to. Highly recommended even if you aren't a King fan 
When I first read this book, upon finishing it I immediately proceeded to rip it's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces. That was how much the story affected me. It disgusted me, it disturbed me, it ... moved me. After brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head, and if that's not the mark of a great writer I don't know what is. I then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again. Amid all the horror that Stephen King has unleashed from the darkness of his imagination, this has to be the most disturbing, disgusting and, at times, offensive work he has ever set to paper. Forget the movie... this is high octane writing which will leave you gasping for breath. With this book and "The Tommyknockers," Stephen King has proven that he is not just a great horror story writer, but a GREAT writer... period. Buy it, read it. 
Although I'm only 14 year old boy who lives in Utah, I've been a die hard Stephen King fan since I was twelve, and I have to say, this is really the high light of his career. Don't be turned off by the massive length of this book, it goes by very quickly, and you'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages. As I'm sure you know, this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges. Other people have already gone over the basic story, but one thing that most of them failed to mention that I find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it, all of them But Mike Hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it. Yes, this book is vulgar, it is violent, and there is some sexuality, it is an essential part of the story. It is over a thousand pages long, and each page is genius. I will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book I've ever read, because it's so much more than a horror story. I think this book has greater characters than any other book I have ever read. This is a five star book, and is almost completely flawless. This is my favorite book, and some of Stephen King's other great works are The Dead Zone, Misery, The Shining, and Christine. Read this book, it is well worth your time, I won't go in depth into the story, because hundreds of other people already have, but this book will scare the piss out of you, make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it, and really just change you. I can't express in words how great this is, but don't take my word for it. Buy it, rent it, whatever, just READ IT (no pun intended). ~Love, Dallas~ 
Wow, what an epic. The book draws you in to the sinister world of Derry Maine so quickly, and deeply, that you don't want to leave when the last page is read. With a book so large in volume and scope each reader is bound to find faults with the story, but this world is so full of rich characters, these problems disappear into the pages and eventually vanish. I originally read this book in High School. After my first re-read 15 years later, the horror of the what goes on in the town of Derry every 28 years had a bigger impact on me. However, the adventure and wonderment I pulled from the story then, came flooding back again. The first half of the book is a coming of age story, with evil stalking the town as a backdrop. The second half of the book is a story of re-discovery and responsibility, with evil lurking closer in each character's shadows. Just a fantastic book that reminds the reader of the power we had as children 
A book that enables you to travel back in time...back to 1958, back to a time when there was Stan, Mike, Richie, Bev, Eddie, Ben and Big Bill and some others...back when some kids' main concern was avoiding Henry Bowers! A story that, although long...over a thousand pages and in 'IT' years probably much longer, kept my attention throughout. Maybe you'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals...the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse, the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear...fear of the unknown...and fear of the known. A chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences, so that you really care what happens to them - good AND bad! 
I wish this book had been available when I was 30 years younger as it might have helped me avoid some serious life errors. I would have even been happy if this book was available when my daughter married 8 years ago. However, even though the gems of wisdom came too late for us, I recommend that all brides and wives read this book if they want to learn to improve their life, being supportive of their husband yet never giving up their right to be treated well. Robin McGraw strikes just the right balance of compassion and determination. It is instructional without being "preachy" - though best for Christians the wisdom could apply to women of any or no formal religious faith. It would be a good idea for young grooms to read this too (to get an insiders view from the other side). I bought the book because of the show on Dr. Phil about the book (okay I confess I wanted to read the "dirt" on Dr. Phil) but it was a delight in that you got the "dirt" but learned that the truth was given with a heaping helping of compassion. I don't know if I would enjoy hanging out with Dr. Phil (he is intense) but I think I would love Robin. She admits to what she did wrong and tells women how they can find their voice to make the best life possible for themselves and their families. If your life isn't perfect (and I've yet to find anyone whose life is) then read the book, and if you agree pass it on to your sisters (biological or otherwise). Here's to McGraw family values!!! 
I loved Robin McGraw's book! Her message regarding relationships, husbands, children and life in general is an important lesson for all of us. Life can throw all sorts of roadblocks before us, but if we trust in God and try to maintain a positive attitude, we will triumph over them. I feel that Robin wants all of us to experience the joys that are just waiting for us in life. Thank you, Robin, for sharing your story with us. 
I didn't like this book. I thought it was a waste of time and money. 
This is a fabulous book filled with common sense (which is not so common, after all!). Robin shares her perspective on being a wife, mother, daughter, daughter in law and most of all a woman. It's not a "self help" book, but more of a "this is how I did it, you can do it too" book. I really liked that she spoke about how women need to put themselves first (self care) on all levels to fill whatever roles we need. And the personal devastation she went through in her own life because people around her didn't do this. 
I DID NOT order this book and I DID NOT authorize a charge to my credit car 
I loved this book and couldn't put it down, I read it in two days. I wish I had a book like this to read when I was younger. I recommed it to all young women and to older women too, we are never to old to learn. I just ordered another copy for my youngest daughter as I didn't want to give my copy up. Thank you Robin for sharing with us 
To be honest with you I only received the books I ordered yesterday and I had no intensions to read the book by Mrs. Edwards. I bought the books for my two adult daughters as Christmas presents. However, I heard Mrs. Edwards talking about her life and I assume the book on some TV program and was quite impressed with what she had to say. My daughters are young adults and have not had to experience much loss or troubles in their lives. I think Mrs. Edwards relates to women that will help them through touch times in their lives and I would like my children to be able to handle those times as well as Mrs. Edwards did and does. She seems to be a strong and well adjusted person. By the way, I wouldn't mind reading the book myself and I am the father of the daughters mentioned above 
This is an amazing book that EVERY WOMAN should read and or listen to.....Robin McGraw is an incredable individual and Dr. Phil should be very proud to have her for his WIFE! The show now should be the "Robin and Dr. Phil Show" for Robin has as much to give to us as Dr. Phil for "woman with passion and purpose" 
Excellent topic for woman of all ages. This showes woman how to be strong without being masculine and threatening their partener 
Tina is molested by her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father, until her mother finally tells her that he isn't. Tina is vague about the details of the abuse and doesn't actually say what happened, so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went. She prays to God many times to make it stop (why'd he let it start in the first place?), but God is not listening at those times. Finally after many years of this abuse, her mother catches them together, and instead of kicking him out, sends her daughter to a school out of town, with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day. The Lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together, and they don't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he's sorry (sorry that he got caught). Says it's just something about Tina that makes him do it. Make sense? The mother works at Kmart and likes to have kids she doesn't care about, and the dad works "in an office". The rest of her growing up is fairly normal. She has a boyfriend and he kisses someone else. Ouch. She goes off the college, and finds out her high school boyfriend is seeing her best friend. Tina doesn't seem too upset by this, she's busy with college and new friends anyway. Then he comes to visit her, tells her he got the other girl pregnant, but he really loves her. She quickly moves in with him. The other girl's pregnancy or resulting child is so unimportant that it is NEVER mentioned again. In due time, Tina gets pregnant by him and has an abortion. She says she regrets it. Gets pregnant by him again, has another abortion. Regrets this one too. However, she never talks about what her life would be like if she DID have these two kids by this loser. Nope, it just was wrong and she wishes she'd never done it, but never takes responsibility that is was her decision based on the circumstances she was in at the time. Having an abortion is just SO wrong, that you don't have to think about the consequences of actually having the baby. She seems to put the "blame" for her two abortions on society. Talks her unmarried sister into keeping her unplanned pregnancy. Breaks up with the impregnating loser, meets a "normal" guy. He wants to marry her, they plan big wedding with white dress and bridesmaids. She thinks she doesn't really love him, calls mother to discuss (why bother?). Mom tells her she better get married to this great guy. Tina decides she ought to do it in a few days before she changes her mind. Buys BLACK dress to get married in. Has small wedding. Has finished college, and EVERY job she wants, she GETS. Whines about working and traveling, so tired. Persuades husband to go back to college and get degree in engineering. Husband is so smart that he figures finances and tells her they can afford a house. Has baby girl, his parents buy a crib she doesn't like (of all the nerve!). His mother tries to take over (helping too much)and Tina gets frustrated but won't tell her off. How much can a person be expected to take? Husband tells her she doesn't have to work anymore. They buy bigger newer house. Tina whines about packing and moving, so much work. Gets pregnant with second baby (never notices when she's pregnant, always thinks she has a stomach virus). Getting depressed and tired with being pregnant and cleaning house, starts sitting in hot tub every night. Guess doctor didn't tell her this is bad for baby as it raises baby's temperature too much (already hot inside mother's body). Slips and falls on icy deck (not good idea to be walking on while pregnant), hurts back, whines some more. Has second baby, too depressed and physically in pain to take care of self or both children. Medication not helping. Asks mom for help, she refuses, has to "watch stocks on TV for boyfriend" (has left husband finally). Guess husband's family doesn't want to help now? Church people help some, not enough for her. Husband begs her mom to help. She does. Twice. Apparently husband cannot figure out that he should put both kids in daycare while he works, pick them up after work, then take care of them himself when they go home (just like a single mom does!) Never enters his head. While Tina is at mom's house (not too depressed to drive or go to mom's house), mom tells her to "snap out of it". This makes Tina snap for real, she jumps in car, drives to bridge, tries to jump off. Cop grabs her (pictures are terrible, can't see what happened. Picture of car on bridge, wow). Finally starts going to therapist, but her "faith" (now) helps more. Discovers "uplifting" Christian CD's. Faces fact that she and mom will never have mother/daughter relationship the way she wants it. Says mom saw her as rival for husband instead of daughter she should have protected. That's true. This book is short (I read it at the bookstore), and its main focus is if you get Christ in your life, your depression will be lifted. But that makes no sense as she was praying and going to church all her life. Tina was searching, yes, but expecting to find the answer to her problems with God. This did not help before, and she seems to have tried to adjust things in her mind to make it that way after the bridge incident. The whole time she needed to look INSIDE herself. Yes, the abuse never should have happened, her mother was a terrible person, and all this affected her self-esteem. But she won't deal with it, won't get angry at mom or stepdad. Apparently she never sees any self-help books or anything like that, and relies solely on church and her "beliefs" to get her emotions in check (and this appears to be a very ineffective solution). By the way, Tina mentions that she cannot get physically helped by Reiki because it conflicts too much with the beliefs she's had all her life. The beliefs she's had ever since she was a child molested by her stepfather. Tina's not much of a one for upgrading her beliefs, which leads her to feeling stuck in certain situations. Tina had a lot of things to be grateful for: nice husband and provider, didn't have to work, nice house, healthy kids, nice in-laws, college education, but she is not appreciative. Tina's almost constant whining about things that would seem very small to anyone else, negated any effect this book could have had on me as portraying a mother depressed enough to jump off a bridge. She just seemed spoiled to me. For such a deep subject, this book lacked substance and seemed to tiptoe around the issues. There is no calling a spade a spade - the whole thing is superficially written. Anyone who's had to deal with real problems, especially while depressed, will not "get" this book 
If you've ever been suicidally depressed like Tina, which I have, then this book may well change your whole life! The power of Tina's story is in the simplicity of her words, and the courage of her traumatized soul. I found myself crying from time to time while reading this book because it touched so many chords in my own broken heart. The fact that God used a patrolman to save her life is just one part of this incredibly moving and unforgettable story. I had never heard of Tina Zahn until I read this book, and now I can't stop telling people, especially those who are struggling with depression and trauma issues to read this book! You won't regret reading it either, I assure you it will speak to your heart in a graphic but tender way 
This is a great book for anyone who has ever battled depression or knows someone who has. It really hit home for me and while I never went as far as to take my own life, I felt many of the feelings she describes after the birth of my second child. It's nice to know you are not alone. Thank you for sharing your story of hope and healing. MOPS was also a saving grace for me in my struggles as well. THANKS MOPS!! 
Women especially will connect with this book, whether they've experienced postpartum depression or not. As I read it, I realized how many women in my own life had experienced abuse, rejection, and depression that was so debilitating they considered taking their own life. You'll want to read this book for yourself and recommend it to others to share in Tina's struggles, her miraculous rescue, and her ultimate triumph through faith, medical help, and the support of her friends and her husband. A great read that you won't forget 
I have read literally thousands of books in my lifetime, but I have never read a book quite like this. First, I am from Wisconsin and have actually been to many of the places that Tina mentions in her story. Second, I too have struggled for many years with serious depression. I've never actually attempted suicide, but I came very close to it one night 10 years ago. It is only by the grace of God that I didn't attempt suicide that night. I truly believe that God intervened in my life that night. Even though I didn't yet know Christ as my Savior. I have struggled with serious depression off and on for the past 15 years. There have been five or six periods in my life where I have felt seriously depressed for months at a time. There is definitely a stigma in the church when it comes to depression. A lot of people simply don't know how to handle it. I could relate to so many of Tina's struggles. Tina's story is also my story. I am so thankful that Tina had the courage and strength to share such a deeply personal struggle with the world. I believe that this book will give hope to those of us who struggle with depression. But I believe it will also help those who have never had a problem with depression to be more compassionate and understanding. Struggling with serious depression can make you feel so alone and like there is no one who really understands. But this book showed me that I am not alone in my struggles and that even if no one else does, God understands and cares. I cried numerous times as I read this book. This book has helped me believe that there is hope and help is available. I do not have to suffer alone. Reading Tina's story also makes me want to begin counseling in order to deal with my depression and other issues openly and honestly. I thank God for sparing Tina's life and motivating her to share her story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to people who struggle with depression. I also recommend this book to friends and family of people who are depressed. I thank God for motivating me to buy this book. This is one book I know I will never forget. 
This is an amazing story. Thank God, Tina Zahn lived to tell it. In this well-written and easy-to-read account of a troubled life that eventually leads to an attempted suicide, we learn the true story behind the sensational headlines/video footage of a young woman's leap from Wisconsin's tallest bridge. Battling severe postpartum depression after the birth of her second child, coupled with unresolved traumas of sexual abuse by her stepfather that began at the tender age of five, we indeed learn why Tina Zahn jumped. Remarkably, all the elements were in place to rescue her. The book begins with the dramatic call to 9-1-1 by her husband and the ensuing high-speed police chase, along with the swift actions of the officer who reached out and grabbed her wrist, saving her from a 200-foot plunge and certain death. She then goes back in time and tells the wrenching account of her stepfather's abuses (she didn't discover he wasn't her biological father until many years later) and her mother's neglect. One can't help but applaud Zahn's bravery for sharing her story and for including useful reference material at the end to help us all recognize the signs of sexual abuse and depression, and where to go for help. This is a spiritual journey and I recommend it not only for readers learning to diagnose signs of depression (postpartum and otherwise), but also to attain a greater understanding of these illnesses and how to cope with loved ones who may be suffering. Readable in an afternoon. From the author of "A Line Between Friends," McKenna Publishing Group 
I saw Tina Zahn on Oprah, so I bought the book for my sister and I to read. Tina grew up in a rough family. I think her Step-Father should be shot and her sister and mother are insensitive. Tina Zahn is a true survivor and an inspiration to mothers who may suffer from Post Partum Depression. 
I cannot say enough good things about this book. This series is some of the best writing James Patterson has ever done! Not only am I totally hooked, but my daughter, grandaughter, and tons of her friends are as well. This book has made the rounds through all of us and my grandaughter's other middle school friends are begging to borrow it as well. If you haven't read the Maximum Ride series yet, PLEASE grab Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment FIRST then move straight on to this one. All I can say is - I can't wait for the next installment! 
I purchsed this book, as well as Maximum Ride Angel Experiment. I read them both before giving them to my children to read. I found them to be "clean" of sex,language and violence. We all throughly enjoyed them and would recommend them to any child who likes fantasy and drama 
As an adult, I picked this book up for my daughter and began looking over it in the car. Before I knew it I had read the whole thing and wanted to read the first book in the series. My daughter and I both really liked it, sci-fi, adventure, and a little romance thrown in just for fun 
I have really enjoyed both books about Max that James Patterson has written. Although he has created a unique family due to their scientific beginnings, they continue to face similuar issues that many young people and diverse families face. I can't wait for Mr. Patterson's next version of life as only Max knows it 
After I read the first installment, I passed it along to my 13 year old daughter. She has never been an avid reader, but she could not put that book down. I ordered this one specifically so she would continue reading over the summer. She enjoyed this one just as much. After her friends got through reading the books, I finally got it back and found this to be a very entertaining book as well. People can not believe that I would give a James Patterson book to my 13 year old. This is well suited for that age group. I highly recommend it 
Best book in the series yet - Adults like it as much as the kid 
To the brilliant mind of Lincoln Rhyme it becomes apparent early into the murder investigation that there are two killers involved, working in tandem and perhaps one in slave to the other. A ticking clock is left at the first puzzling murder scene at the docks, and it at first appears as if someone has been suspended until their painful death finally relieves them of their agony. It's nasty, and its attention grabbing to a city that will always forever after be hyper aware of the danger in the every day. A careful killer is calling himself "The Watchmaker", but for the investigating team that all seems a little obvious. There are plenty of crime scenes, but where are the bodies?  Police forensic consultant and former Detective Lincoln Rhyme as always feels immense frustration that he is not out there with his team, walking his own personally devised murder scene "grid" and so must take some satisfaction in that his best eyes and ears, Amelia Sachs, is out there to do it for him. Sachs has her eye on some future goal that might not involve police work, and this is despite the fact that she is riding her first case as Lead homicide Detective. Some of those in the department have always wanted the bright Amelia Sachs to fall from a great height and when her current case leads her down the road into her father's own policing past, she is more able to understand why.  Deaver is a master at suspense, and the ticking clock element to this novel is only a small part of that. There are always so many layers to the Lincoln Rhyme novel that it's delightful to have the knowledge that an early answer will never be THE answer; Deaver we expect to always work the suspense screws skifully right up until the final pages. This is a better novel than the previous one or two in the series which puzzled more than entertained. THE COLD MOON is more tightly crafted with greater cohesion between merging plotlines (which there always seems to be) and less extraneous elements are involved. This series isn't read for the warm and fuzzy character development and stripping it all back down to the action of the escalating hunt has made for a far better read.  On the flip side of this some of the personal issues have been dragged out too far in the series and need to be dealt with. Fans of the series need to have resolution on teasers that were introduced many novels ago, and a retrospective novel probably wouldn't be a bad inclusion either (not an original thought, but would probably be timely).  If you haven't read a Jeffery Deaver novel before, THE COLD MOON would give you a good feel for the series and Deaver makes solid work of providing enough supporting information to enable his books to be read as stand alones. A great book in a stellar series that still has no peer.  
It's been awhile since I had a really good crime mystery read. Therefore, I was excited when The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver arrived at the library. The latest Lincoln Rhyme novel delivered just what I was looking for... twists, turns, and plenty of forensic work. The plotline here starts out on two tracks. A killer nicknamed The Watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques. His signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene. Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, his partner, are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die. Sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder. The murder points to a run-down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis. There's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt, so Sachs has to step carefully as it's not clear who she can trust. The two cases converge when The Watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that Sachs is investigating. But the layering of deception goes even deeper than that, and Rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind The Watchmaker... If you want plot twists and turns, this book will definitely satisfy. There are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion, only to be something else entirely. The layering of plots by the killer never seems to end, and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction. A couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top, but not so much as to put me off the story. It's a book I really didn't want to put down, even though I had other things I should be doing.. 
After 2-3 terrible Lincoln Rhyme books Deaver gets his act together in The Cold Moon. As a big Lincoln fan, I am hoping this continues, as I was ready to stop buying Rhyme books. If you haven't already read Bone Collector, Empty Chair and Coffin Dancer, you're missing out 
Although the plot twists in Deaver books sometimes are a bit of a stretch; they are certainly never dull. This books has more twists that a pretzel factory. I never divulge plots when reviewing. I would simply say this is a great mystery and well worth your time. Enjo 
A new Lincoln Rhyme novel brings the thriller genre to high tension, especially spiced with Joe Mantegna's readings. He's received Emmy nominations for his TV work and won the Tony Award for his stage work - there should be an award for his smooth voice which perfectly captures the tension brewing from the story of deadly murders in New York City and a renowned criminologist who comes to realize the killer's future plans. This is audio at its best. Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc 
I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility. Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow. Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case. The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development. The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks. The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs. At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as, "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way. This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries. 
A number of reviewers have complained about this book saying that it really wouldn't happen this way, that the twists and turns of the plot which is a staple with Mr. Deaver are too far fetched to believe. Well of course it is not believable. The police are not going to go to an outsider for forensic work unless it is with one of the big well known firms who will give them credibility when it comes to court. A working detective with the police department who discovers dirty cops is going to be hated throughout the department. Need I go on? The answer is, BUT SO WHAT. Here is a well told, if somewhat familar, tale about a detective, his sidekick, a serial murderer, a truly evil bad guy, twists and turns aplenty,and an overall very enjoyable read. I'd suggest that you read all the Lincoln Rhyme novels in the sequence they were published. The characters do grow and change somewhat as the books progress. Still, each of his books stands alone as a pretty good way to spend a cold weekend or a long airplane flight 
My first Deaver -- I want more. Also my first book review. The book was really fun to read but I agree with some of the other reviewers here who said the plot twists strained credulity. Still, I love the way Deaver paints people so vividly, and scenes, and the conversations made me laugh. He's a master at this. Katherine Dance for instance -- she was the cop from California who helped interview the suspects. Now my question is: Is there really such an interview technique as the one she uses throughout the book? I did a few searches, nothing came up so far. Very interesting. Anyway, that's my review. I recommend the book basically, despite the mazelike plot. I've found a new favorite author. 
This unique book tells the story of a bunch of intrepid and inspired men who pioneered the exploration of the last great unknown: the deeps of the sea. How would you fancy wading out under water with nothing more than an inverted coal bucket over your head? Would you agree to a fight a shark, equipped with nothing more than a knife, all so that some movie company could film the gory encounter? Inventive, adventurous, foolhardy to the point of recklessness, many of the diving pioneers were also world-famous in their own right, like the great biologist JBS Haldane, who worked out how to survive at dangerous depths. Others evolved from treasure seekers to become the first underwater archaeologists, exploring ancient shipwrecks in exotic waters, or, most interesting of all, opening our eyes to the beauty of marine habits and wildlife, including the seriously threatened coral reefs. The author, himself a marine biologist and diver, blends all this into a magical weave of fact and wonder enlivened by a mordant wit and a delightful eye for quirky detail. I would recommend it to any reader 
Fast shipping and great shape. The only problem we had was that the cd inside the book was for indesign instead of photoshop 
This book is very easy to follow. Each chapter begins by telling you what it will cover and how long it will take to complete. The book comes with a CD which contains lesson plans for each chapter. The object is to have you work along as the chapter progresses giving you some hands-on practice. It is definitely a useful resource for the beginner Photoshop student 
Quite honest book and matches with any beginner's expectation. CD works really fine illustrating each and every example. Should the reader classify himself as a Photo Shop regular user, Scott Kelby "The photoshop CS2 book" will be more aggressive 
I purchased this book for my class, and I was not disappointed. I knew very little about Photoshop when I started my online class, and I felt that this book was very helpful and answered pretty much all my beginner-Photoshop user questions. I would recommend this book for people who want to learn the basics about using Photoshop 
Im a college student, ive taken multiple classes that were supposed to "teach" us software via textbooks and this is by far the easiest book to follow. I have no formal experience with the software, i just bought it recently because this is the last year i will be able to take advantage of a student discount on software, and i thought it would come in handy... ive burned thru the first 1/2 of the book in 3 nites, prolly 2 hours a nite.. Its not tedious at all, very straight forward and color illustrated step by step... They give you the keyboard shortcuts, as well as the pull down menu commands upfront, and it guides you through the things you will actually use without alot of b.s. i will be ordering the rest of the series on adobe software to learn the rest of the web bundle, probably the best $45 ive spent on textbooks yet 
I've tried learning photoshop many times before, but each book I read made me loose interest. This book is fun, and arranged in a way so that lessons are neither too long nor too short 
Adobe's instruction book are: very basic, and . . . boring. Get Deke's books--you'll be glad you did 
This is the 12th or 13th book I have purchased about Photoshop. I wish it had been my first purchase, because I am finally now learning the "ins" and "outs" of Adobe's Photoshop CS2. When I finish the lessons and projects in this book, I believe the other books on the same subject will be easy to understand 
This is definitely a hands on book. The clear color pictures and illustrations are rather concise and informing. I am about in the middle of the book now and am already tweaking family photos 
The Classroom in a Book Series is great for describing functions and tools a user would otherwise not become familiar with. However, the Illustrator text is more accurate in describing how the software responds. That is, some settings and functions do not work like or are not housed where described in the Photoshop text. Still, the book is useful, and I'm happy with it's use as a resource 
I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection. So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
THis book was horrible. If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have. I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend. I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire. One less copy in the world...don't waste your money. I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes. THis book wasted my life 
If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird. After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people. Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time. I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told. This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing. I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it. But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did. I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat. 
I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through 
This book is great. Augusten Burroughs is genius, and a great storyteller! I couldn't put it down 
What happened to American girls, to women, over the past hundred years, that caused a quantum shift in how they present themselves to the world? Intelligence, spirituality, charity and volunteerism, and skills for all things domestic were once revered. The most popular girl in her class wasn't the prettiest girl. The girl considered best for marriage had the qualities desired for a wife and mother and not what she looked like on her husband's arm. We are all victims of this shift. I admit I first noticed this book on a shelf in a train-station bookstore because of the flat, tanned belly on the cover. We've become a society obsessed with pieces and parts and appearances of the pieces and parts rather than the beauty of the whole person. Our self-esteem is measured by the numbers on the scale or the size of our jeans or the clarity of our skin. Over the past six years, I've reread this book a few times, and always find a new point that rings true. In her revealing (yet not surprising) sociological history Blumberg uses the best and most frank sources to illustrate her case: the private diaries of young women, from the Victorian era to present day (the late 90's). Blumberg theorizes that it's the media and consumerism that are the biggest contributors to the shift and uses excerpts from the diaries to make her point. Blumberg focuses on middle-class Caucasian girls circa 1998, and perhaps the book needs an update to focus on a broader demographic as well as address the influence of the internet which has since become an increasingly important factor in the socialization and self-awareness of young women. I think this is a decent book for a teenage girl, but I'm not sure it will have much of a positive influence. Girls are constantly being fed about how they should look and what products they should buy to achieve beauty. It's a better book for a woman in her 20's or 30's who might want a better understanding of why we've become the way we are 
The Body Project provides very selective leeway into the societal effects of African-American adolescent girls and their personal body projects. The main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white middle-class adolescent girl throughout American history. African-American and Jewish girls are mentioned briefly in a few chapters, while other ethnic groups are simply never discussed. Are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in Brumberg's book? Brumberg focuses on the evolution of the white middle-class female adolescent starting in the early 1800s and ending in the late 1990s. An evolution of the African American adolescent also took place during these times, but differently than that of their white female counterparts. In order to understand black American adolescents today, foundation for cultural practices must first be established. Brumberg never mentions the coexistence of enslaved blacks, in America during the 18th or 19th centuries. Though all women have the same biological anatomy, our genes vary, our cultures vary, so we should dispel the idea that when certain groups of women who menstruate earlier than others are abnormal or inferior. Brumberg reveals that this type of thought was well circulated throughout the medical community remained true during the Victorian period. The notion that black health was considered an expendable asset in the American medical community well through the early 1970s. One major issue that Brumberg avoids is the abuse of children and adolescents. There is probably a close connection between the body projects that adolescents undertake and their harsh self-image. Brumberg fails to expand on the greater idea that people exist who can never truly choose their identity before it first chooses them. Many girls are intrinsically bound to a stereotype, despite self-image. Possibly everyone has small things that they would like to alter about their physical appearances; however Americans also fail to see these "body projects" as a form a western female mutilation, of which millions of women have fallen victim. Plastic surgery is an ever-growing project that young girls obsess about. This standard idea of beauty that girls manipulate themselves on must disappear, before our individuality as women disappears. 
This book was referenced in a text that I read regarding teen sexuality, and since the reference sounded interesting I found a copy of it. Brumberg discusses here what she calls the "body projects" of teenage and adult women and how these projects have changed over time. By "body projects" she means what women are focused on changing about themselves at a particular place in history, whether it be the face, the body, or their sexuality. In describing these particular projects the author goes into detail about the history of menarche and menstruation, acne, and the hymen while also discussing the history of the social aspects of virginity and how female sexuality was (and is) perceived and discussed within a family and society. I really enjoyed reading this book for many reasons. First, it is rare that you can find a well-written social history text that covers such a variety of subjects. Second, the author uses diary entries from women from many different time periods to elucidate her points, and reading the first-person accounts of Victorian women can be very entertaining ("They thought what?!") while also enlightening and educational. Third, the author makes a major point to remind the reader that girls today are maturing earlier in a world filled with sexualized images and messages yet we are denying them education as to how to safely use these new bodies they have developed. She describes how we are doing our girls a disservice by not assisting them with creating their own moral codes and standards, which I very much agree with. I would suggest this book to any woman, especially a woman who has a daughter who is (or will be) a teenager. The dialogues that Brumberg suggests need to happen, and reading this book may spark that realization in all of us. 
Joan Jacobs Brumberg's The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls is a fascinating read. As an teacher and researcher on the field of young women and coming of age, I am quite pleased by the wealth of information, both scholarly and anecdotal, I learned from this book. Brumberg fleshes out an in-depth analysis of girls' body projects from the 1800s to the present day and supplements her vast research with diary accounts from young women throughout history. While I enjoyed this book, I did find a few parts to be undeveloped or perhaps glossed over. I am at odds with Brumberg's analysis in the section on "Pierced Parts." She seems to make rather hasty and unfounded conclusions about the symbolic significance of piercing among teenagers. I did not feel as though Brumberg was informed enough on the piercing phenomenon. On a positive note, this part of the book (and many others) will generate a lot of interesting discussion when I use it in the classroom. We will have to fill in the gaps Brumberg has left behind. Speaking of gaps, I also wish--but I can certainly understand the limitations and confines of academic research--that Brumberg had devoted more of her book to an analysis of the body projects among non-white women. While she did offer some interesting information on the body projects of African American, Jewish, and Latina women, I found myself aching for more than just a few token pages. The topic of women and their bodies has long been a benchmark of feminist inquiry and discussion. Brumberg's contribution to this topic, and her conceptualization of it as "the body project," provides new insight into an old yet persistent problem in our society. A fascinating and highly recommended read. 
In her book, Brumberg recognizes the struggles that young women go through in order to feel accepted in society, and discusses a variety of body projects ranging from acne troubles to anorexia. I think that most women today have felt the pressure that is driving them to make their bodies perfect, and therefore can relate their own lives directly to the situations that are presented. I found it interesting to read about the lives of many Victorian girls that had had problems so similar to my own and how they confronted those problems in very different ways. I found this book to be very informative and although it contained captivating information, Brumberg continually repeated her earlier thoughts in later chapters. I thought that she could have added more depth to her commentary to make her work a stronger piece of literature 
I learned a lot from this book about the history of how girls' bodies have overtime become more and more public. It is such a compelling read! This book has inspired me to do something to keep society from affecting my view of my own body, as well as for future women and girls 
This book was an amazing journey that helped me understand the underpinnings of the modern American woman's relationship with sexuality. By tracing the roots of our modern traditions to their Victorian foundations, Brumberg educates the reader and also paints a stark picture of the way young girls have started to come into their sexuality in the past few decades. She argues that girls today are out of sync, that their bodies develop before they are emotionally ready to deal with issues of sexuality. She further asserts (and proves, in my opinion) that the historical move away from home-based economies and social structures has robbed modern girls of vital mentoring from their adult female relatives. This lack of female mentoring leads to the confusion and insecurity that anyone who watches MTV cannot deny is rampant today. This book is an important read for educators, parents, and anyone interested in unerstanging how (and why) young women today experience sexualization by a culture all too ready to exploit their insecurities for profit. All in all, a fascinating and very readable study of a crucial subject 
Brumberg's work details the changes in cultural constructions of the adolescent body in the twentieth century, focusing on how young women create, maintain, and alter body images (and ultimately, body shapes/appearances). I use this book as the first monograph assignment in my introduction to women's studies course. Although the book has a strong theoretical framework, the descriptive examples in the chapters help to facilitate discussion in the class, which really sets the tone for the rest of the semester. College women find the book engaging, and they are very personally affected by the stories that relate so well to them. I find it an extremely informative, very useful book 
Dick Staub does a FABULOUS job of tying in the old teachings of the Bible with the very popular Star Wars Saga! This is an amazing book and it is very insightful. If you are looking to change your life and be a better Christian, this book is for you!!! This book is also great for people following Jediism who are Christian. I recommend with both thumbs up! Just an eloquent writer gifted with the ability to reach out to both adults and youth! A MUST read 
Dick Staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a Jedi in the ways of the Force in Star Wars and the walk of a Christian following God in life today. However, he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the Star Wars movies, and I even found a misquotation from the Bible. He makes good points, but these details were distracting to me as I read. I am not yet finished and will leave more once I am done. After finishing this book it occured to me that Dick Staub needs to take some time to do a couple of things. First he needs to re-read the Bible and get facts correct (He quoted Moses as saying something to Joshua, but Moses was dead at the time and God told it to Joshua). Second, he needs a simple commentary for the passages he misinterprets (He says David had Uriah killed to be the only one Bathsheba loved, He had Uriah killed to cover up his sin). Third he needs to re-watch the Star Wars movies and not bend the quotes of the characters to fit his book (He talks about Obi-Wan asking Yoda for help in Episode II and portrays the event differently than it happens, as well as bends Yoda's reaction to fit what he is trying to show). This book is not what I thought it was, and any Christian who is young in their walk should not read this. 
The book seems to miss the mark. It just seems like he thought he could slap star wars and christianity on it to make a quick buck. Hey these 2 things have made tons of money in the past right? Ok not a good idea to put the 2 things together. Get dharma of star wars and leave this book on the dark side 
I was very excited when I came across this book. I am both a Christian AND a Star Wars nut. I began reading this book right away, and it started slow. I kept reading, hoping it would really dive into some good contrast. It never came. I'm sure this guy meant well, but he had a very shallow knowledge of the Star Wars films, and on the Christian side, everything felt like it was from a 5th grade Sunday school class. I want so badly for this book to be great, but it is not. I wish I would have written it 
A good book that explores the Star Wars saga from a Christian perspective without compromising either faithfulness to Christian faith or to the Star Wars cosmology. I was troubled a bit by the many errors in this book---incorrect statements about biblical characters, Star Wars movies, as well as Lord of the Rings. Another book that follows a similar pathway---though from an angle that's more focused on the creative aspects of Star Wars---is my own _Finding God in a Galaxy Far Far Away_. Both books are definitely worthwhile reads 
From the christian stand point, it just reinforces everything you read about and hear about from principle christian literature. From the star wars mythology stand point, this book falls well short of explaining the hypocrisy of Christianity and "The Force". it is impossible to have a "Lord of the Force" because no one is capable of such omnipotence. The folk-lore associated with the Star Wars universe warns of such concentrated power. In fact, if a "Lord" were to exist, HE (because Staub makes no mention of a female character) would probably be evil and practioner of the dark side. Such power and knowledge can only be achieved by domination and aggression. First; Anakin Skywalker, the supposed Massiah or "Chosen One" is a prime example of Staub's flawed argument. Magically conceived, Anakin is equally as flawed as any other human being. He ultimately commits the same flaws and the same sins any other human being would commit. Yet, Anakin gains redemption through the love of a son, and the strength of a spirit-- not the forgivness of a God or a Lord. Second, there isnt a clear black and white that determines good and evil. A lot of gray exists in the world of Star Wars, and there are many complexities that reflect out own world-- complexities a Jedi Christian would characterize as evil and thus irrelevant. Staub doesn't address these complexities. In fact, the dogmatic beliefs of Christianity are the same dogmatic beliefs that ultimately destroy the jedi order by the end of Episode III and destroy the Emperor in Episode VI. Finally, i do credit Staub with finding the commonalities between God's good works and the Jedi Order. But values like compassion, humility, and love for one another are values shared by nearly all world religions, NOT JUST CHRISTIANITY. EVERYTHING described by Staub can be found in other religions, NOT JUST CHRISTIANITY. If you're a star wars fans looking for religious guidance, i recommend "The Dharma of Star Wars"-- and maybe you'll find an ultimate truth, not in the form of a "one true Lord." 
Contrast this with "God, The Devil, and Harry Potter" and note a pattern of interpretation that points in the same direction. There is one true myth, it is encapsulated best in the Christian myth but other narratives that employ that myth manage to lead us in the right direction as well. They support it. "A myth is a story that confronts us with the big picture, something transcendent and eternal, and in so doing explains the worldview of a civilization." (p. xviii) God for George Lucas: "I think there is a God. No question. What that God is or what we know about that God, I am not sure. The one thing I know about life and about the human race is that we've always tried to construct some kind of context for the unknown. Even the cavemen thought they had it figured out. I would say that cavemen understood on a scale of about 1. Now we've made it up to 5. The only thing most people don't realize is the scale goes to 1 million." (p. 6) The book is loaded with interesting insights based on Dick Staub's reading of the Star War's movies. Great stuff 
Staub has an interesting way of interlacing biblical tradition from both the Old and New Testaments with actions and pronouncements of the principal characters. In fact, one might evn, after reading this book, conclude that the Star Wars series was nothing but a long-running morality play which parallels the major morals and ethical values of much of the civilized world. Certain to provoke thoughtful reflection 
This book is great. It is definately not just for Star Wars fans, every Christian, every one actually would do good to read this book. It is my second favorite book, behind only the Bible. It has helped me tremendously 
I have been a fan of Peter Carey forever and have read all his work. His work, however,has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book. Weird characters and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense. But for the rest of us---I am really sorry to report the book is not readable. I quit after reading about 2/3ds and for me that is unheard of. I feel like I have lost at good friend 
Peter Carey is an amazing writer, and THEFT is a charming novel about the art world. The satirical insights are very apt and often laugh-out-loud hilarious, and Carey has a wonderful way of displaying his characters' pretensions and foibles without belittling them. Somehow, when i read Carey, i am reminded of Iris Murdoch and Nathalie Sarraute, as they also set their novels in "heady" milieus of the arts and academia, and were adept at skewering pretensions without losing affection 
It's no denying Peter Carey is a brilliant writer. His flair for pin-pointing the nuances of the good old Aussie vernacular is spot-on, and his characters are always society's off-cuts, but ultimately likeable souls. Theft: A Love Story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read. But unlike his brilliant True History of the Kelly Gang, it seems that Carey wasn't sure how to end this wonderful tale, and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning 
Michael Boone, a thirty-something painter who has gone out of fashion, is desperate to have his newest work noticed and to reestablish himself as a success. Michael is also the reluctant caregiver to his mildly autistic brother Hugh, who has a disabled yet perceptive view of his frustrated brother. In THEFT: A LOVE STORY, these Boone brothers narrate a story of thwarted talent, desperate ambition, fraternal responsibility, and loutish dependence, which becomes a mystery of theft and love when they meet Marlene Leibovitz, a beautiful art authenticator who may know something about a valuable stolen painting. The question that this fascinating novel poses is: How far will Michael Boone, who is angry at the art establishment, go to achieve artistic and emotional success? Where does he draw the line? Similar to TRUE HISTORY OF THE KELLY GANG, MY LIFE AS A FAKE, and other Peter Carey novels, THEFT: A LOVE STORY is totally engrossing with wonderful poetic writing that absolutely flies along. This book is highly recommended for everyone. But lovers and inhabitants of Manhattan will get an insider's thrill as the Boone brothers lurch through New York and its art scene. Bravo Peter! 
This is a smart, funny exploration of one of the lesser-known elements of the high-stakes art world -- the right of an artist's estate to declare a work "authentic" or not. The questions of authenticity that drive the plot are also reflected in the book's narrative structure, in which the story is told through two competing voices -- one a defeated, cynical, world-weary artist and the other his slow-witted, demanding and cantakerous brother Neither is a particularly reliable narrator, but the truth that emerges from their combined account is surprisingly sweet. 
A swirling canvas of art scams, art history, and Australian attitude is just backdrop. This book is really about two brothers, Slow Bones and Butcher Bones aka Hugh and Michael Boone. One is mentally impaired (he thinks in capital letters and likes to sit on metal folding chairs and watch the traffic go by.) The other is an artist. Each, by his nature, must be different from the rest of the world. Slow Bones can't save himself in social situations or manage city thoroughfares. And Butcher, though more adept, is just as likely to tick everyone off by his insatiable needs to gratify His Art. Theft deals with the balance between these two brothers as they ride the seesaw of great art thefts, beautiful women and the international art market. I found it charming and amusing. It was the first book I picked out for my book group ahead of time, showing up for the meeting with six copies tucked under my arm. I have to confess, though, that it wasn't so totally beloved by all. Ah, well. 
After reading a less than fully positive review by Updike in the New Yorker, I thought is was time for a first encounter with Carey's work. I am afraid I have to disagree with the old boy. Theft is a masterpiece. In many respects "Theft" is an update/extension of Gaddis' "The Recognitions". Again authenticity and reality get analyzed and satirized with virtuosic abandon. Yet, Carey adds a femme fatale and a helpless brother to the mix and takes Gaddis's masterful groundwork to the next level. The current art world is a parallel Universe of such a self-referential absurdity that any outside attempt to satirize it seems futile. Faithfully reading the aforementioned weekly and Jed Perl's pieces in the National Review you cannot help but conclude that we have reached a point at which the artist has in many respects become the least important player in the game. Critics and sellers/auctinoneers is what the current game is all about. As in "the Recognitions" authentication and forgery are important elements of this novel's plot line. However, the book fully delivers on the author's characterization as a love story. That love is on the one hand highly conditional, when it comes to Marlene, the con artist sans pareil, and "innate/genetic", as far as the relationship between Bones and his dependent brother Hugh is concerned. What ensues is a carefully plotted two-part-invention in which Bones and Hugh's voices alternate. Authenticity and reality may be important to the aussie brothers; much less so to their entourage. Fame and recognition seem to be the least meaningful aspects. While the carefully constructed plot justifies the price of admission many times over, Carey's writing style is even more impressive. In a warm, masculine expressionist style the brothers get portrayed in Halsian brushstrokes. To me the depictions of the genesis of the authentic "I the speaker" and the fake Leibovitz were truly impressive. Characterization of other players and their surroundings were equally great. The book ends in style: fame as a painter may be nice; mowing lawns with your brother is priceless. 
First rate story - I highly recommend this book 
When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
Daniel C Dennett is a very confrontational philosopher, much like Peter Singer; and like Singer, he is a strong atheist. Dennett will brook nowhere for what he regards is muddled thinking about anything which hides the true nature of things, and for Dennett, natural science and the idea of evolution are the true nature of things. Dennett is not so crude a reductionist he blandly regurgitates the writings of scientists. As a professional Philosopher, he is deeply aware of the overall tradition of Western philosophy, especially modern philosophy (he is one of the leading experts in the field of cognitive science and philosophy of mind). He feels that Darwin's discovery of biological evolution does not just revolutionise biology, it changes everything. Indeed he remarked in a documentary on evolution that evolution is a more important discovery than either the heliocentric motion of the Earth around the Sun, and the discovery of universal gravitation by Newton. At the heart of this revolution is the new picture of nature as neither the creation of God or as a teleological mechanism leading somewhere, but as essentially an endless process of change and flux ruled by chance and natural laws. Over time these two things blindly produce the 'apparent' design of living creatures by the well understood mechanisms of evolution, with no need for any designer in the process. For Dennett, this vindicates David Hume's essential arguments against the existence of God, which attempted to demonstrate that the existence of a supernatural being could not be inferred from the perfection of creatures or from the structure of the cosmos. Dennett accepts there is a 'God', but not the being of monotheistic religion but rather just nature or the universe, in the sense close to Spinoza believed it to be. Dennett believes evolution opens up a wonderful and beautiful vista of endless change and creativity in which nature simply makes itself out of very simple parts (atoms and molecules) and explains coherently and in a perfectly naturalistic way the beauty and order of nature. In this sense Dennett is well at home with the materialistic tradition in Western philosophy, pioneered by thinkers such as Thales and later by Democritus and Epicurus. The interesting thing is that the mechanistic world picture changes over time, and the speculations of the ancient atomists seem well off the mark today. Who knows what science will discover in 2000 years time, about the universe and the things in it? I prefer to see science as an endless quest, and in my view evolution is not the final say or answer to life's questions. While I believe religion plays a valid part of the endless quest for wisdom about the nature of things, I do not feel it is right or necessary to dismiss evolution out of hand because one has a religious view of the world, nor is it necessary to reject a religious view of the world if one accepts evolution (as Dennet and Dawkins vigorously do in other books). The primary strength of this work is Dennett's excellent research and understanding of evolutionary biology and related disciplines like sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, while the primary weakness is when his confidence in the theory becomes rigidly dogmatic and in his rather ignorant dismissal of religion in general as a useless attempt by myth-mongers to explain what science now explains. Some of the things Dennett argued for are now a bit dated as science has moved forwards, but this book is essential reading for anyone curious about the philosophical implications of this scientific theory which is having important influences on how we understand human nature and being, ethical questions, psychology and theories of the mind, and our place in the universe 
"Darwin's Dangerous Idea" by Daniel C. Dennett is a fantastic book but definitely not for the faint of heart. The book is almost 600 pages long and written in a style that requires college-level analysis to understand. My review can hardly do it justice but hopefully it might encourage you to buy it or at least to check it out of the library for a couple of weeks of interesting reading. Dennett, a foremost philosopher of our time and professor of Cognitive Studies at Tufts University in Massachusetts, says, "Charles Darwin's fundamental idea [expressed in "Origin of the Species" in 1859] has inspired intense reactions ranging from ferocious condemnation to ecstatic allegiance, sometimes tantamount to religious zeal.... Almost no one is indifferent to Darwin, and no one should be.... Darwin's dangerous idea cuts much deeper into the fabric of our most fundamental beliefs than many of its sophisticated apologists have yet admitted, even to themselves." He goes on further to state, "The fundamental core of contemporary Darwinism...is now beyond dispute among scientists. It demonstrates its power every day, contributing crucially to the explanation of planet-sized facts of geology... down to the latest microscopic facts of genetic engineering. It unifies all of biology and the history of our planet into a single grand story." There were so many good quotes that I wanted to underline or highlight most of the book. Dennett takes the time to carefully explain what Darwin's theory is and what it is not. He chastises those who have tried to "defend" the theory by packaging it in more palatable form and creating a new, non-defensible theory when the original was just fine. In fact, Dennett believes that all the attacks on Darwin's theory has simply made it hardier, more robust. In the process of explaining Darwinism, Dennett describes how it covers so many more areas than just biology. Language, culture, "memes", and even mathematics are explained through natural selection as well. What we're left with is a richer appreciation for nature and the "tree of life" than we might have had with the mythical explanations that have come to us through religion. Religion is treated respectfully by Dennett. However, he classes religion with wild and dangerous animals. Kept in a zoo cage or on a preserve, the lion should be allowed to live so that future generations can appreciate the animal. But we cannot tolerate saving the animal in his natural habitat "at any cost" which may entail the death of humans or loss of other, more valuable opportunities. Likewise, religion (if it behaves itself) can be valuable for study and observation. But it cannot be allowed to exist in its wild state where human rights are made secondary to dogma, where human sacrifice or murder is condoned or even encouraged. Even those who, under the guise of religion, misinform children about the truths of evolution, should be condemned as much as would someone who advocated teaching that the earth is flat. The future of our world depends on our children being taught reality as it has been discovered. Dennett ends the book by claiming that Darwinism can best be described as the Beast in the story Beauty and the Beast. While having a form that appears dangerous and frightening, Darwin's dangerous idea is really a powerful defender of the truths and values we cherish. Excellent but challenging book 
Dennett's metaphor for Darwinism is that acts like a Universal Acid upon everything it touches--and that means literally everything. It eats into the foundations of the hard sciences, the various and rather less solid underpinnings of the social sciences, the sometimes ridiculous and sometimes incisive branches of psychology, and the claims made as to any potential (though often simply vaporous and intentionally obscure) philosophical or theological `truths' in the round. There is nothing that it does not take a substantial bite from, and that fact cannot be avoided unless you merely opt for silly, ignorant avoidance, i.e., you either refute or run for cover! Bravo Dennett, then, as somebody needed to say this as loudly as possible. ALL the work we have done to understand ourselves and our origins needs to be refigured in the light of Darwin, and thankfully Dennett is both brave enough and smart enough to take the heat and rebound the criticism from numerous sources. Anyway, here are the facts as offered: We evolved via an unguided process which, while merely running dumb, non-conscious algorithms, didn't care in the slightest that it would produce us. Most of our evolutionary history is bacterial. Nothing much happened for billions of years and then multi-cellular life literally stumbled onto a process by which it could reproduce itself more effectively. You then find functional fit all the way up and all the way down. A goal was never on the agenda. There is no teleological drive in the cosmos - not one single hint of it. So, bang goes Intelligent Design and bang goes Creation Science. Rather than a God of the Gaps there are rather very few gaps (which are, in any case, closing all the time) and no God needed for the process. In place of that we have only brute facts and a `designer' that is no more conscious of its effort towards any perceived result than a coin-toss tournament is conscious of its overall activity. Life is a chemical process which doesn't care about us at all. As Dawkin's so aptly stated, blind fortuitous luck, suffering and unremitting process are exactly what we should expect from a cosmos of the kind we inhabit--and that is exactly what we find when we survey our existence with an informed eye, stripped of idealism, religion and dull-witted superstition. Our consciousness is a product (certainly not a cause - please check the evidence, not the foo-foo, highly selective and pre-scientific rubbish touted by people like Ken Wilber or any other religious Advaita/Buddhist/Hindu/Christian or otherwise Mystical salesperson) of the above stated process. We are not special in any religious sense, our children are not special in any religious sense, and any awareness we have of life in general or of our own existence will terminate at the point of our death as it depends on our biology. Following Dennett and ALL the neuroscience I can think of, this is true from top to bottom. The brain is the mind and the brain is a product of evolution - end of story. Read James Austin to see how spiritual experience can be related to nothing more than a function of the brain, or read Pascal Boyer to see how religions generally are the products of Darwinian evolution. Also, Daniel Dennett has written a superb cutting-edge book--although overtly polite and politically tactful in addressing the ignorant religious US right--which carefully refutes religion entitled Breaking The Spell. In that you will find a number of collated arguments which shatter religious nonsense and call it to account. Finally, life has no ultimate meaning but only the provisional, varied meanings (which are nonetheless important) that we give to it. We live, we die and nobody is out there (or in there) recording the event. As Martin Rees has it, we live in a Cosmic Habitat which has surrounded us and formed us, and that is why we can relate the structure of the world to our lived experience 1-to-1. There is nothing spooky about that so we can either paddle in an artificially prolonged mystery, or notice the overt contrary evidence. The choice is ours and hopefully it is just our own time, while not our children's, that we are wasting coming to a solid conclusion. Anyway, 10 out of 5 points to Dennett, while to any religious reader I suggest that they should get a life like I did! ;-) The perspective from real evidence is truly magnificent and completely awe-inspiring, at least compared to the childish myths that I grew up with and managed to dump before I turned 20. As Dennett asks, if God made the world then who made God? Supergod? And if then a Superdupergod made Supergod then who made him, and onwards, into the ridiculous. Get beyond it, guys, and find out out how you got here! 
This is an amazing book which should be of interest to all those in the general public who are interested in science and the question "where did we come from" 
All I can say is that after reading this book, I had to read all of Daniel's other books. Very well written book and it makes you realize that no matter how well you know evolution, there are some clever implications of evolutionary algorithm that you may not have considered in the past. 
There have been many comments on this book in the ten years since it was first published. I think what Carl Sagan said about the book is perhaps the most accurate: "a breath of fresh air". Contrary to many other people I thought the book by Dennett was easy to read, very well written, very straightforward, and not some sort of heavy philosophical discussion. He has lots of examples and many references to real science. It even contains pictures and many schematics. The basic point of the book is that despite any rumour or suggestions to the contrary, scientific, social, religious, or otherwise, the basic tenants of Darwin's original ideas for the evolution of the species remains sound, and it is the only viable theory of evolution. If anything, it has solidified its standing as a durable and accurate theory of evolution. Darwin's theory as we understand it should start with a definition, and here I quote a definition: " The process in nature by which, according to Darwin's theory of evolution, only the organisms best adapted to their environment tend to survive and transmit their genetic characteristics in increasing numbers to succeeding generations while those less adapted tend to be eliminated." Dennett points out in his discussions that many non-evolution scientists, that is, those in other fields of research, do not really understand this simple idea. They still seem unwilling to accept the theory, although adaptive change has been proven in the scientific literature through extensive DNA and protein studies - see for example a more recent article 7 years after the Dennett book: February 28, 2002, Nature, authors Nick Smith and Dr Adam Eyre-Walker. They measure (quantitatively) the adaptive changes. There are a number of sub-themes here and one being Gould's theories of evolution. Gould was famous and in the public eye, but back behind the scenes in the evolution world among his peers - according to Dennett - it seems that the situation was a lot more turbulent and controversial for Gould. Dennett describes Gould's "punctuated equilibrium" theory, a sort of stop start idea of steps in evolution that was supposed to overturn Darwin. Dennett thinks that the elimination of small Darwin adaptive steps was a confused and half baked idea (my paraphrase). This of course contains much irony since Gould himself wrote Wonderful Life based on the errors of Walcott and the Burgess Shale. As pointed out by Dennett elsewhere, Dennett explained to Gould that he was writing the book and was commenting on the flaws in Gould's theory. He met with Gould and received all his publications from Gould. At first Gould was helpful, but when Dennett found the inconsistencies among them, Gould went silent in their communications for almost a year, and refused to answer questions pertaining to Dennett's questions. The problem is that Gould had flip-flopped and back-tracked over the years until Gould's sudden non-linear jumps, followed by periods of little genetic change, were in fact toned down to just "speed changes" in Darwin's theory of small adaptive steps. It was no longer a revolution in evolution by Gould. This Dennett book is far ranging and covers many topics in genetics and evolution. It is 18 chapters long and covers the subjects in a chatty style. The book is not a quick read and would take about a week to read, on and off 3 or 4 hours per day. I read about a quarter in my first read and got excited when I got to pages 156 through 163. Here starting on page 156 he describes how the first molecules or structures of life were formed. He tells us about a possibly of a replicating parasitic macromolecule, or a type of partial or pre-virus. It is likely, or at least possible, that first life was based on fragments of proteins and RNA being attracted to silica surfaces or similar. It is all very interesting, especially the idea that catalysts might have increased the mathematical probabilities of interaction to produce life, and that it is based on just common inorganic molecules found in the silica rich clays of earth's streams and lakes. He has numerous other topics such as the tree of life, ideas about the species, Mendel, "the computer that learned to play checkers", so on and so forth. I would like thank fellow reviewer Stephen A. Haines ("bigbunyip" - or see my profile page and go to Amazon friends) for bringing this book to my attention. I highly recommend this exceptional book. Here are some other sophisticated science books for the general reader: Genome (1999) by Matt Ridley, The Fabric of The Cosmos (2004) a physics book by Briane Greene, and Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth (2003) by Andrew H. Knoll, and for a light treatment of genetics and society read: The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins (1989 version updated from 1976), or the original book: The Origin of The Species, Charles Darwin, Modern Library (original 1859, reprinted 1993) 
Darwin's idea is very very simple; it goes like this. 1-Organisms pass their characteristics on to their descendants, which are mostly but not completely identical to their parent organisms. 2-Organisms breed more descendants than can possibly survive. 3-Descendants with beneficial variations have a better chance of surviving and reproducing, however slight, than those with non-beneficial variations. 4-These slightly modified descendants are themselves organisms, so repeat from step 1. (There is no stopping condition.) That's it. That's all there is to Natural Selection: a simple four step loop; a mindless algorithm that displays no intent, no design, no purpose, no goal, no deeper meaning. This simple algorithm has been running on Earth for four billion years to produce every living thing, and everything made by every living thing, from the oxygen atmosphere generated by plants to the skyscrapers and music created by man. Dennett writes that it is the algoritm's complete mindlessness that makes Darwin's idea so dangerous. Dennett devotes the major portion of his book to aggressively arguing the above. He reviews how the algorithm could have "primed life's pump" eons ago and spends some time on describing evolution and biology. He argues that biology is engineering and thus reducible to algorithms. He also explains how simple algorithms can lead to computers that play brilliant chess and here he makes an important distinction: brilliant chess doesn't have to be perfect chess. There is in fact an algorithm to play chess perfectly: examine all possible moves and discard all moves that do not lead to a win. The problem is that the number of possible moves is Vast, and the number of good moves is Vanishingly Small; there isn't enough time in the universe to use this algorithm. Therefore, software designers have developed imperfect but powerful (i.e. heuristic) algorithms that play merely excellent chess. Dennett uses this nuance to refute Godel's and Penrose's objections to Mind as being something "special", something more than the result of a Darwinian process. Having argued that mind can evolve through a Darwinian process, he goes one step further: ethics can too. Darwin's world is amoral, without good or evil. We have invented the concepts of good and evil and Dennett ends with this. He reassures us that while a mindless, godless, amoral Darwinian process is at the root of everything, we can embrace morality, ethics, and beauty. To quote Dennett, "the world is sacred". Vincent Poirier, Toky 
In the early 90's, Dennett taught a seminar on Darwin Philosophy - most of that college course is in this book. With this 500-plus page persuasive treatise, Dennett examines every corner of evolutionary theory. Some aspects of evolutionary theory are established beyond any reasonable scientific doubt - other fine points are argued within scientific circles. Within this book all of the above are discussed in detail and Dennett takes on all arguments. In every case, Dennett leads us to conclude that, in biology, nothing makes sense outside the theory of evolution. New discoveries may lead to shifts in the basic theory, but the hope that it will be "refuted" by some earthshaking breakthrough is about as likely as the hope that we will return to the idea that the sun revolves around the earth. DDI is a huge compilation of ideas. Although published in 1995, it is probably still the most current and most quoted popular source on evolution today. It is divided into three large parts, the last part being devoted to philosophy of evolutionary science. If I had a criticism, it would be that the diversity of its chapters is so vast that not all chapters will appeal to everyone. The philosophy section will be the favorite of some, yet others will not see its value. I would recommend picking and choosing your subject matter out of the excellent table of contents, and taking your time with this book. With that in mind, prepare for a thoughtful and philosophical journey, and be ready to abandon your "skyhooks." Darwin's Dangerous Idea when applied liberally, throws acid on beloved traditions, but in the end, it may be just what we need to preserve and explain basic values we cherish. In Dennett's words, "This book, then, is for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it. Others are advised to close the book now and tiptoe away." 
David Barrett and Todd Johnson at the World Evangelization Research Center in Richmond, Virginia have just completed the 2nd edition of the World Christian Encyclopedia. This 2,400 page, 2-volume reference set tells the status of Christianity and of evangelization in great detail for every country, people, language, city, and province in the world -- together with a trove of other information, statistics, and resources for the decision-makers in the world of missions. A companion CD, the World Christian Database, is planned to follow. This particular work, when complete, will help facilitate the analysis now missing from this monumental enterprise, a truly impressive work of religious, especially Christian, demographics. There is really nothing like it in terms of sheer raw data 
Almost 20 years ago the initial edition of the WCE was a great advanbce in religious information and statistics. The second edition (now 2 volumes) reflects much of the change in the religious scene in the last 2 decades and that alone is worthwhile. What is interesting is that the projections made 20years ago for the year 2000 have often turned out to be 'spot on' and this adds to the value of the work. I commend this latest effort w/o reservation and look forward to updates more frequently. Religion is one of the things that everyone shares-we all have it. This book should be in every library-esp. religious ones.As a priest who follows and studies and interacts with this world I can recommend it most heartily 
Professor Putnam has written a superb review of the decliine of community in the United States through the end of the 20th Century. He points to television, urban and suburban sprawl, generational change and changing work habits as being the major causes of the collapse of the American community. He provides massive amounts of survey and study data to prove what most of already know: Americans don't get together with their friends, neighbors, fellow citizens or even their families as much as they used to. The presentation of the data is the best part of the book. Putnam's explanations are often insightful and though he also frequently turns a blind eye to the causes of the destruction of the American community, namely several decades of relentless left-wing attacks on American society. The church as a staple of the community? Destroyed by left-wing secularism. The family as a core unit of community? Destroyed in some places by left-wing policies that made family formation not only impossible (i.e., the ban on female headed welfare households admiting to a male presence)and by left-wing agitation for "sexual freedom." Interestingly, Putnam provides evidence of the proof of the foregoing and more in some of his own data. The places where "social capital" and community remain intact are the so-called Red States, the very communities Putnam's academic colleagues at Harvard deride day after day. Putnam's cure for the decline of American community, not surprisingly, requires lots of government intervention. Putnam's book is fascinating if you disagree with his reasoning. What would be more interesting is the same data reviewed by conservatives. There is no doubt that they would agree that the American community has declined, but the reasons given for it and the ways to its revival would be markedly different. Jerr 
I can't add anything that isn't already on the backcover. Putnam has detailed research showing the loss of social capital in the U.S. and insightful analysis of the implications as well as possible solutions. It's a highly readable book for academics and non-academics alike. A vital read that will be relevant for years to come 
This book definitely gets a little bogged down in statistics at points. A couple of the chapters could have been easily trimmed down by a couple paragraphs and tables (and boy are there a lot of tables). However, I still think this book is an important contribution to the discussion of american community versus radical individualism. The other nice thing I would like to point out is the multiple positive reviews from across the political spectrum. It's not all the time that a book gets approval from the nation, the national review and the economist. It's as nonpolitical as it can get, despite the politically sensitive material 
Way too full of statistics and other sociological data for my tastes but when it points in the direction I agree with, like any old ideologue it's hard not to plug it. The book is about how community activity and activism has fallen dramatically in the past fifty years, beginning with the baby boomers generation, and how my generation has only continued the slide. The title comes from the decline in bowling leagues to bowling merely when time allows. A lot of what Putnam blames is TV (curse you infernal tube, err screen) in sucking up time with only passive reaction. How pretty much every other activity requires an active response and that this has caused people to stop caring. He also discusses how sports have become far more spectator than participatory, allowing for more tv watching. The difficulty he runs into is that, though published in 2000, the internet was not adequetely advanced and so is not adequetely covered. For it is a physically passive activity sans porn that can be menatally rigorous or passive due to the desires of the participent. But it also has engaged more people in a new pseudo conversation than ever existed before. A conversation without bounds of physical place or honest presence which allows for great deception but also great forthrightness. It is absolutely packed with statistics so for those inclined to that method of persuation it could be quite successful, but merely on the sheer breadth of topics discussed it is worth the read 
Robert Putnam's book bemoans the declne in "civic participation" among Americans since its heyday in the 50's and 60's. Although few would argue that bridge clubs aren't what they used to be, who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962? This underlines the basic problem with this book: it focuses too much on what constituted "communities" and "activities" in the past, without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today. While I agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index, and participation in traditional FORMAL organizations has declined, I would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen. For example, while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system, college students today volunteer more that any generation before them. In addition, while participation in mainline Protestant churches has stedily declined, engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically. While I personally feel that the sterile suburban, drive-everywhere-in-my-SUV existance is soul crushing, and the popularity of reality TV may be a sign of the apocolypse, I also don't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week, while dad worked 9-5, returned home to supper, and went to the Men's Club on Tuesdays at 8. And while Putnam's basic premise may resonate with many, its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument 
Putnam has hit the nail right on the head. Public policy makers world-wide have taken note. His constructs of 'bonding'and 'bridging' to the broader community through social networks to add value, or social capital, to society have gained wide currency. His research is exhaustive, more than necessary perhaps to make the case for disengagement of citizens. But, he has confirmed empirically what so many know intuitively to be true, hence the appeal of his findings. His recent work with John Helliwell published in the 2004 proceedings of the Royal Society on social capital and well-being, reported in the media as the science of happiness and the object in my own work on positive networking, advances the discipline even further. Positive networking works, it takes leadership and, when done right, adds social capital to the community. Putnam's work is compelling. His arguements are powerful...highly recommended 
I'm resident in Germany, I like the Workman Cat Calendar very much and all my friends like it too. I think, the Calendar could not be better, so each year I order the Calendar as a Christmas gift for me and my friends! Purchase and fast delivering is without any problems, absolutely perfect. Many thanks to Workman Publ. and Amazon! Greetings from Germany, Ingeborg Vetter 
Workman Publishing is famous for the "bad cat" calendars and the 365 Kittens a Year Calendar. If you love cats it is more than likely you have either seen these items or own them and buy them every year. You can even enter the Cat Calendar Contest and possibly see your very own cats in the calendar the following year. What a fun and inventive idea! This creates some of the best cat pictures you will find because of the wide variety of pictures to choose from each year. In the 2007 Page-A-Day Calendar each picture is accompanied by lore, health and care tips, trivia, personal information about the cat featured or breed information. Each picure is just priceless and you can't imagine how anyone was able to get six cats to sit together for a picture. This alone is a miracle and more than likely one of the reasons this picture won second place. Some of the picture make you smile, some make you laugh and all of them are filled with feline perfection. My favorite picture is of two kittens watching Cat TV on a Dell Screen. There is information on where you can find the DVDs to entertain your cats for hours at a time. They really will watch TV if the right DVD is played. My kitten Meesa watches Amazon IMAX the most for some reason. ASIN: B00022PYZ2. The Jaguar and the river scenes really capture her attention. It was pretty funny! ~The Rebecca Review 
This book is high entertaining and intellectually slightly challenging. If you like satire, thinking outside the box- and subtle humor I recommend it highly. If you wondered why you had to read all those long generally depressing books in literature class, this series is your reward 
It's late. Your spouse says, "Turn off the light. It's after midnight." You mutter, "One more chapter." This is that kind of book. And it's LOL good. 
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway. The setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of "The Eyre Affair", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe's "The Raven", and it seems they want him back. This a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a "lost" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it. There's also the small matter of Thursday's pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursday's role as a "SpecOps Litratech", and that whole milieu, she's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of "Jurisfiction", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order... Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him. Phew! I've probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea. Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve. It's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he's just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place. I suppose it's all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man's Douglas Adams. The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there's absolutely no narrative tension. All the literary in jokes in the world can't save this shambling wreck, and I don't think I'll be moving on to the next book. 
LOST IN A GOOD BOOK may be a painful rite of passage for a linear thinker. Here, in author Jasper Fforde's England of 1985, people keep dodo birds as pets, a special police unit drives stakes through vampires' hearts, Tunbridge Wells has been given over to Russia in war reparations, London to Sydney travel time is 40 minutes by Gravitube through the Earth's center, air travel is by lighter-than-air airship, cheese is contraband, there's a duty on custard, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis has been recreated from recovered DNA and now provides society with its minimum-wage untermenschen, time travel is a reality, and 249 wooly mammoths in nine herds migrate back and forth across Britain. So little of this parallel universe makes sense that I at first doubted my ability to finish the book. But, intrepidly, I carried on. The heroine of the story is Thursday Next, a Literary Detective in department 27 of SpecOps, the national law enforcement megaforce. The mission of SO-27, among other things, is to validate the authenticity of recently discovered works by dead authors. The title of the book refers to the ability of certain trained adepts to physically enter book plots in real time, much as Mary Poppins and her young charges were able to pop in and out of chalk pavement pictures in the film MARY POPPINS. This talent is so rare that, here, Next is coerced by a representative by the world's monolithic business corporation, Goliath, to rescue his unsavory half-brother previously marooned by Thursday within the pages of Poe's "The Raven" in the first book of the Next series, THE EYRE AFFAIR. In return, Goliath will restore Thursday's husband Landen, who has been eradicated. And, as if that wasn't enough of a bother, Thursday must also thwart the imminent destruction of all Life on Earth by rampant strawberry flavored Dream Topping. Perhaps you can see where a linear thinker might suffer a migraine. The enjoyment of becoming lost in LOST IN A GOOD BOOK isn't related to a nail-biter plot because what plot it possesses isn't; the word "peripeteia" comes to mind. Rather, the joy comes from the expectation of reading what clever quirkiness the frisky imagination of Fforde cranks out - sort of a present-day version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Indeed, the Cheshire Cat is one of the book's characters. It's that imagination that compels me to award the novel five stars though it goes against my grain. I'm not particularly driven to read THE EYRE AFFAIR, but I have ordered the next in the series, THE WELL OF LOST PLOTS. It will undoubtedly spend time in the waiting room with the twenty-some more linear works awaiting my attention until I get the urge to lose myself in a bit of benign madness 
I was 'knocked out' by the "Eyre Affair" and very sad when I approached the end. However, I learned of the "Next" installments and immediately ordered them. "Lost in a Good Book" has been a wonderful read and I have been once again immersed in Mr Fforde's wonderful imagination and Quixotic characters. I pray he keeps his health and writes quickly. 
if you haven't begun this series by fforde YOU should. it's a great fantasy novel that has many laughs and you can really root for thurday 
These novels are worth the price of admission just to experience Fforde's imaginative powers. Plus, where else can you find such a mixture of whimsy, detective fiction and literary references 
Jasper Fforde is seriously bizarre and it shows in his incredibly creative premise for the Thursday Next series. All of these books are very well written and can stand on their own (as complete novels), but if you read the books in sequence -- Thursday Next's story becomes better and better. Each book answers questions that I did not even know to ask -- and the story becomes even more satisfying. I refused to loan the books "out of order" to friend, because I felt that she would enjoy the entire series -- not just the one title that she asked to borrow. I highly recommend the entire series -- and so far -- anything else Jasper Fforde has written. 
I was a bit annoyed by The Eyre Affair but also intriqued about the book jumping and time travel. So I read this sequel and found it to be more fun :) that I am willing to forget my bugs with the first book. The jump can happen from-to a book, between one book to another, sometimes to something that was not a book at all! Just a 3-4 lines of washing instruction could do the trick ;) While the time travel with Next's father was exhilarating. However, there are some time lapses between the actions that were not fully described/ explained because I found myself wondering why Friday was a long way from Tuesday (well, certainly has not happened in all my days)? It really needed one more day to accomplish what Next was doing, but guess what, later on, there was a dialog indicating that it has been 2 weeks. Well, what do you know. Time 'slipped'? where have the days gone by? @_@ But then, an unexpected twist happened near the end and I was very satisfied by the play that I don't really mind about the missing day(s). I admit the story still needs some polishing but the science fictional thoughts popped in it are too good to be passed by 
In this sequel to The Eyre Affair, Thursday Next must rescue Jack Schitt of Goliath Corporation from the pages of The Raven, where she left him in the previous book, or else Goliath won't bring back Thursday's husband, Landen, whom they've erased! This volume also introduces us to Jurisfiction, the counterpart of Special Ops that exists within books. This is wildly creative stuff, from a hilarious scene in which Thursday must appear on trial before the judge from Kafka's The Trial to meeting a very unhappy Jack Schitt in the pages of The Raven. Fforde keeps the clever puns and wordplay coming: at one point Thursday's father describes an alternate universe in which World War II ended in 1945 but most things are similar, including the existence of the painter Carravagggio (but that is his name is spelled more sensibly there). On the other hand, the plot of this book feels less focused than The Eyre Affair. Towards the end, we do gain some insight that ties together earlier events, but takes a while in coming. And this book very much sets us up for the sequel: on to The Well of Lost Plots 
This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes. First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it. Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business. Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book. What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered? I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this. Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule. Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings. That's it - you got it! Whew! Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
In a recent newspaper, in one day ... Enron chief pleads not guilty, Adelphia execs found guilty, no retrial in stock scandal ... and this was just the front page of the business section. On that same page, I noted the use of the phrase, "ethically amoral." Have we finally reached a point where we can construct such phrases? Corruption, moral relativism, the meaning of "is," have you had enough? If you are looking for some insights into the problem and perhaps an alternative approach, here's your book, There's No Such Thing as "Business" Ethics. Maxwell writes, "...There's only ethics." Maxwell is right, and through interesting stories and common sense he argues for the adoption of the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would like to be treated. I read this book in hopes to validate my own research for my book, Swapping Lies! I felt that perhaps my call for a return of honor to the workplace was a bit too much, too naive. I was surprised to read that I am not the only one who feels this way. Maxwell is calling for the Golden Rule! Many will consider the Golden Rule a bit nave in today's world, yet it is principle that successfully guides us in our business endeavors. A principled and focused leader is not nave. In fact they are a constant source of strength and confidence to all. Spend just an hour to read this book. It may change you and your company. 
The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good. John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday. It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us. However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book. First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything. I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love. Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well. Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track. This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products. Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed. In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored. Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better 
Excellent Book. Simply written but loaded with information. If you are tired of the ups and downs of dieting, this book is very helpful 
I found this book to be one of the most life changings books I have read todate. The author gives you a really clear path that makes you focus on your life and you as a person. The insight that I have gained about myself was really freeing. I read the book through once and then I started all over again with Chapter One. I got a journal and I have begun writing, meditating on the scriptures from the book and really learning how to connect my poor eating habits to the stressful or negative events that occur in my life. I will be using this book for the next few years. This book can really be applied to any addiction that a person may be dealing with. 
This is the last weight-loss book you will ever need! Thin Again teaches the reader how to deal with the inner causes of over-eating first. I have never read anything like it! It's not man-made psychological principles that will make permanent changes. It's the application of Scripture and the healing ministry of the Holy Spirit. Thin Again is a gentle, non-threatening, non-judgmental treatment of the problem of obesity and food-addiction. I have read volumes on these subjects, but this one changed my life, and I am encouraged for my future as a much thinner person 
Judy Wardell wrote one of the very best, and first, non-diet books for achieving desired weight loss - "Thin Within". Then she got married. I can only blame her husband for converting an imaginative, insightful writer into a Bible-beating fundamentalist who quotes scripture in every paragraph 
I used to participate in Weigh Down Workshop, which had similar guidelines for hunger and fullness, but after multiple problems I encountered with the religious teachings, I dropped the program. Then a friend told me about 'Thin Again' which was actually around BEFORE Weigh Down! What a refreshing alternative, and easy reading! Now I'm back on track with my weight and guilt-free! 
This was a wonderful book! This bridges the gap between spirituality and weight loss. There are no "formulas" or "forbidden foods". Just a lot of helpful, soulful advice 
I highly recommend this wonderful God-given book! I am a former Weigh Down Workshop coordinator, was searching for a less condemning approach, and God led me to this book! The "Hunger Scale" is easy to abide by and the spiritual approach is very inspiring, uplifting, and healing. I believe the answer most people struggling with weight control is looking for; it certainly was for me! It is written in a format that can be used personally or in a small support-type group setting 
yes, the writer seems to repeat herself a lot in the story. i almost thought there were only two characters after reading the first 100 pages. but then it grew better, and even more appealing towards the last 100 pages. it is a decent novel, and i'm glad i read it. it is not as thought-provoking as the two novels of anita shreve i read, but i certainly enjoyed the reading 
I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, "so and so was a devoted mother" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading. 
This the first of Daninell's books I read. I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen. I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident. I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot. There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds. It's also too predictable. To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman. Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off. I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching. I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans. My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book. 
The Kiss is the second book I have read by Danielle Steel so far. It was great. My first book of hers I read was The Wedding. I highly recommend that one. Both are excellent books. I love romantic books. They suit my personality beautifully. I even have considered trying to write a love story, with my own experiences. Real life is a lot better and more complex then fiction ever could be. But I do like fiction as much as I love biography or autobiography. Any genre is fine by me.  This is an inspirational book. It deals with disability and how people overcome hurdles in their path. It has some touching moments. Some moments I adore. In the hospital. And one person's strength to bring someone between life and death back to life. No matter what the resulting burdens may be, after a horrific car accident with a bus during one long and only everlasting kiss.  Two people in strained marriages. One with an invalid boy and daughter. The other in another loveless marriage and affairs. The only contact they share is moments from time to time during the year, and phone calls. That keep their lives fullfilled. Two people who love each other but cannot take the next step to make their lives better and be together. Mainly due to commitment to husbands and wives. No matter how hopeless or worthless an existence it may be with their partners. Yet slowly things are unravelled and secrets that have lay hidden for years are exposed.  I think I have made a pretty good summary of the book for people who don't know the book I read. I think it is worth reading. The story seems quite simple and it is. But like always, I am surprised how things turned out and the marvellous twists and turns the story takes. To secure Danielle's place in romantic fiction for sometime to come. I would read more of her books. They are lovely. I wanted to read 'The Kiss' because I felt it was so perfect for me. I love kissing girls. Friendly kisses more then boyfriend/girlfriend type kisses. I know it may sound strange but I think to fully understand it, and my e mails sometimes you may have to meet me. Or a least listen to my voice on tape one day. To pick up on some of the humour I like to inject into my e mails most of the time. And sometimes how I see the world and live my life. As movie-orientated as it is.  Danielle Steel is pretty light reading usually. She's the best! I don't really want to read Barbra Taylor Bradford. Although I do wish they would make a movie of 'The Wedding'. It would be so good. It would be harder to make a movie that affects people with 'The Kiss'. But since I read the book, I'd be happy to watch any resulting movies they might make. I haven't seen any Danielle Steel books adapted to movies. I'm sure they are extreamly sappy. But I can handle it I think. I don't think I will read all of her books, just the ones that look most interesting to me. 'The Wedding' was special because I have never been to a wedding before. 'The Kiss' was good because I love to kiss girls. Plus I am a pretty affectionate person. I also think quite tactile too. I'd take any opportunity to give someone a hug or show affection. I am full of compliments usually. 
Another romantic novel by Danielle Steele... this time the setting is Europe. Isabelle Forrester is stuck in a miserable marriage with a wealthy and obnoxious French man who treats her really bad. Bill Robinson is stuck in a life-less marriage to a wife who does not care about him. The two come together and over time fall madly in love. One night in England, together in a limousine, they give each other a breath-taking and long-lasting kiss. The kiss turns out to be a life-changing event for both of them... A moving story with a happy ending 
Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good. I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
A must have for anyone who writes or teaches writing or is learning writing. My 7 yr. old 2d grader loves this book but so do I as a writer and teacher. My son finds it easily understandable and it is written in such a way it is fun for him to use. As a result he is far ahead of most children his age in his writing skills. What sets this book apart from other books or grammar is not only is it superbly organized but it has numerous examples which make the principles of grammar easily understood. That is one reason is is useful for a teacher in that it provides so many examples for use in the classroom. The book begins with the theme of sentence buildng and the user learns how to build sentences. That is a valuable concept in both learning and teaching grammar. I enthusiastically recommend it 
I found several parts of this book exceptional, meaning much better than the average grammar book. The coverage of first person, second person, and third person writing in both singular and plural forms was well-done, including a later section on first, second, and third person pronouns. There are also excellent sections on object of preposition and object complement (yeah, I didn't know what that was either). The sections on pronouns are extremely complete and go on for pages--I didn't realize how many pronouns and types of pronouns there were. Verb tenses is also covered very thoroughly with many examples of present, past, future, present perfect, past perfect, and future perfect. Prepositions are covered very thoroughly, including explanations for when they're used (to tell location, direction, time, relationship, etc.) and then a list of prepositions. This book also has an excellent appendix with various unique parts. One section covers the term "IVAN CAPP" which is an acronym for remembering the order of parts of speech--Interjection, Verb, Adjective, Noun, Conjunction, Adverb, Pronoun, Preposition. One of the appendices sections has "initials, acronyms, and abbreviations", which is also helpful. The sections I've described above are often in grammar books, but not fully explained and it is even harder to find all of these in one book. My one disappointment was in the coverage of when to capitalize, which was a bit short and with few examples. For such a concise book, that's still pretty good 
This book it is a great help when I am not sure how to guide my kid...very good just followed the rules in this book 
Since my original language is German it was a great help to have this book now that my daughter is a student in an American school. Although I understand the basics of English grammar this book showed me steps on how to teach my daughter English grammar without making it too complicated. It also helped me refresh my grammar. I have also recommended this book to my daughters 1st Grade teacher as an ideal companion for any parent whose kids are starting to write stories of their own. 
I've recommended this book for people, who want to improve the writing skill. I found this book very helpful for foreign people. The book contains the basic ideas and good examples 
This book is a masterpiece that everyone, student or adult, shouild read. It clearly illustrates the fundamentals of good writing and conveys complex ideas in an understandable way. Mr. Terban has clearly written the best grammar book on the market and every classroom should have a copy. Plus, it is a very useful tool for highschool student studying for the SAT's or SAT2's in writing. I highly advise anyone who wishes to improve his or her grammar to pick up a copy

I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there. I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
I loved this story line. Nora makes it so easy to picture every tiny detail. The big Italian family, the restaurant they own, and the small town. I couldn't put this book down. Usually I have a problem with stories that keep jumping into the future, but I had absolutely no problem with this book whatsoever. Actually, being able to watch the characters develop and grow over that time period was one of the things I liked most about the book. By the end of the story I felt like I knew all the characters. 
I loved this story! I am from a large Italian family and I thorougly enjoyed the picture that was portrayed in this book. I could picture the city and the small Italian restaurant. I could also almost taste the food. I thought the plot was excellent and the characters were well painted. I wished that the person who was the arsonist was a little more difficult to guess. It was the most obvious. But, I highly recommend the book...you could almost smell the smoke!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death. I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book. Believe me, it is not one of her best. I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long. It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts. Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable. How many boyfriends of one person can be killed? The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either. I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess. 
Great story!! Excellent in fact. My beef is with the narrator and editor: As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references. However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards. For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g! It is Boo-g... Do better research!! 
The loving Italian family, smart and capable protagonist Reena Hale, compassionate and good-looking boyfriend, and sex "off the charts" in Blue Smoke will satisfy loyal Roberts fans. However, if readers are looking for the afternoon delight kind story sometimes associated with Roberts, this book is not for you. Blue Smoke is harsh. Sadistic rape, murder, and a truly evil sociopathic character may put unsuspecting readers right off. But after reading Blue Smoke, I have even more respect for Ms. Roberts as she shows her ability to work in yet another genre. Except for some minor logistical problems associated with a handgun during the story's denouement, Blue Smoke works. It shows that talented writer Nora Roberts can play with the big girls of this genre (Reichs, Gerristen, Slaughter, early Cornwell, et al). I hope Ms. Roberts keeps Reena Hale on hand for a few more adventures. Good job, NR 
Perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers. Those who detested it said it was because of the violence. Those who like it apparently liked it because it was by Nora Roberts. There are the usual Nora Roberts fixtures here: a beautiful, independent, tough heroine; R-rated sex scenes; handsome and talented lovers; flowers, etc. It has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts, but there's nothing very mysterious about it. Anyone who doesn't know who the arsonist is after the first fire hasn't paid much attention. In fact, I kept wanting to tell Reena to wake up and go get him. Perhaps the biggest departure from Ms. Roberts' previous books (for me, at least) is the rather humdrum atmosphere. Ambience is the writer's strongest suit in other works--Alaska in winter, an island off Boston, Chesapeake Bay, Ireland, Louisiana etc. Old Baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop aren't quite the same. Still, the writing is mostly good and I kept reading. A second-rate Nora Roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today 
This book was so different from the usual NR story. The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic. If you want romance, skip this. It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
I have been reading romance stories for the last three years, and just as I was getting tired of them, Nora comes with something different! It was an entertaining book to read. I particularly liked the timeline that she did following the main characters through years to develop the story line. It was also exciting to watch the two romantic heroes to "narrowly" miss each other over the years and to see them finally met. In this book, there is more dynamic plot than in some other Nora's books. If you read "Black Rose" you would know what I mean. It seems that sometimes Nora has pages and pages of the pretty much the same "stuff" and it feels like she is just trying to fill the pages to get the book to the publisher. Not in this one. Sure, there are some repetitions, such as you get to read about the family being established in the community, being close, loud and helpful to each other. But it does not get to the point that you see the same sentences over and over again. And in my experience, some of her books do get that. I'm glad this book was published in summer, because it made for a perfect book to read on vacation. And once again, she did not dissapoint with a slightly different style than her other books. Well done 
If you like books on influence that have a strong academic foundation and plenty of real world examples, you'll like this one. And I loved reading it. Just before starting to write this review, I saw something that illustrates how each of us often sees certain things differently. Another reviewer believed the book's example of a car dealer's sales process lacks the details a reader needs to design a sales process. That example is precisely the one I'd decided to mention to you. Levine uses ten pages to detail this nine-step process. It's a terrific, practical example of getting the customer to make a series of small commitments that greatly increase the likelihood of a sale. You'll get enough info about each step and the overall process to adapt to your sales system to the extent you want. Most of us will choose to borrow parts of this and other processes you read about. One reason is that this particular process included unsavory steps. Sure, it will take some work and thinking on your part to improve your sales process. That's part of customizing sales systems so they work best for you. Interestingly, the book gives the real name (Mike Gasio of Fresno, CA) of the super-slick salesman...and notes that he left the auto sales business and became a teacher and counselor for at-risk young people. Mike now uses the same process of gradually increasing commitments to help these troubled youngsters make healthy changes in their lives. What a great story. And illustration of how we can effectively adapt persuasion tools to create either sleazy or healthy results. Once we have the information...the choice is ours. One of my favorite books on persuasion.  
A very intersting introduction to the psychology of persuation, how everything from car salesman, education, religion, through to cults manipulate their victims. The book has certainly made me curious to find out more about the subject and I intend to read guidebooks on how to apply these principles in everyday life. In other words this is an intro to the psychology, but not a guide on how to apply it. For example the book talks in general terms about the process that car dealerships design for persuading a customer to commit to a sale, but gives not enough detail to how to design such a sales process 
Easy to read. Lots of new material. Doesn't have a sales focus but is still a must for every salesperson. An academic who doesn't try and impress you with who he is. This is a fine book. Along with Hogan's The Psychology of Persuasion, this is one of the best. D 
This should be a book that every consumer should read. What I find very interesting was that many of the techniques employed by sales people or con artist that was used on me was discribed step by step in this book. Though I didn't fall for them back then, it was eye opening to see 'their' textbook on persuading you. Most of the information and studies in this book are quite old. But nonetheless it is still revelant today. This most fascinating part for me was how retail stores and supermarkets showcases their merchandise. Or how simply by putting a more expensive item next to the cheaper item will generate more sales on the cheaper item. Sounds simple, but it isn't, that is why companies spend so much money on marketing and research. More rational people will generally not fall for tricks illustrated in this book. But unfortunately, these tricks do work because there are enough irrational people out there that are susceptible to them. 
The first chapter is this book made me sweat. I thought I would read this book to continue my study in persuasion just to make me a better marketer, that I was in fact immune against most persuasion. Not so, says the author. His opening chapter about the illusion of invulnerability, shook me. It made me realize I'm just as easily swayed by ads and marketing as the next person. And so are you. This book is a great warning, a powerful education, and a great research tool. I'll use it to improve the marketing I create, but I'll also remember it the next time someone trys to market anything to me. Great book. Get it. Read it. Use it. - Joe Vitale, author of way too many books to list here ... 
A quick, efficient reference with the most commonly used words for students on the go 
A good quick reference book, but I will say that some words are not listed. It is focused for 2nd - 5th grade in my opinion. A handy addition for a home reference library 
I use this book in my classroom. It helps my students come up with better ways of saying and writing things. It is quicker for them to look through than a thesaurus. It helps ESL students widen their vocabulary easily. It also helps me when I work on papers while getting my Master's degree. It is a great aid 
I was a bookseller and this was one of the most eagerly sought after children's books of its time. And now that I have my own little 'Alexander' I am thrilled that it's still not only available, but doing so well. It's never too early to learn that you can have a bad day! And Alexander's bad day (comprising of no prize in his cereal, friend trouble, teacher trouble, a cavity, new sneakers in the WRONG COLOR and HE CAN'T FIND HIS YO-YO! And I won't even mention what happens in his dad's workplace!) can happen to anyone. Happy reading! Your little ones will root for Alexander (and want to know where Australia is! 
I can recite most of it from memory, I love it so! I tell people about it all the time and recommend it (along with Alexander Who Used To Be Rich Last Sunday) as a staple in every library. It's a great one to have even if you don't have kids (sometimes the little buggers show up for visits!) This book does a hilarious job of pointing out to kids that some days just stink and that you live through them anyway. The illustations have some great humor for the adults. Read it aloud to someone you love! Aura Mae, Author of Get Some Hairapy - a hairdresser's prescription for happiness 
This book is an interesting read! It helps make you see that once in a while you may have a bad day. But this gives a good example that if you're having a bad day and just think tomorrow will be a better day. Children can laugh along and enjoy this book of Alexandrer's Bad Day. Cynthia Marie Rizzo, author of "Julie and the Unicorn" and "Angela and the Princess 
I grew up with this book and today, at the age of 22, I was cheered up with just the thought of it while having my own horrible, terrible, no good, very bad day. Lets just say that this is a book that stays with you. Even in Austrailia 
My children grew up with this book and loved it. Now I've bought it for my [...] grandchild. It's a timeless, gentle, wonderful little story about how sometimes life just isn't what we want it to be 
My daughter, who is 3, just loved this book. She likes to hear about how Alexander wants to go to Australia. 
This is a book that every child should read. My son thought it was very funny, and we enjoyed it a lot 
Kids can certainly relate to all the bad things that happen to Alexander and they understand the importance of each. From getting gum in his hair to a cavity to not even getting the pair of tennis shoes he really wanted, children can commiserate with his woes from their own experiences. This book is a great reminder that even though as an adult we may think it isn't a big deal, to a kid it's a major bummer. (And of course, tomorrow is another day, so things may not be so bad afterall. 
Book #9 in the In Death Series. This is one of my favorite books in the series. In this book while Eve and Peabody are investigating the murders and organ thefts of victims, they come across a cop with an attitude. After Eve gives this officer a dressing down on record, the officer writes a complaint. WHen that officer turns up brutally murdered, Eve is asked to give up her badge while the investigation is underway. You have a very dynamic story line. While Eve's inner circle support her she still struggles with what life would be like if she can't be a cop. There are some very emotional and heartbreaking scenes. Also a very funny one when Roark gives her some ideas for alternate "jobs". An excellent book and you wont want to put it down! We meet Troy Trueheart in this book and some secondary characters really shine 
Generally, I love the "in death" series, because of Eve and Roarke. I liked this book, but I thought it was so sad when Eve was suspended from duty and had to turn her weapon and badge. But she did not give up. She is a strong woman and I love strong women, because they show real women that they can be just as strong, yet vulnerable 
In this series, each story is as interesting as the last. Eve and Roarke's relationship progressively develops but they still maintain their individuality which is quite humorous at times and never boring. What really made this story of conspiracy in the medical/political world of hotshots work for me is the supporting cast of characters - Roarke, Feeney, Peabody, McNabb, Louise, Mira, Mavis, Whitney, Tibble - they all work together to make Eve Dallas a believable and heartwarming heroine and achieve the effect of a fascinating supporting cast to the storyline. The mystery involved in this story is based on a shady character with superior surgical skills playing God with people's lives, including Eve's! I particularly found Feeney's father figure role interesting and would love to see that developed further in future storylines. Thank you, Nora, for the great stories; you never seem to run out of ideas. Keep up the great work! I am waiting for a movie (or TV series) to come out based on Eve Dallas and company. 
I was wrong. Ok, I've admitted it. I always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup of tea. While reading Conspiracy in Death I realized I couldn't have been more wrong - I love this futuristic series! A homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to Eve Dallas, since it's not a random act of violence. This man, Snooks, died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon. When Dallas digs a bit further, she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in New York City where an aged LC (licensed companion) died as the result of her liver being removed. After even more digging, Dallas discovers a case in Chicago and one abroad that were all similar. These were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying. In order for Eve Dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen. The closer she got to that answer, the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became. When she got too close to the truth, the villain had to put a stop to her investigation. The best way to get Dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department. This was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered Snook's body and Dallas. When that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on Dallas. Stripped of her badge and weapon, the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life, she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective, but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied. The main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise. There was excellent character development and as usual J.D. Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book. What makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of Eve Dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that. At times, it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot. This is definitely one to read, as all of the "In Death" series books have been. Start with the first book when reading because J.D. Robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings. Or you can start with the first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent adventure! 
This is one of my favorite series because it blends two of the genres I like most, fantasy / sci-fi and mystery. Nevertheless, I have found that in a couple of cases I feel that one of the books in the series is missing something. In this one the storyline was not particularly interesting to me, and I think that J.D. Robb did not progress as far as she could with the development of the different characters. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is summoned to a very unusual scene: a homeless man was murdered and his heart was removed with surgical precision. The killers, because the medical examiner determines it has to be more than one, used high quality tools and have to be experts in the surgical field. This creates a real problem for Eve, because it is hard to figure out a motive. Man-made organs are fully perfected and even though rich people prefer human organs, these have to be in prime condition and, needless to say, the ones from the victim weren't. Besides having to deal with finding the killers, Eve is faced with an uncooperative and outright confrontational female officer that will take part of Eve's energy away from the case and drive her close to desperation and doom. Also, when her investigation leads her to the Drake Center of Medicine, Eve realizes that she is very close to two of the members of the board: Dr. Charlotte Mira, her psychologist, and Roarke, her billionaire husband. J.D. Robb has a very special way of presenting what I interpret as her vision of a better future through some of the features of the world in which the series develops in the year 2059. For example, firearms are banned, there are licensed companions who can carry their business in privacy without getting in trouble with the law, and the Drake Center is named after the man who discovered the anticancer vaccine. As I mentioned, this is not one of the best books in the series, and it made me feel as if Robb was in some kind of schedule to release another novel for a certain date and had to go with the first idea that came to her mind. Maybe my slight disappointment is partly my fault, because I have been expecting five-star books in every time I start an Eve Dallas' mystery. This one falls a little short of the mark; but there is no way around it, those who have been following the series have to read it and hope that the next novel will get better. 
My wife got me hooked on this series and I have read it beginning with the first book, Naked In Death. Some I enjoyed more that others, however, Conspiracy in Death is the best one yet! When Eve is faced with not only a complex case of someone who is using great medical skill to kill for no apparent reason, but also with accusations of abuse from another cop, the intensity level keeps rising 
This is another chapter in the continuing story of Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband, Roarke-along with the cast of supporting characters: Feeney, Peabody, McNab, Dr. Mira, Mavis, Nadine, Summerset, et al-in the year 2059. Eve and Peabody are called to the grisly murder scene of a sidewalk sleeper. Someone had stolen the corpse's heart. When the two arrive on the scene, not only do they have to confront the body, but officer Ellen Bowers, who has it in for Eve. As Eve and Peabody begin working the murder other homeless dropouts are found dead, with various organs sliced out by a first class surgeon. But organ-legging has been obsolete for decades, because of cheaper, better, artificial replacements. So the crimes don't seem to make any sense. As Eve worries about this, Bowers weaves her web to destroy her. An internal investigation based on Bowers' complaints ends with Eve's suspension. Gone is her shield, her identity. Ms. Robb may have gone a little more scifi this time, with the discussions of future medical procedures and advanced artificial organs and all, but she's still given her readers a story that will keep them burning the midnight oil. Also, it was nice that we get to see Eve rely on the help of her husband and her friends, rather than to try and take on all her burdens herself. It made her appear more human, more identifiable 
I've read all the "In Death" books published so far and I have to say that "Conspiracy in Death" is my favorite. I cried when Dallas lost her badge (temporarily, thank goodness.) It was so heart-breaking. Can't wait for "Imitation in Death" to be published! The stories get better and better!! Yahoo JD Robb (aka Nora Roberts)! 
I bought this book after examining its beautiful pages various times at the bookstore. Last night I cooked from it for the first time. It was a lot of effort, but it did pay off. Last night I made the Deviled Chicken Thighs. My work began Sunday with four trips to different stores to assemble the various necessary ingredients. Yep, two supermarkets, the liquor store, and a bodega (I live in Jersey City, just outside Manhattan). Then the next day was the cooking. Altogether it took me about four hours for that part of the task. Honestly, halfway through I seriously considered giving up. But I persevered, the author's directions are very precise and very clear, so I just concentrated on completing each step. When I was done, my kitchen smelled wonderful (between peals of the smoke alarm set off by the cooking of chicken in oil) and I had a beautiful and delicious meal to serve. So, my thoughts are this . . . don't pick this book if you expect a quick and easy meal to toss onto the table. This is serious cooking and it takes a lot of work and dedication to get through it. But, wow, when you are done, you feel like you've climbed a mountain, and you have this wonderful meal to show for your efforts. Also--now that I have been through the entire recipe, I bet I can do it again, with much less effort and pull it off again more easily. Meaning -- I learned some things about cooking while working my way through it. Not something you can say about a lot of cookbooks. I'm going to put this book aside for a month or so, and then carefully pick a recipe and do it all again. I recommend this book heartily to someone who is interested in cooking and most of all LEARNING 
I really like this book. I has it all!!--beautiful to look at, fun to read, and very inspiring. It is set up nicely too, by season, so you will use the freshest ingredients. For me, having the menus laid out is very helpful. We will have some fabulous meals from this book 
This is a gorgeous book and the recipes are simple, quirky, thoughtful and elegant. It's perfect for someone who doesn't have hours so spend in the kitchen, but is looking for something new. It is organized around the seasons, and the emphasis is on market-fresh ingredients. Some of the recipes are preceded by a little commentary explaining where they came from and their relationship to the restaurant. Knowing that I am making a dessert Suzanne Goin has made since childhood - or a salad that was devised for a special occasion makes the process more interesting for me. I love that she included "70s mom's chocolate bundt cake." We children of the 70s can relate! This is also the kind of book that can inspire you to use a new method or riff on a recipe, even if you don't have all the ingredients pictured. The flavors are indulgent, but not over the top, and the recipes are interesting but not too complicated. That being said, I've found some of the instructions to be imperfect. Some of the techniques are a little fussy, and some directions a little vague, but if you already know how to cook and you are interested in putting some new flavors together, I think you will really enjoy this book. 
This book is by far one of the best cookbooks I have. While many of the better recipes in the book require a good deal of planning, the reward is well worth the effort! 
This book is beautiful, full of great and fantastic recipes - and most of all encouraging -- Ms. Goin tells us that we can do it - don't be intimidated...so I made the ricotta gnocchi, several of the pork and chicken dishes - outstanding! Buy this book 
This cookbook is simply devine. Suzanne is right on the tip of what American cooking should be about right now. Her food is modern without being pretentious. I love her little comments and tips before each recipe. I can't wait to try some of the recipes. 
Sunday Suppers At Lucques: Seasonal Recipes From Market To Table provides an outstanding set of recipes from a Los Angeles restaurateur whose cooking has won her accolades since 1998. Here are over a hundred of her recipes, arranged into three-course menus organized by season. Lest you worry they are geared for professionals or restaurant owners - they've been edited for home use and are divided into step-by-step preparation tips for quick and easy reproduction, and paired with color photos to encourage polished results. Be ready to use some exotic ingredients, though: Chilled Red Pepper Soup with Sumac, Basil and Lemon Yogurt and Spiced Pork Stew with Polenta, Root Vegetables and Gremolata provides plenty of flavor and require access to fennel, sumac and other spices and vegetables peculiar to more urban markets. 
I haven't had much success with cookbooks from celebrity chefs-either they're overly complicated, with pages of ingredients, or they're the 'food network' type of cookbook (where one wonders who really came up with the recipes, the author, or a team of testers)? So I purchased this cookbook primarily because the recipes themselves really intrigued me. They seemed simple, yet unique at the same time. The recipes are time consuming, definately. But once you make a dish once, you can easily streamline the directions yourself, cutting out unnecessary steps. I tend to cut back on marinating and salting time, for example, and haven't had any negative effects. Because the dishes take time, I've found I've been happiest when the end result has been unique enough to be worth the effort. The Devil's chicken thighs, for example, were delicious, and different enough from any other chicken dish I've made that I happy to have spent the time it took to make. Same goes for the halibut with roasted beets, and the torchio with cavolo nero, both of which I made on a weeknight after work. I was also impressed by the attention to detail. Every recipe is designed for a group of 6--something so small, yet I find it so frustrating when a cookbook has quantities all over the map. The directions are extremely clear and concise, and I really appreciate the notes on prepping ahead. A home cook with a decent level of experience will have no problem. And the ingredient overviews at the beginning of each chapter are a perfect introduction to the seasonal menus. A outstanding book that I love to cook from. I can't wait for the next one! 
I haven't gotten excited by a cookbook in years but Sunday Suppers was just the thing to get me back to the kitchen cooking new dishes. I love her sense of food and her unpretentious writing. Also, her focus on local foods from farmers and her simple ways to prepare them -- never too much nor too little. Thank you Suzanne, for a great book. Will have to say I am amazed at a couple of the pretentious reviews here. I mean really, start your own blog already and stick to the subject. Per favore 
This book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by Anne Frank. I read the book in high school and then recently read it after my husband and I visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. It was so interesting to read the book after having visited the real. I would almost recommend reading it before and after visiting the site 
I have just finished the Diary Of a Young Girl and i have the strong feeling that i was moved back in time, as if it was 1944. The diary is incredible, almost hard to belive that if was written by a 13 old gilr. If olny she'd had a chance to live- she would have been an amazing writer. The book is written so clearly that you are able to imagine, almost touch everytching that's inside the secret annex. you'll have a feeling that you are one of those 8 people who were living there for 2 years. I really recomend this book for those who emphatise with the holocaust victims and also for those who don't know much about the hard times the Jews had to go through. Hard to belive... 
The diary of a young girl is an inspiring story where I learned about some circumstances and events in the time of World War 2; but this story is really about the meaning of life from a teenager's point of view.She writes events and stuff that she thinks while she is hidding with her family for more than 2 years.When she says in her diary that she wants to keep living, her diary then ends, and she was found and was set to a concentration camp and died. 
A year ago, I was forced to read this book by my english teacher... At first, looking at the cover, (it was red with a picture of a girl) I had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it... After a couple of days, i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere I go... During break times, lunch, and spend 2 full hours reading it at home... Reading this diary, made me picture how Anne had her teenage life.. It was really different from mine. Nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic. No other friends to talk too... Same people she sees every single day... In a small place called the "Secret Annexe". Can you imagine that that kind of life? That you have no idea if you can eat or not, if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day... or if you can still get out of that Annex and live a normal life again... Can you imagine??? But still, they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe... For me, those people are the real heroes. They never gave up. They sacrificed and united. And best of all, their faith in God reamined strong. This book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world. This is a real story of a real world... And the fact that this happens too to so many people. Sometimes we ask, "Why do we need to repeat History?" Read this book and you'll realize that this is different, worth it and remarkable... 
This was such a well written book, that you would think an adult wrote. To know that a young lady wrote this was truly an inspiration for all those young people with writing dreams such as Anne's. Anne and her family went through such a hard two years and still remained hopeful and positive. This book really gives a great picture of what the Jewish community went through, all the unjust moves against them. It made me gain more respect for ALL religions and races. This book makes you wish that more help was sent to these people. We can never understand all the hardships The Franks went through, but we can help those going through similar persecution. 
It was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the Nazis during WWII. I highly recommend this book and I hope I can one day go see the Anne Frank museum where the family lived during this time 
Zero coupon bonds are the bonds spoken of in the book's title. Zero coupon bonds do well in falling interest rate and stable, low interest rate investing environments as we had 90% of the time from 1982 to 2004. Now is NOT the time to use this book's advice, wait until interest rates fall again (2010??). but it is true, by not owning any stocks O'Higgins outperformed the greatest -and longest- bull market in history 
Having read many books on various financial subjects, this one is on my list as one of the top 10 wastes of time. In fact I am only writting this to hopefully save you time! Warning! When the reviews are from annonymous 'a reader' be suspicious 
I agree with much of what has already been said as far as the amount of filler and the editorial glitches. And can anyone figure out the last chart -- table 11.1? These numbers make no sense and don't even correspond with the info on table 9.1. I began the book with some excitement but ended up feeling very uncertain about the method 
I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about investment products OTHER than common stocks. Instead, (in the book on tape), I got 5-10 minutes about the different types of bonds, a little detail about T-bills, and the frank admission that this book "doesn't really discuss corporate bonds". WHAT!? The whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 - for that, I must say he was prescient (Too bad I didn't read this in 1999!). More time is spent describing the basics of common stocks, and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds! Oh - and that WRONG formula for computing the price/sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version. I actually had to rewind the tape to see if I had heard correctly 
The method of BTDWB is good, but the book is VERY POOR!!! There is serious mistake in the method described. Dont forget to go to Corrections to 17 Simple Steps to Super Returns for a further reading. (You can find it in Amazon website----Editorial Reviews) But the correction is still containing mistake. Please note the Gold Price of the example in Corrections to 17 Simple Steps to Super Returns! 
Although there are some holes, they do not ruin the basic info provided. I think that in trying to keep it simple, O'higgins might have made it too simple. In the end he shows that this is a strategy that doesnt take alot of complicated research to use and that is the true beauty. It is especially relevant in todays stock market 
I really liked this book. The author gives you information the media ignore. He even tells you what the media are really like. Best of all, the information put forth in the book is right from Scripture. A must-read for all who want to know the truth 
As witnessed on his television program, Mr. Levitt was a master armchair raconteur, (he went to be with the Lord April 19), and more so when sifting through end time puzzles. "Dateline Jerusalem," therefore supplies the reader a delightful read, especially those akin to Mr. Levitt's theological leanings, though one reviewer has already noted agreeing with Zola greatly while still disagreeing with his most important conclusion, that Jesus is Ha Maschiach. Perhaps the greatest test of a work is it's staying power, and this work shall be enjoyable however long the Lord should tarry before entering the author's dateline city. Importantly, positions are firmed in regards to many of the major issues of the day including insights into his testimony, the Jews, the Muslims to name just the first few chapter headings. An essayist of the first order in an age when that rank is sadly thinning, Mr. Levitt's exit still leaves his projection of wisdom and courage yet needed for this hour. TL Farley, author, When Now Becomes Too Late  
From keen insights into media bias, to refreshing keys to Israel's proper role in world affairs, Dateline Jerusalem is packed with hard-hitting analysis plus new and startling information. What is the Palestinian agenda? Will Israel survive in today's hostile climate? Can America win the war on terror? What End Times events are just around the corner? After giving his testimony in the first chapter, Zola devotes chapters to the Jews, Muslims, Palestinians, the government, media, education, churches, End Times and, finally, questions and answers. Brilliant book - highly recommend it! 
I'm a Polytheist. And the author is a Christian who converted from Judaism. Those are both monotheistic religions (to me, they are both atheistic religions, given that there isn't any difference to me between believing in one God or zero). So why did I read this book? Because the author and I are both Zionists! And I want to see what he has to say. The first point that Levitt makes is that the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East would all do well if they were to cooperate. I agree. They would. Now, is the land Arab or Jewish? I'd advise taking note of the fact that when the Levant has been heavily populated, the majority has been Jewish. Levitt says the land was given to the Jews by God. I do not accept that. But I accept the fact that this statement is taken seriously by many Jews! And that means I can understand why Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital, and why many Jews have shown great interest in the region. Levitt continues by saying that Jews have lived in the Levant for 3500 years, well before there were any Muslims anywhere. That's true, but it still is ancient history. He also says that the archaeology of the land is Jewish (all but one Levantine city existed in times when the Jews ruled). And, most important, the Jews won their war for survival in 1967 (and in 1948, I would add). Now, what about the Muslims? Are they trying to take over America? As a descendant of Muslims, whose side would I be on if they tried it? Well, I'm not too happy about Islamic intolerance and its treatment of women. So it all comes down to whether we non-Muslims are already in a fight, or if we're the ones who are starting a fight. After 9/11, my guess is that we're already in a fight with at least some Muslims. Levitt agrees, and he gives the incident of the fight over Notre Dame University's attempt to hire Tariq Ramadan as an example. What about the Levantine Arabs? Are they a famous and ancient people, a nation from eons ago that merely wishes to have a State? Or are they simply people who are trying to attack the Middle East's Jews? I think the latter is the case, and Levitt agrees. It seems that Levitt is making quite a few good points! What does the author say about Hanan Ashrawi? Well, let's just say that he seems to agree with me about her as well. And Levitt has some useful things to say about media anti-Israeli bias. As well as some problems academia has been having in teaching about Israel. I'm not all that interested in the religious aspects of this book. However, I can't ignore the fact that many Christians have taken sides. Some favor the Muslims, even to the extent of supporting anti-Christian terror. Some favor the Jews. And the author has some ideas about which group is making more sense. I think there is plenty that can be learned from Levitt's book. Unfortunately, many of the people who might benefit from it the most are unlikely to have much interest in reading it, let alone in taking anything in it seriously. 
This is an important book for women who choose to work from home or who decide to start a home-based business. A big, big minus to working from home is the sense of isolation and lack of daily networking opportunities. It is critically important to maintain visibility, and that takes a concerted effort! Publicity must be part of the strategy for success - and it especially important for home-based businesses. I'm not talking about advertising; I'm talking about community visibility - personal publicity that lets potential customers and clients know who you are, what you do, and why they should buy from you or work with you. The women in this book are a good example of how even a small amount of the right publicity can produce a big, big payoff. Certainly all home-based operations will not hit the one million mark. But that's not a bad goal to keep in mind! (Reviewed by Marion E. Gold - author of the Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU and TOP COPS: Profiles of Women in Command 
In Millionaire Women: Success Secrets Of Sixteen Who Made It From Home, marketing professional and lecturer Jeanne Torrence Hauer draws upon her more than twenty years of experience to create a primer for financial success, enhanced with the careers of women who achieved millionaire status in the male-dominated business world. Written specifically for women who aspire to become millionaires in their own right, Millionaire Women combines brief biographies with savvy strategies and sound advice for making a business grow into a major operation. Millionaire Women is enthusiastically recommended as an upbeat, go-getter guide which is packed from cover to cover with examples and advice applicable to women seeking to make their mark in the highly competitive marketplace, be it local, regional, national, or international 
Jeanne Torrence Hauer really put together quite an inspirational book. Each of her sixteen subjects were unique in their own experiences. She presents them in such a way that I did not want to put the book down. This is a must read for anyone who is looking to change the path their life is taking or would just like to be entertained by the successes of others. This book would make a good gift 
I was really moved by this book. I felt the lose of a love in a family and the total destruction of a marriage and what "could have been" slowly slipping away from two people who had loved one another and they watched as the grew so far apart. I felt for the children who saw this tragedy take place right before their eyes. Both parents literally destroyed. What I still question is why did she ever go into the parking lot in the first place. I honestly believe he only was determined to end his own life and she stepped into the car to stop him and was hit by a bullet herself. I a waste of two young parents and two lost children. Great coverage and presented clearly. Thanks 
Most Cops are Criminals I really liked this book. There needs to be more books like this because most cops are actually outlaws. I have long said that direct action needs to be taken against corrupt cops including all options. If we don't fight back at least read more books like this one. 
Browsing the bookstore's true-crime section last month in search of a page-turner I hadn't already read, I spied an unfamiliar jacket: Paul LaRosa's TACOMA CONFIDENTIAL. The synopsis was riveting. I only hoped the reading would be half as good as the compelling details promised. It was. But an even bigger surprise unfolded as I progressed through the first chapter. LaRosa can write. Where has this guy been hiding? All throughout, I was keenly aware of his sensitivity to the overall politics involved. And you can be sure that, where the chief of police murders his wife, political intrigue seethes through every line. Yet LaRosa never milks it, or takes liberties or cheap shots where plenty of opportunities abound for same. Quite the contrary, what the author DOESN'T say, divulge or speculate but only hints at, speaks a lot louder. Understatement, I maintain, is extremely sexy in an author. Who can resist a subtext which says: you're an intelligent reader, connect the dots yourself. The problem with finishing a book at 3:00 a.m. is you can't talk about it with anyone. The best I could do was recommend Tacoma Confidential to my bookworm friends and urge them to read it - fast. I needed meaningful discourse. There's nothing so delicious as getting into the details of a book with other readers and discovering how totally different they may understand or explain them. I appreciated LaRosa's inclusion of an interesting and extremely plausible alternate theory of the murderous event toward the end of his story. It's an incredibly generous debunking of the purported nefarious motives ascribed to both of the main players. The theory not only sets the conditions for healing, it provokes an entire reinterpretation of the facts. Good stuff, Paul.  My recommendation: Read this book. It's satisfying on many levels. A good story, interesting facts, absorbing characters. Suspenseful for sure. And if good writing turns you on, well, that's an extra bonus. Therese Hercher 
The detailed research has resulted in a wonderful narrative which makes a great read. The sad story of these star crossed partners is very detailed and worth the price of the book. 
David Brame was a chief of police who committed at least one rape of a woman other than his wife--whom he raped repeatedly---and terrorized certain members of his department, mostly the women. He harassed and tormented his wife. This book could benefit from a little feminist perspective. In fact, it's not that shocking to find some cops are wife-beaters; it's a macho culture. Nor is it shocking to find a chief of police beating his wife----to whom, after all, would she report him? His own department? 
Paul LaRosa did such an extensive investigation it was as if he was there himself watching this brutal marriage and the lives and death of David Brame and his wife Chrystal. You can't put this book down for minute. So much research in the details of this horrible crime,from the family to David's Co workers to everyone around the both of them. Paul Larosa is an incredible author and can't wait to read his next book. This book is a must read 
LaRosa has done an excellent job of presenting the facts of this tragic case in concise, easy-to-read detail. I grew up in Tacoma and one of my closest childhood friends was one of the first Gig Harbor police officers on the scene. LaRosa's account of the events leading up to Crystal Brame's murder and David Brame's suicide meshed completely with what was going on behind the scenes that only the police knew about at the time. Tackling the issue of spousal abuse is never easy; it's even more difficult when one of the parties involved is in a high-profile position of power. What could have easily been a cumbersome, he-said/she-said book became a solid true crime story through LaRosa's obviously well-researched words. The area, the people and the aftermath were vividly portrayed. I highly recommend this book 
I had never heard about this case so I didn't know what to expect when I started the book. It immediately had a "you are there" ring to it because of the easy flow and the details and descriptions. It read like a novel. This is such a sad story, especially for the children. How sick does a man have to be before somebody notices and does something about it? Do these psychopathic men really hide their evil so well? I can think of Scott Peterson, of course, and Laurie Hacking's husband, as well as others -- and David Brame fits right in with them. Nobody notices the sickness in these men until it is all over and their wives are dead? It is so sad. In any case, this was a very well-written book and I am going to check to see if Paul LaRosa has written any others 
Mr. LaRosa has done a very good job of laying out the information, in a balanced manner, concerning a tragic incident that had a very convoluted and contentious history. He also rightly raises important questions that remain in the aftermath and deserve to be asked. This book is well-written and its reading moves quickly 
The Brame murder/suicide was big news in this area for a long time. I didn't really expect to learn too much new from a book. However, I did learn a lot. The author has done extensive investigation into the circumstances of the marriage, separation and relationships of this couple. The book was more balanced than I would have expected too. In general, the story has been told with all the good on the side of Crystal and all the evil on the side of David. This book told the other side too, in case the reader wants to make up his/her own mind. The theory at the end about how the shootings occurred was interesting and made sense to me. Well worth reading 
This review refers to the Penguin Classics edition of Henry Mayhew's 'London Labour and the London Poor' which is an abridged version of the original four volume version published in 1851-52. Though Henry Mayhew wrote several novels, his name is primarily remembered as the author/complier of this journalistic work 'London Labour and the London Poor.' The present selection gives the best part of the original four volume book, which captures exactly what the title says -- London labour and the poverty-stricken people living there. The selction includes some figures or statistics about the working class people, such as the estimated amount of money these workers gain every day (and meagre one), but the most interesting part is the first-hand records about the ways of life of various lines of works in London, directly taken from the people engaged in these works. The jobs (and some of them hardly deserve the name 'jobs') recorded here are, to name a few, street-sellers such as fried fish, watercresses, matches, baked potatoes, etc.; street-buyers such as old clothes or 'dust'; street-performers like 'conjurors,' musicians, or fire-eaters (with his own descriptions about how to eat fire), but the most fascinating is the records about boys (and some girls) who run away from parents, and lives in the street of London, who literally lives by begging or stealing. Many interesting facts are recorded by Mayhew (or his assistants), directly from the persons the book deals with, and the original words spoken by there labourers are preserved as much as possible. To read, or to listen to them is one of the greatest merits of the book, for the languages of the interviewees retain the peculiar speeches you find in many Dickensian characters, and in fact you will realize that Dickens didn't exaggerate when he created Sam Weller. And the London you see here is the London Charles Dickens knew. What did Jo in 'Bleak House' was sweeping in the street? Who gave that permission? What is the nature of 'the dust' you hear in 'Our Mutual Friend'? What was the regulations of the 'workhouse'? All these thing are answered in this vividly realized collections of the Victorian working class portraits. This book is still a valuable source for anyone who is interested in Victorian period, and will be. Buy one now. 
Henry Mayhew, founder of Punch magazine, wrote this four-volume sociological classic during the 1850's. If you are at all interested in the Victorian era, in British history, in London, or in urban history in general, this is a must-read. The Penguin version is abridged and is a distillation of the "best" of the multiple-volume set. This distillation is itself over 500 pages, so imagine the impact of the entire set! The utter destitution of the London poor is set out in such vivid detail than one cannot help being shocked at the conditions human beings were forced to live in in the greatest city of its time. The only fault I find with this book is Mayhew's occasional lapses into preaching. Otherwise a fine boo 
I really enjoyed this book and thought some of the theories were monumental. Maybe we are just a simulation right this moment, we do not know. Actually the vibration we are is a simulation from stillness, MAYBE? This was over all a good and interesting read, some pieces were a little scientific for the layman but struggle through, its worth the read 
Even though the book is controversial and presents ideas and theories that will appear far-fetched and unproven, it is still worth reading. 
Imagine the entire cosmos conquered by nanotech self-replicating machines? That's just one of the far-out ideas to chew on in this book. Even if the whole theory doesn't hang together, a lot of the parts are extremely interesting. Note: Readers without a background in science or engineering will find this tough going 
while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective. skip this one! 
Tipler says that he used to be an unquestioning atheist, but his work in quantum cosmology has brought him to the conclusion that there is a physically justifiable theory of how "God" and "immortality after death" might make sense. I only skimmed the book, but I have to say that, as a physicist, I was surprised to find the quality of his arguments to be a lot better than I expected. (Talk about having "proved" the existence of God is greatly overstated. It would be more accurate to say that, if certain physical conditions could be shown to hold, then the existence of something vaguely like God might be remotely plausible based on his arguments. But see the end of this review.) The compressed version of the theory is... Tipler (as I do) subscribes to the "strong Artificial Intelligence" belief that if you translated the dynamics of what goes on in our brains into another medium (e.g., a futuristic computer), in a sense it wouldn't make any difference -- our "emulated" selves would be as conscious and real as we are. He outlines a scenario under which, in a closed universe, in the final moments of the universe, there could be an infinite amount of computing that occurs. So much in fact, that all the human lives that ever occurred (or ever could have occurred) could be emulated through infinite subjective time. The computing entities that exist at the end of the universe would get there via exponentially replicating intelligent machines that we (or conceivably another intelligent race) send out into the universe. Based on game theory and economic arguments, he makes it plausible that the intelligences at the end of the universe would be highly altruistic. And then based on quantum cosmology, he argues for bidirectional causality between here and the end of the universe (I haven't digested that argument). Not exactly something most traditionally religious folks would recognize. But, as a theory of how "God" and physics could be merged, to my mind it's pretty brilliant. (Doesn't mean it's right.) Note, however, that the book was written in the early 90's. Tipler provides some experimental tests one can do to assess whether or not we're in a universe where the conditions are right to make his scenario possible. One of the most important tests -- verification that we're in a closed universe -- has already been answered (we seem to be in a defiantly open universe) in a way that implies we are NOT in a universe where Tipler's scenario could hold true. Still, very interesting reading 
Tipler says many times "as I have proved". Huh? What the f is he talking about? There is no proof in this stinking pile of filth. He's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-I'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense, but I don't think it should matter. I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense. His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time. The more books you read, the sooner you know when to stop reading, put the book down, and read a work of fiction instead, which can play with such ideas without boring you to death 
I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest. Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially "alive." 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one "super being" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the "omega point." 6) The omega point, via its "all knowledge of all things" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth. Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated. Thus we will again be "alive" as these "beings" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all. The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions. It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist. PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in the last chapter admits to being an aetheist. (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist? 
One of the top five, if not the most interesting book, I have ever read. If you are familar with any Omega point theories, this is another one, but Tipler attempts to incorporate more traditionaly Christian elements as opposed to Hegel or Spinoza-like view of reality. I am not a religious believer myself, but if you have even the slightest interest in how a traditional theology might be merged with science, this book is definitely worth your attention 
When I recieved "The Essay's of Warren Buffett...", I have to admit I was disapointed. I could gather the essays from Mr. Buffet's Annual reports myself. However, the book's organization is where the value lays. The author has spliced together associated topics from various essays in a manner that makes it appear that they were part of one to begin with. What results is an invaluable source on Mr. Buffett's thinking on a broad range of subjects and how some of his positions have evolved over time. I was truly happy that I did not disregard what I initially percieved to be a poor purchase on my part. Enjoy 
Short and sweet, this book is a collection of Warren Buffetts essays! He one of the riches and most financially savy men in the world, he might not be 100% right 100% of the time, but he is damn close! Amazing book, you will be glad you purchased it 
 These essays are collected from Berkshire's annual letter to shareholders, which are available for free on Berkshire Hathaway's website. The essays Lawrence Cunningham selected provide a good synopsis of Warren's investment philosophies and cut through to the point of some very important concepts. Both Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the clearest-minded, sharpest, to-the-point thinkers when it comes to investments and their openness in sharing their true beliefs is an unbelievable blessing for those wise enough to pay attention and study. I doubt there is any other billionaire who would share his innermost thoughts, beliefs and secrets to success in the fashion that Buffett does. OK enough praise, I could go on and on about his successes but here are a few tidbits from the book: "Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior. Neither we nor most business managers would dream of feverishly trading highly-profitable subsidiaries because a small move in the Federal Reserve's discount rate or because some Wall Street pundit had reversed his views on the market." "Obviously many companies in high-tech businesses or embryonic industries will grow much faster in percentage terms than will `The Inevitables- Coke, Gillette and his latest perchase BUD'. But I would rather certain of a good result than hopeful of a great one." "In our view, though, investment students need only two well-tought courses-How to Value a Business, and How to Think about Market Prices. Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily-understandable business who's earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher five, ten and twenty years from now." "In the final chapter of The Intelligent Investor, Ben Graham points our: `Confronted with a challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, Margin of Safety.' Forty-two years after reading that, I still think those are the right three words." "Beware of past-performance `proofs' in finance: If history books were the key to riches, the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians." "Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to `growth' and `value' styles as contrasting approaches to investment are displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication." Berkshire's purchase criteria: 1) Large purchases (at least $50 million of before tax earnings) 2) Demonstrated consistent earnings power (future projections are of little interest to us, nor are turnaround situations) 3) Businesses earning good return on equity while employing little or no debt 4) Management in place - We cant supply it 5) Simple business (if there's l;ots of technology, we won't understand it) 6) An offering price Some interesting stats on See's Chocolates which was bought in 1972 by Blue Chip Stamps- a subsidiary of Berkshire: Bought early in 1972 for $25 million and was earning about $2 million after tax.

This excellent book was hard to put down. Mr. Buffett is as innately talented a writer as he is a businessman. The book funny, entertaining and highly informative, is sure to add significantly to the knowledge of any aspiring investor. Buffett takes topics like corporate accounting malfeasance and makes you laugh at them while at the same time providing profound insight into the inner workings of the corporate enviornment. This title is definatly one you will want to own. 
By analyzing the essays Warren Buffet has written over the years, a reader can obtain a general, intuitive, though non-technical guide (for that Intelligent Investor) to Warren Buffet's investment method. Although appearing to be common-sensical in it's folksy mid-western prose, "Essays" explains in succinct and clear detail Buffet's fundamental analysis of businesses. Among these are a strict adherence to full disclosure of accounting transactions, the concept of economic goodwill, and confidence in conservative, factually confident and integrity filled management decisions. A solid, yet gap-filled introduction to Buffet's value-based investing principles 
This is a collection of valuable insights on how to determine real economic value, as opposed to accounting value, accounting gimmicks or financial nonsense. All that and some humor too. Grat book 
For all of you investors who want to invest like Warren Buffett - that is, successfully - this is what you really want to read. There are a large and growing number of books out there that will claim to make you think/act/be like Buffett; here you can actually read his thoughts. As WB has often said, go to the source material (not the analyst reports, etc.) to make your judgments, and that is true in studying Buffett as well. On top of that, Buffett is a much better writer than most of his biographers. The editor of this compilation has done a good job of organizing Buffett's writings into themes with a light hand. You get a good idea of how Warren thinks. Buffett has an amazing way of penetrating the thick coating of B.S. that covers most of what passes for investment theory nowadays. He ruthlessly applies Ockham's Razor to cut things down to their essential truths; two of the most basic are that owning stock in a company is truly owning part of a business and that the future is full of uncertainty. Obvious, right? But, when you really absorb these concepts the answers to the questions of when and why you should buy a stock become much clearer. I won't attempt to boil down any more of his thoughts - you can find plenty of that elsewhere. Suffice it to say that, although I am a Chartered Financial Analyst and have advised others regarding investments for over 20 years, when reading this book I had many "V-8 moments" - where you want to slap yourself on the forehead and say "of course!" While I first heard of WB many years ago (before he was cool), this book was my first significant exposure to his writings. He writes well, with wit and wisdom, and makes fairly complex subjects amazingly accessible to the uninitiated. I wish I had read this book much earlier, but I'm not sure if I would have been mature enough to put much of it into action anyway. One thing to keep in mind when you hear about all the easy ways to make money from following charts, or are tempted to buy the latest idea emanating from your brother-in-law - or a talking head on CNBC: what Buffett does REALLY works. To put it crudely, it isn't an accident that he is, per Forbes, the 2nd richest man in the world - out of over 6 billion people. (I haven't seen any chartists make the list yet.) If you are really a serious investor, why would you NOT want to read what he has to say? However, I can tell you why you probably won't actually put into practice most of what he says - it's no fun! It's no fun (for most) reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs. It's no fun keeping your own council and avoiding the crowd. Also, why wait, perhaps for years, for the "fat pitch" of a great company at a great price when you can get your kicks day-trading? After all, if most people were willing to wait until the odds were truly in their favor before they risked their money, lotteries would disappear and Las Vegas would be a dusty little village. Even those who acknowledge Warren's achievements and study his words will find putting his seemingly obvious concepts into action surprisingly difficult. But that is how you actually earn the money. Finally, here's a story, retold by Buffett, that illustrates the herd mentality you must overcome to succeed. I quote: Ben Graham told a story 40 years ago that illustrates why investment professionals behave as they do: An oil prospector, moving to his heavenly reward, was met by St. Peter with bad news. "You're qualified for residence", said St. Peter, "but, as you can see, the compound reserved for oil men is packed. There's no way to squeeze you in." After thinking a moment, the prospector asked if he might say just four words to the present occupants. That seemed harmless to St. Peter, so the prospector cupped his hands and yelled, "Oil discovered in hell." Immediately the gate to the compound opened and all of the oil men marched out to head for the nether regions. Impressed, St. Peter invited the prospector to move in and make himself comfortable. The prospector paused. "No," he said, "I think I'll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all." -Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Letter to Shareholders, 1985 
Buffett has a very uniquly apt understanding of many modern business practices and investment strategy along with the ability to explain these concepts in a down to earth framework. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt they didn't understand what was going on in corporate america 
This book very effectively organizes Warren Buffet's essays. Cunningham extracts selected passages of Buffet's essays from 1979 to 2000 and organizes them into chapters. This is a great summary of Buffet's essays and well worth reading. All of Buffet's letters for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders can be seen on the Berkshire Hathaway website. 
Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own. I own this book...this play because I read it while in a Humanities course in college. I went to college rather "late" in life...whatever that means...and yet I derived more from the experience than I probably would have had I gone right after High School. I am one of those people who believe that it's not college that makes a "well-rounded" indivividual, but life experience. If colleges and universities handed out degrees based on Life Experience, I'd probably have a doctorate three times over... We were given the assignment of reading this play and seeing the live production that the college I was attending just so happened to be putting on. With my primary focus being on philosphy, I embraced the Existentialism Unit that we were now focused upon. My best friend, who was/is an "atheist" was less receptive of these Existentialist ideas he considered strange and elusive. You think he, being an atheist, would have been more open to them than I who had already been bitten by the Metaphysics/Spirituality plague. Truth be told I think the only reason he says he's an atheist is because he's a cheapskate and doesn't want to shell out extra money for Christmas gifts. So we go see this play and people were getting pretty agitated. In this play everything goes round and round but never arrives at any final conclusions and I noticed how we, as a society, love our answers. We are not soothed by questions and proposistions and "what if?" scenarios. We feel the need to latch onto something because something is better than nothing. Isn't it? The Existentialists believe that the universe is random, chaotic, and ultimately meaningless and so in a sense they "give" meaning to meaninglessness. Just like an atheist believes in non-belief. You see, the human species cannot not give meaning to his/her life...we cannot not believe...we can "pretend" that life is without meaning and that we don't believe but everything that falls onto the screen of our perception, will take on the shape of our perceptions. I loved this play. I loved the merry-go-round type dialouge. Isn't this what we all do? We get a belief so engrained in our heads and we think that it is the only way to believe and so we spend a lot of time trying to convince someone who may not be as receptive to our point of view as to why it's valid. What I have learned over the years is that the only reason why a belief is valid is because we are the ones who validate it. It doesn't make us "more right" than the person who doesn't believe it, it just makes us believers of the belief. And contrary to popular opinion, the more people you have who also believe the same way you believe does not prove that it's any more valid than if only one person believed it. This play did not dissolve me into a puddle of desperation and futileness, in fact it added more meaning to my life which would probably make Samuel Beckett gag. It made me fall in love even more with this crazy life that only I can live. Nobody lives by proxy. Each of us are liberated and imprisoned by our beliefs. The best we can ever hope to be is determined by what we are willing to believe at any given time. This is why it's a good practice to sit down and journal about your beliefs from time to time and question why you still believe what you believe. You may have outgrown certain beliefs, certain ideas, certain ways of being in the world but don't be like the two "bums" in the play, don't keep postponing what it is that you eventually desire to see; see it now, live it now, be it now. If you are going to be an atheist, be the best atheist you can be. If you are going to be a Christian, be the best Christian you can be. If you are going to be an Anarchist, be the best Anarchist you can be. Just don't think that everyone is going to believe exactly as you believe and don't make others wrong simply because they may have another point of view. In the end, none of us truly know what's on the other side. Yes, we've had people with Near Death Experiences, but nobody has ever come back after being completely dead with a report, we just have reports from people who have been "mostly dead". Take life with a grain of salt and enjoy the ride. Peace Blessings. 
Waiting for Godot was dubbed a "tragicomedy" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play. The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work. However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you. Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be. Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own. What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality. Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous. Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale. Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold. A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor 
Samuel Beckett's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them. Is Godot God? Are Didi and Gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive, or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering? Waiting for Godot, in proper Modernist fashion, strips away all the layers of narrative and form and leaves nothing but the naked husk of a play, which Beckett no doubt felt revealed the human condition at its most basic. But the play's power doesn't really come from that. Rather, what makes Waiting for Godot so compelling is its wide applicability: it's a story about random oppression, brutality, and dreams deferred by harsh realities. It has been performed as an allegory of apartheid South African, the Jim Crow South, the horror of the war in Bosnia and about every other possible situation imaginable. Why? Because as Benjamin Kunkel pointed out in a piece in The New Yorker not so long ago, "[N]ot everyone has a God, but who doesn't have a Godot?" Beyond the metaphysical implications of the play, though, it's popularity stems from its near-perfection: for all the philosophical meaning people see in it, the action progresses with virtually no direct reference to it, and every line which seems to suggests some sort of grand significance has a very concrete meaning in the action. Take the infamous opening: Estragon, the first of the tramps, struggles to pull off his boot to relieve his swollen foot. Unable to get it off, he gives up and announces "Nothing to be done." Vladimir, wincingly wandering onto the stage and grasping at his crotch (precious few readers and actors for that matter seem to grasp that one of the play's running jokes is Vladimir's venereal disease, which causes him immense pain when urinating), thinks Estragon is commenting on his own ailment, and announces, "I'm beginning to come round to that conclusion myself. All my life I've put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything! And I resumed the struggle." On the one hand, the lines relate concretely to the action of the play; on the other, they have become representative of modern man's ambivalence towards a cruel and uncaring world, and such clever cynicism has linked Beckett to the French Existentialists in whose circles he moved after the Second World War. But seen merely as declamatory statements of world-weary cynicism, the lines lose all their power; Beckett's achievement comes from his ability to link such nihilistic sentiments to extremely comic moments, and it is the humor that carries the reader or the theatergoer through what would otherwise be an unbearably cynical play. Steve Martin, who played Vladimir in a famous 1982 production at the Lincoln Center in New York, put it best when he said that he sought to serve the humor of the play, because the meaning could carry itself but the humor could not. That's a lesson which, sadly, precious few theater directors seem to grasp, but which the careful reader discovers in Beckett. Definitely a must-read, but read it before seeing it, because few productions do it justice 
Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct. In short, this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language, to strip life down to a mere game of waiting. That is, in essence, what this is all about. We have two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up. They don't know why. They don't know exactly when he will be there. Still they wait, eternally, by the tree, by wherever they think he said he would show. This isn't an absurdist play, although it has been labeled as such. Absurdism, though, seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece. We oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex, that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story, but with Waiting for Godot, we have a simple theme: waiting. The two characters symbolize nothing. They are, quite simply, not waiting to be analyzed. They become, in effect, victims of Samuel Beckett's own game: they are his quotation, and he only says what needed to be said at the time, and so he wrote it, whether people would catch on or not, whether they would label it absurdism or not. If you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud, very slowly, word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion, you would probably capture the idea. If it's any indication, he wrote everything in French first--his second language--and then translated it in to English, just so it can be simple. I don't assume, of course, that this work should be cherished simply because it's an exercise in simplicity. But I submit that it should be cherished because it's a genuine, themeless--somehow--masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant, unknown thing that may or may not ever come. It is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous, but somehow, it manages to charm. It is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again, and it has no lyrics, and no meaning--as far as you know--but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity 
I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence. This work, however, is pure tripe. Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas. The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play. In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense. Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of "high art." The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms. Many critics have tried to convince us that WAITING FOR GODOT is very funny and entertaining. I remain skeptical. There are a few moments of wry humor, but not enough to make up for the emptiness of "waiting." There is literally "Nothing to be done" in this play. "Waiting" is a non-action. What's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant; there's something like an "alienation effect," or a "defamiliarization," as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful. Why is there "Nothing to be done"? Is it simply because it's all been done before? Or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning? In many ways, WAITING FOR GODOT is a reaction to the Holocaust and Hiroshima. The characters who have "something to do" in this play are Pozzo and Lucky, who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world. 
Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story. Most drama should be seen on stage, so that the performers can give their characters shape, bring in an audience, and produce a night of dramatic arts. That is not how this story seems to go; not at all, indeed. Beckett's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor. Here are two men, both obviously at the end of their ropes, but each keeps this asinine hope that "GODot" will show up. But, he never does. Extra characters, like Pozzo and Lucky, simply add to the intended confusion. As several previous reviewers have taken note--there is not action. While this idea is spurred by "The Threepenny Opera," Beckett takes postmodernism another step further. The characters' are so disillusioned the question becomes, Godot isn't coming, so did he ever care? Could Godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state. A fantastic read, and one of the best dramas ever written. This fairly short play should be read by EVERYONE. 
Many readers of 'Waiting for Godot' obsess about the identity of Godot and whether he represents God or any other almighty being. It is unlikely that Beckett was referring to God as the man for whom the characters are waiting, as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in Beckett's theatre. Although Beckett was not referring directly to God the name is not without importance. Godot is seen as a messianic being by the characters who will bring salvation for those who believed he would come. The wait for God is not represented by the play, but is used as a template. 'Waiting for Godot' is essentially a sustained metaphor for how most if not all human beings spend their whole life waiting for something that isn't coming. Beckett was not able to identify Godot because of the subjective nature of such a being. As critics have written, this play is a written ink-blot test and a failure to see any coherent meaning says more about the reader than the play. This is yet another example of Beckett's chilling insight into human nature, and his readiness to state what others are unwilling to accept 
Waiting for Godot, a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes, attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with--it is a call to action. This play is packed with nonsensical dialogue. The plot does not exsist. Yet, once we realized that Waiting for Godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense--at least in subtle ways. Much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality, but, that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century. It's enigmatic, a puzzle of words, poetry, and philosophy. I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. The play is short and does not take too much commitment. Take a quiet evening and give it a shot. What are you waiting for 
Dave Kindred has done lovers of sports and history a favor with Sound and Fury. Using two cultural giants - Mohammad Ali and Howard Cosell - he has produced a fresh and readable social history of the latter half of the Twentieth Century. Let me be clear. I love Ali. Kindred refers to him as the most influential sports figure of the last century. In my mind, he understates the case; Ali is the most influential person of the last century. Cosell, on the other hand, may have hesitated to tell you he was. He was not. Trained as a lawyer and gifted with the ability to articulate complexity, he brought a thinking man's view to radio and television sports journalism. Individually, they were interesting. Together, they were hypnotizing. They produced controversy, drama and comedy almost every time they appeared together. Dave Kindred tells the story of this alliance from a unique perspective. As a newspaper and magazine sports columnist with nearly 40 years experience, he covered Ali's early fight days as a reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal before moving on to the The Atlanta Journal- Courier and The Washington Post. He draws upon his experiences to re-create the Ali-Cosell story in ways I have never seen attempted. The result is a fascinating portrait of two outsized figures - their heroics and their demons. Drawing on personal observations, fresh reporting and interviews, Kindred writes a page-turning treatment of two lives that together changed sports, television and I would argue, the world, forever 
Sound and Fury (14 hours, 11 cds, unabridged, Blackstone Audio) is a duel biography of Howard Cosell and Mohammed Ali. Sport writer Dave Kindred knew both men, he has written a bio that transcends his knowledge of both men. His text is an honest, no hold barred , warts and all biography. When a third person (like Kindred) writes a biography, he tends to put his personal touches with his own bias, this book is NOT that.The book showed an unlikely partnership created by media hype. In the audio narrative hands of Dick Hill, this audio project seems more like a docudrama in its scope. Hill's narrative voice takes on verbal personas of Cosell and Ali, without mocking them. His talent has grown from the days at Brilliance Audio. Sound and Fury is an amazing production . . . you won't forget it audio, long after you heard it Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
David Kindred has written what amounts to a duel biography of the controversial odd couple that is Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell. The author tells us that Ali elected to not join the military because the Muslim Nation told him not to. To cross them was to literary toy with his life. The assassination of Malcolm X being used as an example. While not necessarily agreeing with Ali's decision Cosell supported Ali stating that taking his heavyweight championship away from him without any semblance of due process was completely wrong. There appears to be evidence that Cosell may have already been experiencing dementia when he came out with his second book entitled I Never Played the Game. Aware of the criticism in his book of his cronies in the TV booth for Monday Night Football Cosell was asked before publication whether he wanted to include these strong opinions. Since he always prided himself on telling it "like it is" he felt it would be hypocrisy of him not to do so now. Cosell was a devoted family man while Ali ventured into nocturnal delights. It was hard for sports fans to be neutral in regard to either of these men, but boxing was the ingredient that brought these two men together first in mutural respect and then in friendship. Incidentally, page 247 has a hilarious anecdote of Howard using his colorful vocabulary in breaking up fisticuffs involving teens in Kansas City. Whether you are a fan of either man or the part they played in sports you will find this to be an extremely enjoyable book to read. 
Howard Cosell and Muhammad Ali are American icons. One turned sports broadcasting upside down, the other energized and stylized sports in this country. Both displayed extraordinary courage and conviction. Both were one helluva lot of fun. Ali is one of my heroes and I'll never forget the day I met him and shook his hand. I never had the privilege of meeting the late Mr. Cosell but greatly admired him. Cosell in fact, was the type of personality you could both hold in high regard and poke fun at simultaneously. (That voice! That somehow lovable pretense!) Growing up in the '60's as I did, in Berkeley no less, Ali and Cosell provided diversion from the weighty issues of the day. Ali, the flamboyant and brilliant boxer, Cosell the outspoken trailblazing sports broadcaster and commentator. Yet both, like so much in that tumultuous decade stood for something. Ali risked jail by standing up to the draft and was unjustly stripped of his livelihood. He'd already embraced Islam and stood for a new kind of black athlete who, as we said back then, "did his own thing." Cosell tackled such issues as the injustices visited upon Ali and others, championing the causes of the oppressed. It would not be an overstatement to say that Cosell was the Edward R. Murrow of sports. In "Sound and Fury", sportswriter Dave Kindred tells the tale of these two who played such key roles in one another's lives. Many sportswriters, even ones who write books, are, quite frankly hacks, but others are practiced wordsmiths who know how to tell story with economy and grace. Fortunately, Kindred is most solidly in the second camp. In "Sound and Fury" Kindred has the huge advantage of having been around both his subjects at the very times they were making news. He brings this personal perspective along with a thoroughly done research job to fully illuminate the story. Much of what Kindred tells of Ali is familiar to those of us who followed his career, yet he manages to bring new material and offers some of the old from a new perspective. What I particularly enjoyed was some of the back story about Cosell, being unfamiliar with almost all of it. We follow Ali from his boyhood days in Louisville, through his boxing career, political stands, return to boxing glory and his failed attempts to thwart father time. We start with Cosell in his Brooklyn childhood, early love of sports, law career coincident with his determination (despite that nasal New York Jewish twang) to break into broadcasting. Next are his big breaks including Monday Night Football. And of course, we see where the twain met. Beautifully playing off one another in one of the best unscripted shows in TV history. For anyone interested in either Ali, Cosell or both (and if you like one you probably at least appreciate the other) "Sound and Fury" is an absolute must 
The praise given Dave Kindred's book "Sound and Fury: Two Powerful Lives, One Fateful Friendship" on its back cover doesn't even begin to do it justice. This "tri-biography" of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cosell, and the partnership between the two, is a wonderful book and a novel concept that only a few had the knowledge, connections and talent to write. Thankfully for all of us, Kindred has. Two books on Ali stand out for me -- Thomas Hauser's defining "Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times," an oral history that Kindred rightly cites as generating relevance for Ali more than 10 years after his retirement, and David Remnick's majestic "King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero," which chronicles Ali's rise in the context of the often-frightening period during which it occurred. In his acknowledgements, Kindred admits that he had wanted to do an Ali biography but was overwhelmed by all the current work, so he offered to do one on Cosell. His agent suggested a biography of both. "Great agent," is the author's comment on that suggestion. Kindred, a longtime sportswriter for The Washington Post, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and The Sporting News, among other publications, knew both men well. How well? In his introduction, he describes a scene in which he crawls into bed with a naked Ali in order to get a list of the names in the fighter's entourage, then segues to a scene at Cosell's house on Long Island in which the broadcaster emerges from his bedroom in his underwear, sans toupee, and flexes his muscles to show off to the author. Kindred has a genuine appreciation for both men, but his book is far more than an homage to their greatness. The author paints a balanced portrait of both as flawed human beings, who rose to fame together in the turbulent 1960s, both minorities who dealt with persecution and rose above it. Despite their most obvious differences -- age, race, religion, marital history, and looks -- they had a great deal in common. First, they were both driven by their own insecurity. Ali (then Cassius Clay) was driven to the Black Muslims by the sense of belonging they gave him, even as the group was undergoing a philosophical split that would result in Malcolm X's murder. His proclamations of his greatness before the cameras were driven by self-motivation as much as showmanship. Cosell was a perfectionist who feared the worst before almost every broadcast but managed to deliver every time. His selection for "Monday Night Football," the gig that cemented his celebrity, came only after a series of calls to badger creator Roone Arledge, which finally drew a return call and this hilarious ensuing exchange: Arledge: "Get over here as soon as you can. There's something I need to talk to you about." Cosell: "Ahhhh, from the desperation of your tone, I can only conclude that the bon vivant who is Roone Pinckney Arledge is beseeching me to rescue the trifle he's devised for Monday evenings. Am I not correct?" Arledge: "As always, Howard." Cosell: "And you no doubt expect me to shoulder this Stygian burden without additional compensation." Arledge: "Yes, Howard, I do." Cosell: "I accept." Yet for all their haughty speech and insecurity, both worked to get where they were. Ali fought his way out of the Jim Crow South, took out perhaps the most feared champion of all-time in Sonny Liston, took on the government over the Vietnam War, regained the heavyweight title twice more, and retired with five career losses -- three of which came in his final four fights, when his body had already begun deteriorating and he was going for the paycheck. He is one of the most beloved men in the world. Cosell put himself through law school, joined the Army during World War II, directed his own early work, jumped to television at precisely the moment it was taking off in the national consciousness, and had a sixth sense of where to be when a major story was breaking so that his was the first voice you heard when you needed information. Followers have called him one of the "three C's of television:" Carson, Cronkite and Cosell. So often Cosell's path intertwined with Ali's. A political liberal, Cosell defended Ali's right to take an anti-war stance (though Cosell was careful not to adopt the same public stance himself). He read the fighter's on-air statement announcing that he had refused to enter the service. Cosell was the first to reach the new champion upon his miraculous dispatch of Liston. He attended every Ali fight thereafter except the former champ's career-ending loss to Trevor Berbick, and shared numerous interviews along the way, probing Ali's thoughts and intentions. Their exchanges were often playful, occasionally serious, always memorable. Both fell from glory at roughly the same time. Ali's final fights were money grabs to support himself after divorces, the Black Muslims and hangers-on who had taken advantage of Ali's good nature, had drained much of the champ's bank account. He refused to train seriously and was beaten soundly by Leon Spinks, Larry Holmes and Berbick. Cosell, who helped establish "Monday Night Football" as an American tradition, left it bitter with his broadcast partners and done in by a scandal in which he had, ironically, called Washington Redskins receiver Alvin Garrett a "little monkey." The man who did as much for racial equality than anyone in sports was wrongly labelled a racist, but no one could overlook his increasingly boorish treatment of his broadcast partners and his self-serving rants directed toward the hypocrisy he now saw in sports. Heroes are the people we wish ourselves to be, at least for a while. And at their best, both Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell filled the bill. We wish to see the Ali who danced around the ring as a youth, who outran Liston, outsmarted George Foreman and outlasted Joe Frazier. We wish to see Cosell on the television describing the boxer he knew best, or uncovering the story behind Tommie Smith and John Carlos' Olympic protest, or opining on Reggie Jackson's dramatic homers or Lynn Swann's acrobatic catches. Most of all, we want to hear them. For both were masters of language. Ali's street poetry and off-kilter proclamations that somehow became reality made him more intriguing than any athlete of our lifetimes. Cosell's polysyllabic hyperbole couldn't obscure the truth or conviction from the words he spoke and brought him at least a grudging respect. We want to hear them again, at the top of their profession, perhaps together in a boxing ring or a TV studio. But Cosell has been dead nearly 11 years, and Ali is stricken by Parkinson's disease that has rendered him mute. It has taken another man with a gift for language, Dave Kindred, to restore them to us. D 
May your feet always be swift, May you have a strong foundation When the winds of changes shift. May your heart always be joyful, May your song always be sung, May you stay forever young, Forever young, forever young, May you stay forever young. Bob Dylan's song, Forever Young, serves as one of Dave Kindred's melodic themes in his wonderful book, "Sound and Fury". Sound and Fury is a biography of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cosell, and the relationship between them. Sound and Fury carries the reader along as Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay, and Howard Cosell, born Howard William Cohen, burst like stars upon the public's imagination in the 1960s and takes them through their respective heydays and then to their inevitable fading away. Kindred, a sportswriter for close to forty years, began his newspaper career at The Louisville Courier in Muhammad Ali's hometown. He covered Ali since his earliest days, his glory days. It also seems he was one of the few print reporters that Howard Cosell respected and liked. They stayed in close touch with each other until Cosell's death. But, although it is quite clear that Kindred admires and respects both men, and with feelings toward Ali that are powerfully affectionate, even loving, Sound and Fury is no hagiography. The book takes us quickly through Ali and Cosell's early days. As Kindred alternates between Ali and Cosell's struggle for success in their respective fields one can see the similarities between the two, particularly a single-minded determination to achieve their goals. Ali and Cosell came together in the public imagination after Ali's conversion to the Nation of Islam and his decision to refuse induction into the Army after being (finally) classified as draft-eligible. Ali's famous line "I ain't got nothing against them Viet Cong" made him something of a marked man. Ali was stripped of his title, denied the right to box, and convicted of draft evasion, a conviction later overturned by the Supreme Court. Cosell was one of the few to stand up Ali and it was this stand that helped make Cosell as controversial as Ali. Kindred does an excellent job covering the evolution of the symbiotic relationship between the two men. Kindred points out that Cosell was always very careful never to endorse Ali's views about religion or the war in Vietnam. Rather, Cosell always made it very clear that he argued only that Ali had a fundamental right to hold those opinions and no one had the right to deprive him of a livelihood simply because he held unpopular views. Kindred, for all his respect and admiration for both men, is quick to point out those instances in which Ali and Cosell acted badly. Ali's treatment of his original religious mentor, Malcolm X, after Malcolm was tossed from the Nation of Islam and then killed is covered as is his brutal and unfair characterization of Joe Frazier (calling him less than a man and an Uncle Tom when in fact Frazier had grown up in greater poverty and experienced more racism than Ali had). Kindred does not hesitate to take Cosell to task for his vaunted insecurity and his callous treatment of those around him, particularly print journalists whom he considered to be inferior beings. Kindred's coverage of Cosell's stormy tenure on Monday Night Football is both informative and balanced. Kindred is at his finest in describing the twilight of each man's career, Ali's descent into a Parkinson's syndrome induced shell of his former self and Cosell's withdrawal into retirement, seclusion after the death of his beloved wife Emmy, and eventual death. Kindred comes close to capturing that which cannot truly be captured: the ineffable feeling of loss that someone experiences when time has passed them by. This feeling must be particularly intense in the case of those who once were the center of worldwide (Ali) and national (Cosell) attention. That indescribable notion is set out in the second melodic theme that marks "Sound and Fury". Cosell's favorite poem, one he recited at length with or without prompting, was Keats' Ode to a Nightingale and one which Kindred cites often in his book. If Dylan's Forever Young serves as a theme for Ali and Cosell's early days, Keats' Ode serves as a mournful and extraordinarily apt coda. Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget What thou among the leaves hast never known, The weariness, the fever, and the fret Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; Dave Kindred has written a wonderful account of Ali and Cosell and their lives spent at the intersection of sports and the media. It will satisfy sports fans and non sports fans alike. It was a great read. 
This is the first book by kindred that i've read. i knew of him mostly as a columnist for the sporting news who seemed to dislike everyone and everything, especially anything new or unusual. but i have always been fascinated by both cosell and ali, and was willing to give this a shot.....thankfully. this is one of the best sports books of recent years: cosell and ali as individuals and their relationship (which in reality took place almost fully onscreen) is covered in full, but the author also shows these incredibly complex characters, warts and all, as they maneuver through their respective careers. ali was never more alive than when he was in the ring, or training for a fight: that is why he, as so many other fighters, was loath to leave the life he loved, fought for several years more than he should have, and of course paid a dear price for it. the fact that he may be the most beloved human on the plane today owes more to our society's need for heroes than anything else: ali is no longer able to cheat on his wife(s), turn his back on his friends (since his current spouse controls his schedule), or be manipulated by religious leaders and businessmen with their own terrible agendas (since he has little income, there is little need for the con artists of the world to carve out their pound of flesh). now, we can project all our own ideas on to this man who reportedly spends the bulk of his day in prayer, harmless to all. cosell, having passed away years ago, can be looked at in a much more balanced and subjective manner now than when he was alive. his combination of ego and insecurity was toxic to most who associated with him, apparently, but there can be no doubt that he deserves to be considered a groundbreaker and a risk taker. while the rest of american media villified ali for attempting to evade the draft, cosell sided with the boxer. this and other events recounted by kindred show cosell, as compared with his contemporaries at least, to be a man of courage, vision and conviction. the fact that he became a casualty to his own ego later in his career (ex: trying to become a news anchor, distancing himself from the sport that made him famous once ali left the scene, the bitter jealousy aimed at his MNF cohosts) does not reduce his greatness. a wonderful, moving work that will not make you want to nominate either cosell or ali for sainthood (far from it), but instead will provide the reader a deeper understanding of both, as well as the times they lived through 
Mr. Kindred is a wonderful storyteller in this very readable dual biography of two controversial men: Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell. Like "Beyond Glory" -2005- by David Margolick (which tells another story of a white man and a black man linked by history in the 1930's), "Sound and Fury" is a history of a later era, the chaotic 1960's, and a history of two outsiders. Mr. Margolick makes clear that their relationship was less of a friendship and more of a partnership -- the two of them never hung out socially but each saw the other as a genius in their domain who could further their respective careers. This book is a wonderful introduction to their lives for any reader who was born after the time when Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell had already come and gone, and as a reminder to those of us who were there 
For those of us who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, The Sound and Fury is a wondrous re-telling of the period through the lives of two unlikely partners, Howard Cosell and Muhammad Ali. It is not a boxing book. It is a work of social history, responsibly reported and told. Dave Kindred's superior writing and interviewing have made a book that should last for many years. The tales of Cosell's and Ali's lives, each up-from-bootstraps, and their accidental friendship, will impress even the most jaded sports fans and grownups. I could not stop reading this once I began 
Never read anything like this, much like I've never read anything like House of Leaves, much like I've never read anything like Only Revolutions. Conclusion: Mark Z. Danielewski is the best writer going today 
One of the most compelling parts of the brilliant "House of Leaves" was Appendix II, Part E -- the "Whalestoe Letters." But is it worth getting the novella, if the original book already has the "Whalestoe Letters"? Yes, frankly -- Mark Z. Danielewski did a brilliant job expanding the letters and characters in the original appendix, where a mother's devotion turns out to be the tip of the iceberg. The book compiles the letters from Pelafina H. Liï¿½vre to her son Johnny Truant. Pelafina is in the Whalestoe psychiatric clinic, although at first it isn't clear why. She sends doting, poetic, adoring letters to her young son, who is being raised by an abusive foster father. But when Pelafina stops taking her medication, her mental state deteriorates. She becomes paranoid, hallucinates, and sends bizarre nonsensical letters and limericks to Johnny (including a jumbled one that is made up almost entirely of "forgive me"). But even when the doctors manage to pull her back from the brink, Pelafina's desperation consumes her. "Letters" books are usually disasters, because the authors cannot put enough feeling and energy into the letters. Mark Z. Danielewski is definitely the exception. This one-sided correspondence is enough to inspire plenty of pity and horror -- all the worse because this sort of thing happens in real life. Danielewski plots the story almost like a mystery, dropping little hints during Pelafina's more sane moments. At first she seems normal if a bit overdevoted. But as she spirals into madness, we see just how mad she is, the things she has done before her institutionalization, and the terrible event which caused Johnny's father to have her locked up. This edition is somewhat different from the original "Whalestoe Letters," since Danielewski added in some new letters. These flesh out both Johnny and Pelafina, and give background to her mental illness. Danielewski is brilliant not only with plots, but characters as well -- Pelafina is the proof. She seems normal at first, but her chilling insanity comes out in little spurts until we find out what she did. And yet, you can't help feeling sorry for her, no matter how disturbing her manic love for Johnny is. Disturbing and bittersweet, the "Whalestoe Letters" are a good accompaniment to "House of Leaves," and a good illustration of just what a great writer Danielewski is 
I've read House of Leaves twice, and neither time I felt like I was able to get through Pelafina's letters. However, it was much easier to read all of them in The Whalestoe Letters. Perhaps because they are all included in proper sequence? The introduction is nice as well 
Many Great Writer's From Kurt Vonnegut To H.P. Lovecraft Have Taken Elements Of There Stories And Used Them Again So You Can't Criticize Danielewski For That. And Of Course It's Not Going To Be As Good As House Of Leaves. House Of Leaves Had More To It. It Is A Good Book As A Sort Of Sidestory To House OF Leaves 
Overall I thought the book was good. It starts at the basics, explaining aperature, film speed, etc. A good overview of all the different types of photography (landscape, portraits, etc) is also included. The only complaint I have is the book is a little dated. The majority of the book covers film cameras, with only a small section on digital cameras. However, I just bought my first Digital SLR and many of the features it has are just like the older film cameras the book describes. So, it was still relevant 
A few weeks ago my digital camera quit working at a very bad time. I had to break out my twenty year old 35mm film camera and use it. I was stunned at the quality that my old Yaschica had over my digital camera. So I bought this wonderful book and never looked back. It is filled with great tips that are easy to understand. Tips on how to use differant lenses, filters and film. Not to mention great flash tips that almost eliminate red eye. My wife and friends are amazed at the quality of some of the pictures that I have taken. Plus digital pictures won't last but a few years stored on disk and a negative is almost forever. So if you want your memories to last a lifetime break out the old 35mm film camera and BUY THIS BOOK!!!! 
Excellent book for beginner photographers or even for persons who would just like to take better family or vacation pictures 
This is a wonderful book for starting in photography. It's only problem is that, even in its latest edition, it treats digital as a new technology that has yet to enter mainstream. It just dates itself in several ways, such as saying that APS is also a new technology. Really the techniques it gives are wonderfull no matter what, its just the equipment guide to 'Choosing a camera" that needs to be updated 
I bought this book because I just bought a Canon G2, and wanted to learn the basics to take advantage of the features of my new camera. Prior to this book, I have no idea what aperture or depth of field mean. I finished this book in one sitting -- very easy and engaging book to read for beginners. I like how it covers many of the common scenarios, such as shooting at night, shooting at mid-day and when to use manual adjustment to accommendate difficult shots. I can say now after reading the book, I feel confident to take on the many features of my camera, and I'll definitely come back to it for reference in the coming days 
This the one book that taught me more about how to use my SLR than the camera's manual itself. The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography. I also liked the way Mr. Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter. One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter. Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field. An encompassing book, the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment. The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown. A good buy and money well spent. My only gripe is that I preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag 
Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11." Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy. What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss. The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake. The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism. After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it. Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption." If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11. See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book. If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
this book made me realize we must not forget and we need to boost our information gathering procedures. We are not isolated and we need to be aware that our world has changed forever after 9/1 
The Looming Tower is a very good book about the modern beginnings of Islamic radicalism. The book's timeline starts in 1948 with the banishment of an Egyptian to America and progresses to the childhood of Ayman Al-Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden and their transformation to Islamic fanatics. Wright presents some of the individuals pursuing Al Qaeda, including one who wanted to kill Bin Laden but was denied, and another who wanted to arrest him. I watched the interview with Lawrence Wright on Amazon.com and after reading his book was left with the opposite impression about the war with Islamic radicalism. His take was that we are creating more terrorists by fighting them while my belief that radical Muslims are motivated more by idealogy rather than as a result of our actions or any other country's was reaffirmed. It seems that they are driven by a desire to bring about worldwide Islamic domination. This book is well researched and easy to read. I enjoyed this book for the history of Al Qaeda and would recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about Islamic radicalism 
I bought this book to get a better understanding of the Al-Qaeda movement, the Muslim religion and the politics of the Middle East. Despite being a learned person in some areas, and somewhat knowledgeable in others, I must admit that I knew very little about the Middle East, its countries and history. This book was a starting place for me. It explained the birth of Al-Qaeda in brutal Arab prisons, the life of Osama Bin Laden, his growth into a rebel and then an extremist and finally to the lack of communication between the FBI and CIA which helped to lead up to the travesty of September 11, 2001. I must admit that I would have to read it again to absorb all of the details, and I might. Lawrence Wright has written an excellent well-researched and readable book, I highly recommend it 
I can not laud this book too highly. It is meticulously researched and intelligently presented. You will be astounded. Stunned, maybe. Did you know that the deadly form of the religion of peace got its start in Boulder, CO? Can you imagine that the people who were smart enough to bring down the World Trade Center were such superstitious morons that they thought a glucose IV bottle was attracting Soviet bombers? Well, you will if you read this. And that's just the start 
Someone had just sent me a documentary film called "Loose Change" which makes a case for the US government being responsible for blowing up the World Trade Centre. This book blows that little theory right out of the water. Extremely well researched and foot noted, the author goes into great detail about the backgrounds of all the persons involved in plotting 9/11 and even back to those who developed radical fundamentalism long ago and passed the ideas on to this generation. I felt that the author was very even handed in his portrayals of all concerned and spent much time laying out the whys and wherefores that pushed them into becoming the radicals that they are. An excellent read. I could scarcely put it down 
I found this to be very well researched and full of interesting information, however it took a lot of concentration to keep all of the carachters apart. I learned much about how the militant terrorists justify their actions and was dumfounded by how poor the cooperation between our anti terrorist agencies was. Definitely worth the effort to read it 
Well-researched book and well-written. It's amazing to trace the formation and progress of Al Qaed 
A must read for anyone who wants to understand 9/11. Well written, objective, and factual, it's the scariest book I've ever read. This is a warning and we must take heed. 
This book is divided into short reviews of various historic sites across the US. It's a great learning experience to read about some of the sites. Loewen gives the history of the site, including why it was established and often what the politics were at the time. There's some amusing information about misinformation that the sites portray. I have truly enjoyed reading this, and because of the way it's set up, it's easy to read in short bursts when you just have a few minutes 
I first thought that the book was pretty entertaining until the section on the Mining Hall of Fame. I actually know about this museum in Leadville Co. The author falsely alludes to the museum being a product of "big business" to promote their agenda. This museum actually took many years of interested individuals' efforts to create. The author seems to be upset because the museum doesn't tell the whole story about mining methods and their impact. This museum was never intended to do that. There are dozens upon dozens of mining museums across the country that does this. The Mining Hall of Fame primarily focuses on notable people who have contributed to mining in the US. Many of the inductees had not only a major impact on mining in the US, but also the world. The author is critical because the type of people HE would like to see inducted in the museum are not represented, and alludes to racism. He uses an example of a Native American "discovering" uranium in the 1950's in New Mexico, and asking why this person is not in the Hall of Fame. Gee, could it be that uranium was actually discovered many years before? After all, they did mine uranium in NM for the atomic bomb during the 1940's. I did not finish the book because it was obvious that using actual facts were beyond the scope of this book.... 
"Lies Across America" is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Disguised behind this book's apparently innocuous political correctness lies a new form of pernicious censorship. Even though the author claims that he has no intent to rip down monuments, much of his reasoning is deeply flawed. Instead of doing original research into the various subjects that he writes on, like a good professor should do, he summarizes a book, says it presents correct conclusions, and then says that the old thinking is wrong. Case in point, is the chapter on the burning of Columbia, South Carolina during the Civil War. Instead of looking at all the evidence on what happened when Sherman marched into the city in 1865, Loewen quotes two books which he seems to think draw the correct conclusions, and says that Sherman really had nothing to do with burning the city. Thus, almost all the historical markers in Columbia are wrong, or so Loewen seems to hold. Not the most convincing argument. Loewen goes on to say interesting things in his book but goes absolutely nowhere with them. For instance, he says that the Confederate Relic Room in Columbia may be "the least accurate museum operated by a state government anywhere in the United States." Why does he say this? What evidence does he have to support this other than the museum says that Sherman and his troops burned down 80 % of the city? Another diatribe against South Carolina is found in the appendix, where Loewen says that John Calhoun has no "redeeming characteristics, so I suggest removing him to museums from Marion Square in Charleston, the South Carolina State House, Calhoun College at Yale, the United States Capitol, and wherever else he sits in a place of honor." Loewen pretends to be upholding historical realism with quotes from Paul Fussell (a real Historian), but in fact his true agenda is just liberal censorship. We in America are fortunate that we do not have a strictly homogenous society. The United States is a society founded by all different types of religions and ethnicities and we should celebrate these differences. However, just because we disagree with cultures and ideas long ago, that does not mean they are not worth studying. There are always people that we agree with, and disagree with. The beautiful thing about open societies like America is that we can read and listen to people that we disagree with, and then make up our own minds. The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote long ago that "the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out." Censorship, whether propagated by liberals or conservatives, can only stand in the way of this marketplace of ideas. To say that an important 19th century politician like John Calhoun is not worth studying is just simply intellectually dishonest, especially from a professor. In conclusion, a book like this should have a place in the marketplace of ideas, but when it comes down to buying into Loewen's theories, I'm glad I checked it out at the library. 
Did you know that, in language backdated from the McCarthy era, Helen Keller was a "Com-symp," a Communist sympathizer? Well, no, because that wouldn't be so edifying. But it's the truth; she even sent Lenin a letter congratulating him on the Russian Revolution. And, this Alabama native was also a strong supporter of the NAACP. Of course, you won't find either one of those facts mentioned at her white-run, white-bread historical site home. Nor will you find the possibility of President James Buchanan's homosexuality mentioned by guides at his home. In Lies Across America, Loewen tours our country's historical sites, markers and monuments, knowing they likely have history wrong, to see just how wrong they got it -- and why. And, of course, understand what America really is requires that we face why our society has covered up, suppressed or distorted so much history 
Lies Across America: What our Historic Sites Get Wrong is an excellent book by James Loewen. He starts first with the western half of the United States since most history textbooks start with the eastern side. All of the information about historical markers is broken up into small sections for easy reading. Loewen proceeds to give state-by-state accounts of historical markers and their errors or in some cases their silliness. Many of the markers honor people as heroes who were in fact overt racists. Other markers are notorious for telling one side of the story. Most of the markers in the south dealing with the Confederacy are found to slant towards confederate sentiments or just to omit what really happened at historic confederate sites. We also find out that many markers dealing with Native Americans would refer to them as savages or other racist terms. In many instances I was appalled by the honoring of people like Jeffrey Amherst in Massachusetts who intentionally initiated the spread of smallpox among Native Americans to exterminate them from the landscape. Loewen also points out our country has never been able to come to terms with gay or lesbian leaders and honor them. You can take a tour of Willa Cather's original home in Nebraska but never once hear anything mentioned about her being a lesbian. Another instance of outright silliness is when Plantation homes talk endlessly about silverware while you tour them but fail to mention anything to do with who built the homes, did the work there, and were held in bondage to the owners. These are just some of the things that you'll find contained in this book. This book is very thought provoking and helps correct historical inaccuracy in the past. Historical inaccuracy prevents Americans from coming to terms with things that are important today such as: racism, homophobia, class inequality, and the glossing over of important events that could help us learn from them so as to prevent them from happening in the future. After all, George Santayna once admonished, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Do yourself a favor and read this book and let it help you start dialogue with others about our important and rich history 
It took me 3 years to read this book - should I end the review now? It's not because I am an extremely busy person, or because the book was so enormous that I read it endlessly for that long. No, the reason it took me 3 years to read this book is because it's just not very good. As excellent as Lies My Teacher Told Me was, this was equally bad. The book is a collection of small essays about various roadside memorials, or statues, or other historical tidbits that adorn the United States landscape. Loewen goes on to expound how incorrect all of them are, in the process suggesting that - now get this - there is racism in this country. Nothing in this book is eye-opening, by a long shot. While some essays do shed some interesting light on our history, the majority of these essays can be summed up by saying that white people have treated black people and Indians poorly. What a surprise. In his next book we may find out that the sun rises in the East. I'm utterly baffled how anyone can give this book 5 stars. This is a 2 star book which narrowly escapes the fate of a single star only because some of the history here is enlightening, to an extent. The vast majority deals with the deep south and it's predilection towards racism. In any book which the author doesn't have enough material to sufficiently back his claim, he will resort to such tactics as telling one side of the story or failing to give the full history of the situation. Loewen does both, often times leaving the essay a bare skeleton of what it might have been; leading the attentive reader wondering why things don't seem to add up on the pages of his text. I feel like the motivating force of this book was to make money, and little else. Perhaps there was a drive to create controversy. But the book is so tame that it can hardly do that. The pages are mostly a chore to get through, as evidenced by the 3 year period it took me to get through it. Truth be told, it may have been sitting on my night stand for 4 years. Either way, I found it dreadfully difficult to pick it up most days. Entirely not worth it 
Leaving not a state or an oppression unturned, Lies Across America is the enormous, exhaustive sequel of kinds to Lies My Teacher Told Me, taking a look at the monuments and markers across America that overwhelmingly paint a dishonest and unrelentingly positive view of America's past. What he provides here isn't just vital history, it tells the vital sociological truth about history's continued impact on regional landscapes. Many have complained that his section of the South is too long and too anti-Confederate (it's now controversial to be anti-Confederate?). But why it's such an important section is in representing the continued oppression and inequality of the region as part of a process of sugarcoating our history and who was disenfranchised in the process. Plus, his points demand to be considered - never has a work so thoughtfully, credibly, and humorously elucidated the flaws and implications in the way we tell history. Read this book with an open mind, and you'll never look the same way at our use of the word "discovered" (a loaded Euro-centric term that denies people living in certain areas for hundreds of years), the undertones - and occasionally overtones - that glorify racism in countless southern monuments, or the continued dialogue between how to represent historical items in a specific time and representing what actually happened. This is a book whose importance in representing both the past and present cannot be overstated 
James Loewen is an academic scholar who feels very strongly about the misinformation presented at places of historical significance. This book presents a listing of ninety- five historic sites, historic parks, and historic markers that don't quite get the story correct. Arranged in the book from west to east, each state in the U.S. includes at least one listing and some states have several. They all have one thing in common: They either lie outright or they present misleading information about what took place. Even though this book is titled "Lies Across America" the truth is that most of the places presented in this book are not necessarily giving out false information to tourists. Rather, they are failing to tell both sides of the story. The themes most commonly mentioned in the passages of this book are those that de-emphasize the role of Native Americans in the settling of the North American continent; fail to mention the bad treatment of African Americans; or that fail to tell the truth about the role of the Confederate and Union leaders in the Civil War. These historic places tend to explain things in a mostly positive way, leaving out anything bad in order to make people feel better about a person or place or to avoid controversy. Loewen has some interesting facts to share about different historic sites around the country, and some of the things you will read in this book will surprise you. He feels that the negative and/or controversial facts, even if they don't sound good, should still be presented in their entirety. Historic sites shouldn't try to hide the truth- they should let the facts be known to all. This book presents some good history lessons about some of the forgotten moments in U.S. history. Loewen writes in a clear manner, but I really wish he would refrain from using so many exclamation marks. On most every page of this book, he has an exclamation mark someplace. Maybe he is just so fascinated with his own work that he can't help himself. But I really wish he would refrain from his tendency to shout. History majors and other lovers of the past will enjoy this book most. It does get a little carried away with topics about the Civil War and coverage of oppressed groups of people. But I still think it's a good book with some important information for all to read. What we hear is not always the full truth, and Loewen wants this to change. 
What happened in the past is the past and what we say about it is history, James W. Loewen says as he opens Lies Across America (21). In the course of 95 vignettes Loewen demonstrates that much of the time history, as it is presented to the public through historic sites across the country, takes the form of non-controversial hogwash. Loewen points out that historic site visitors should realize that each location tells two stories: the story of the event or person it is commemorating and the story of its erection or preservation. The former is the truth and the latter is what those who erected or preserved the monument want the general public to think is the truth. Loewen argues many erectors suffer from the "heritage syndrome," the impulse to only remember what is attractive or flattering and ignore all the rest (47). Through an often humorous and sometimes sarcastic tone Lies Across America demonstrates that European-Americans decidedly feel that nothing important happened until they arrived on the scene and after that what they did was all that mattered. The title of one entry says it all: "Don't `Discover' `Til You See The Eyes of The Whites" (74). Time and time again Loewen illustrates how many historic sites and place names slight Native Americans. Many tribes are known by negative names - names their enemies gave to them - and some monument monikers stigmatize Indian religion and culture, such as Devil's Tower in Wyoming, whose name blasphemes local Indians because to them it is a holy site (133). Across the landscape, Native Americans do not get the credit they deserve, such as two historical markers in California that omit the Indians' contribution in building Sutter's fort and some of the Catholic Church's missions.  Loewen contends that some historical markers present invented history, while others don't present enough. A monument in Almo, Idaho memorializes a massacre that never took place (89-93). Visitors at the preserved homes of Helen Keller and 15th president James Buchanan see a wonderful array of period furniture and architecture but learn little of the famous people who lived there. Nothing is spoken of Keller's radicalism at her home and at the former Buchanan residence visitors do not hear about the former president's political views and homosexuality (367-370). Lies Across America teaches Americans to be highly critical of how history is portrayed across the landscape. It teaches visitors to take what is presented in every historic site at face value and not assume the monument depicts the whole truth. In the second appendix, Loewen includes questions every visitor should ask in order to get the real story of each monument or marker, and any visitor would benefit from asking the questions and uncovering their answers. The book's one weakness is organization. Each entry is arranged geographically, when it would be a smoother read if done topically. Organizing entries together by topic would avoid disjunction. However, the volume is highly readable and should be enjoyable to anyone interested in history, both academic and laymen. Every entry grabs readers' attention no matter if they have prior interest or knowledge in the subject presented. Its content generates a whole host of trivia questions and answers while also discussing the more important themes of American history - racism, sexism, slavery, and exploitation. 
Good insight into the mind of a talented thinker. Unfortunately he dwindles of toward the end, but definitely worth reading 
Tolstoy really hit on the fact that people work their whole lives in pursuit of something that will make them truly happy. "The more I get the happier I'll be". It doesn't work like that. Even at his best he was miserable, suicidal. The answer is God. Plain and simple. He is the only thing that Tolstoy discovered would lead him to a more peaceful,satisfying life. This was a great book 
The starting point of this work always fascinated me. Here is a great genius of mankind, recognized throughout the world as an immortal creator of Literature. He is the father of a large family and has a wife he has loved and who has loved him. He has great wealth .In other words here is a person who seems to have almost everything most human beings strive for in their lives and do not attain in any way close to the level at which he has attained them. And yet it all turns meaningless to him, and he in despair asks the question of whether there is anything to truly live for, what can give life true meaning. For he too senses that Death will take him and all his worlds, and their meaning away. His answer comes from within his own personal Christian faith. It is not a formal church faith but rather has to do with the message of God he hears in his heart, the message of love for all of mankind. Meaning is to be found according to Tolstoy in living in a spiritual way in which stress is placed in goodness with others and sharing with them whatever one has to give. The meaning of life is living according to this voice of God he hears within. This is the answer Tolstoy gave, but the evidence of his life suggests it did not satisfy him. For his questionings and doubts persisted throughout his lifetime, and his life did not end in some great gesture of affirmation and love but rather in his running from the once- beloved wife, who for years had embittered his life, as he hers. This work cannot of course compare to Tolstoy's great novels in scope or even in human interest. It is a look at a great man's ' soul' at one stage of his life but in giving that life omits many of the great skills Tolstoy made use of in other writing. As spiritual guide it has never seemed to me to provide the kind of answers to life meaning I have been looking for. Yet I understand how it may be of much help and consolation to all those who have suffered crises similar to that of Tolstoy. 
Tolstoy's honesty at his own selfish motives and his dissapointment with the true value of his accompleshments is wonderfully refreshing. His writing is so personal and open that I don't think anyone can walk away from this unmoved. I was dissapointed that he rejects the concept of a personal active God in the conclusion of his search 
Tolstoy's Confession was written during his time of deep internal spiritual struggle. Upon his renunciation of a life of aristocratic wealth and worldly pleasure, Tolstoy longed for the sense of true peace that he saw in the peasant class. Thus he embarked upon a search for meaning and happiness through a life of simple faith, manual labor, and poverty. He formulated his own Chrisian philosophy based on Christ's Sermon on the Mount stressing the existence of the Kingdom of God within the human heart, civil disobedience, and total pacifism. This "law of love" is explored deeply in confessional form throughout this autobiographical work. Although this particular approach to living the life in Christ ultimately did not cultivate in Tolstoy the deep inner peace that he yearned for, I feel that many of his ideas can be beneficial to people both within the Church as well as not. Regardless of the validity of his doctrine, it cannot be denied that this is an authentic, genuine, and very human confession of a man searching for God and some meaning to life on earth. Although I personally disagree with many of Tolstoy's points, I still hold his Confession to be a universal work that deserves a fair exploration by all who have ever felt a similar need for inner peace and true reconciliation with God 
Tolstoy's personal account of the existential crisis he faced after having published War &amp; Peace and Anna Karenina. If you've ever laid awake late at night wondering, "What will come from what I am doing now, and may do tomorrow? What will come of my whole life?" then Tolstoy's Confession is a book for you 
I'm a student who takes a philosophy class every semester, despite the fact that it does absolutely nothing for my graduation requirements. I always do well in the philosophy classes, but there is one part I hate: the reading. I was convinced that there was no point in philosophy that one could not talk through with another person; the words and semantics in philosophy, meant to clarify arguments when spoken, simply seemed a muddle to me when read. So it was with trepidation that I picked up my latest assignment--Tolstoy's Confession. I read it, and was shocked to find myself completely engrossed. Here, finally, was what I'd been looking for...the On the Road of philosophy, the self-effacing Jack Kerouac of the field. Everyone who's had worries about the fleeting nature of life and everyone who's worried that it all means nothing, this is your book 
What a surprise. From the title and cover art I was expecting a 4th of July - My country `tis of thee - stand at attention and salute book full of patriotic drivel. But this is a very substantial and thoughtful study of America's institutions and its critics. And the author has a gift for straightforward, easy to understand exposition. Dinesh D'Souza came to the U.S. as an exchange student from Bombay, India in 1978. He has had an illustrious career in this, his adoptive country. He's been active in politics as a Presidential advisor and in other capacities, but is mainly a scholar and writer. He spent ten years with the American Enterprise Institution and at the time of writing this book was a Fellow at the Hoover Institution. The first chapter tackles all the criticisms of America, from the Left to Europe to Islam. In a style that characterizes the entire book, D'Souza presents the arguments and/or complaints against America, its actions, culture, or whatever. He then replies with a calm, logical, polite but emphatic refutation. As well as being informative, this book is a lesson in the proper way to conduct a debate. Not all the complaints against America are refutable. America is not perfect and D'Souza is the first to admit it. He never engages in casuistry but admits the faults, past and present, with candor. In a Chapter titled "Two Cheers for Colonialism" he describes the wrongs of Western Colonialism, but also argues convincingly that by and large the benefits for those Colonized have outweighed the wrongs. He avers that the reason the West became the dominant civilization in the modern era is because it invented three institutions: science, democracy and capitalism. The freedom in the West derives from this combination and allows the human being to become a different sort of person than those still living in traditional societies. As D'Souza concludes: "America is a new kind of society that produces a new kind of human being. That human being - confidant, self-reliant, tolerant, generous, future oriented - is a vast improvement over the wretched, servile, fatalistic, and intolerant human being that traditional societies have always produced, and that Islamic societies produce now." 
Alaister Cooke became famous in Britain via his regular broadcasts termed 'Letter from America", whereby he attempted to explain current events within America to a British audience.  He lived in America - came to identify himself deeply with his adopted country and yet I do not think I ever heard him tackle what makes America great in quite the same manner as Dinesh D'Sousa who also is a first generation immigrant (and one who became a citizen). I am myself a first generation immigrant from Africa. And I was fascinated by the observations that D'Sousa made, having made some of them myself (though without the deep analysis and connecting the dots that D'Sousa did). I wonder - to those in America who hate this book; what is it that you hate so much? There are many who have moved here who have a deep respect for this country and its ideals. We understand that mistakes are made - but we come from countries where the political elites will not admit to those mistakes and worse, will never attempt to correct them. Like the flag burning debate - I sense that to many Americans who are born here, then the right to burn the flag and hate this country - are issues that are 'protected' under the Constitution. But to many who immigrate here - we can (and do) love this country deeply, acknowledge that errors have and will continue to be made but can also seperate the actions of some of its citizens instead of identifying them with the spirit that is America. D'Sousa's book should be read - it is not 'hate-filled' polemic, instead it reasonably asks some questions, provides some answers and established a framework for discussion and debate. All of which is done in the best sense of a liberal tradition. Dont be close minded - you dont have to agree - but to reject these ideas first you have to be familiar with them? 
This is a smooth, easy and short read. D'souza ideas have a nice and consistant flow to them that makes this a pleasure to read with out making this a war-n-peace dissertation on some of the cultural warfare present in our day. D'Souza's main thesis is to acknolwedge the debauchery caused by the unbridled use of freedom in our society from what he calls the ethic of authenticity. Also by acknowleding this he also points out where the Islamists and multi-culturalsts do not. This is the most important aspect of his book, where by that same freedom when engaged in virtues such as altruism have a greater meaning in the greater context of the culture and in the world. He talks about several key cultural issues in America and portrays them in an unapolgetic prose that acknowledges the short comings of America while also expressing them as great strengths. For instance, racism in America. We were the country that led the charge to abolish it. It took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans in battle to do it as well and our Republis survived. This is not to America's discredit becuase it has flaws but to its credit that it is unique in the sense that it overcame those flaws. Mr. D'Souza is quick to point out that the West has been responsbile for great progress in the world and that even in the tyranny of colonialism, his native India benefitted from the imposition of the British where they outlawed the practice of killing female infants, child marriage, and more. I found this book amazingly refreshing and I would assume that most multiculturalists, who continue to blame America first for all the woe's of the world will probably find it troubling. Mr. D'souza, I enjoyed reading every single page. As an American, a service-member in the military, a father, and husband in a two-parent home... I'm am convinced that some ways are better to live. This is not to the discredit of those who are chosing a different path but American altruism and invention are at the heart of almost everything that defines my life and for that I am unapologetic and greatful. For that I've seen first hand how the rest of the world revels in that same special 'stuff' that is unique to America. Thanks for articulating this as you have. It's refreshing to not have to trudge through some angry American historian who's ashamed to be an American. My hat is off to you sir! 
Got the Audio Book and his arguments are cogent and well reasoned. Well worth the money invested 
Dinesh D'Souza is the Thomas Paine of our day. His insight, logic, grasp of the English Language, and wit make him, I believe, the best political author alive. What's so Great About America is one of the greatest books I have read. He digs down beyond the usual debate over the war on terror and aptly defines it as a war between two mutually exclusive philosiphies: Freedom v. Coerced Virtue. He doesn't deny the faults in our system, but he shows that those problems are better than the alternative. This book is well worth the money I spent on it, and I am looking forward to reading other books by the author. It is a shame that the devisive climate of our country would make some people deny the brilliance of this book because it doesn't fit their point of view. There have been uncalled for opinions that don't reflect the book, and even quotes from the book taken out of context (someone claimed that he said that European violence agianst Native Americans was "isolated instances", when he actually said that "there were isolated instances of Europeans purposely spreading smallpox"). Don't believe the negativity, and buy this book 
This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it 
Without any prior knowledge of this book's contents and my urgency to find a book for a particular class of mine, I chose What's So Great About America solely based on the title, and I must say I was not let down. As I read the title, the question filled many thoughts in my head and made my curiosity run wild. The author Dinesh D'Souza, an Indian immigrant and now American citizen, gives his unique, and well researched, outside-in view on America. D'Souza is clearly conservative but still gives very insightful thoughts analyzing both liberal and conservative arguments alike. The general question he tries to answer is what many US citizens ask to themselves probably all the time; Why does everyone hate us? He argues his point by incorporating three different worldly critiques from Europe, Asia, and the Islamic world. Even though I am not very researched on any of the topics the author covers in the book, the arguments were clear and easily understood, while still being articulate and in-depth. His honest and really quite frank views were really refreshing and also well respected. This book helped revive in me an interest in my own country which was well faded. Being born and raised in the United States, I think I took a lot of things that are unique and really quite special in this country for granted, and this book brought about awareness to many topics that I had never thought about. I have, am, and always will be very proud to be an American, but after reading "What's So Great About America" I'm much more excited to call myself American. 
Dinesh D'Souza, who emigrated here from Calcutta in 1978, displays a level of ignorance of American history, politics, economics and culture that is laughable. But for the Immigration Reform Act of 1965 - which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat D'Souza as their pet token, yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises - D'Souza probably wouldn't even be in this country. For him to accuse both Pat Buchanan AND the Rev. Jesse Jackson of "hating" America demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse. Don't bother 
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false. On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated. Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable 
This book explains the reason why so many people "bad-mouth" the U.S. and "American culture", but yet, millions want to move to the U.S. either short-term or long-term. The truth is, the U.S. provides the best life in terms of wealth and freedom, and they just can't get that back home. The book is by a man who moved here, and explains, from the outside in, why the U.S. is so great. 
In fact, this a very good book for someone interested in this style of investing (ie. buying a handfull of rental houses for bettter or earlier retirement). Its easy to read and I found several important points not covered in some of the more famous books. You prolly needs to read a few more books before beginning an investment enterprise, but this shold be one of them 
This is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified. There is one major problem, the author talks very little about risk. She recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money. That's ok and many people have made money that way. Many people have also lost their shirt that well as well. The book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt, especially for the small investor - the target audience - who likely doesn't have much to lose. She should've included several case studies, some that look those who have successfully used leverage (debt), and looked at some who lost everything. Then she could've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success. Instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light, saying almost nothing about the risks involved. This is all well for her, she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country. But there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties, but everything else as well. Any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk. It's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards. Such an approach is bad medicine, and Ms. Thomas' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt, and for that reason I took off 3 stars. Beyond that, it's a very good starter book. 
This is my 3rd book on real estate investing and I must say that each is totally different, with different ideas and different strategies. I think it's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know. I like how she talks about goal setting, something I've learned from Tony Robbins and that I feel is really important. I like how she calculates the rate of return. I like her differing point of views. I would have never considered an adjustable rate mortgage before reading this book. Overall I learned a lot, despite having already read 2 other good books. A few things I didn't like: I would have liked more information on selecting and comparing properties. And especially calculating if I can afford it or not. The information she gives is quite good, but since this is the most important topic I think it deserved even more. The book is well worth the price and if you're serious about investing I highly recommend it. 
This book has gotten me excited about getting into single family rentals, while at the same time, it's not letting me get too hyped up in getting rich quick (as rich as you want to be). This book was a joy to read, and a page turner at that. I have read recent novels that were less exciting. This book is full of priceless real world examples. It also made me think of rental income and equity in a different light. The only downside, even though it spells every scenario out, I had to go to the internet to find out what some of the real estate words meant. All and all, worth it 
In her own conversational style, Suzanne P. Thomas communicates a wealth of information for the small investor in a compact package. While researching real estate investing and landlording, I read about a dozen books that I carefully selected from the library. Out of the dozen I read and the others I perused, this is one of two that I bought. This book is an invaluable resource, and I've read through the majority of it at least four times. This book begins by getting you thinking about your long term goals for investing. For example, is your focus on creating cash flow for income, or are you interested in capitalizing on appreciation? A nifty section of the book is on the subject, "Why Doesn't Everyone Buy Real Estate?" This small section changed the way I thought about real estate investing. After discussing obstacles to investing, Thomas clearly conveys that capitalizing on real estate takes patience. You won't find Thomas trying to fill your head with get-rich-quick schemes or promises of unrealistic fast returns. One of Thomas' statements is a clincher. Thomas says, "Just remember that there is a difference between investing and speculating. Speculators need to get out before the market tanks, and this can be difficult to time correctly. Investors have a long term plan that can handle ups AND downs." About the time I read Thomas' book, I still had lingering thoughts about "flipping" properties. I have to admit that "flipping" is enticing. Although people do make money flipping real estate, this method is a gamble. So, unless you have a lot of cash to invest that you can afford to lose, I wouldn't recommend it. The chapter on "Selecting Properties" was especially helpful. I do not consider myself a "Slum Lord" and want to own properties that my family would be pleased to live in. We just completed work on fixer-upper home in a modest, older neighborhood. The home is now a nice place with some class, and we've enjoyed renting it to another family who fell in love with it. In Thomas' book, there are excellent chapters about loans (with sharp insights into ARMs), 1031 exchanges, qualifying tenants, etc. Each chapter has multiple tidbits of information. WHAT THIS BOOK IS NOT: Although this book contains good information about landlording, it is not a nuts and bolts landlording book, nor does it profess to be. You should seek the nuts and bolts from landlording books, from other investors, from a real estate attorney, and also from an experienced investor/teacher (community education programs usually have someone in the area who is an expert and teaches investment and landlording classes). This book is excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a down-to-earth, information-packed book on this subject. I hope Thomas writes more books on landlording and related subjects.

The second edition of this title was released January, 2006. However, Amazon.com takes most searches to this page for the old edition. To get to the page for the second edition, click above on Other Editions. The second edition is the same price but you'll get 25% more pages, and 10% of the old pages have been edited or replaced to bring them up-to-date 
I first read this book three years ago and it still stands as one of the best books I have ever read on real estate investing. If you have read any amount of REI books you know that this area of publishing it is flooded with 'motivational' books that are full of fluff and short on details (Rich Dad series comes to mind). Suzanne P. Thomas's book delivers the real info that you are looking for. She offers pro insights on cashflow, down payment, selecting a property, different loans to consider, marketing, finding the best tenants, day-to-day details, etc. The focus is on single family rentals, but the info can be applied to most real estate investing situations. If you are a beginner investor this is the book you want to start with. 
This book is ideal for the novice investor or beginner investor looking to get into rental houses. I read the first edition of this book and was very impressed. I then read the second edition and was pleasantly surprised at the amount new info. The author updated a lot and added a lot of additional info, so if you have read the first edition already, it's certainly still worth reading the second. The author provides literally everything you need to know, from how you will qualify a rental property for mortgages, insurance, ads, how to screen tenants, literally everything. I wish I had read this book first before I had read my other real estate books, as this book answers literally all of my questions I had trouble getting answers for. Well worth the purchase! 
I've read this book 3 times. It is written very clearly with specifics about the author's experiences in purchasing and managing rental homes, very little "fluff". Geared more towards beginning investors, but intermediate investors will also pick up some good tips. If you're starting out in this business, get this book 
Since this is one of many previous reviews, I will be brief. This is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever read. But not the easiest one. The first time I read it I felt overwhelmed and undereducated, until I saw a another book written as a companion to the novel. It helped a lot with the unfamiliar cultural references, of which there are many. And I felt better. I read it a second time, on a couple of flights back and forth across the Pacific (perfect place - you're captive, with few distractions). And it took a few more hours than that to finish. In the end, if you can read no other novel, or if you are going to be isolated on an island with no chance of escape, and can take a book to read, take this one. You won't regret it 
I truly feel sorry for Pynchon, knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life. By all means, if you want to read it, get it from the library as I strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery. Does anyone really care that a man's sexual episodes predict German V rockets falling on England? Is it really important to World Literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from? The so-called Intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same Great Thinkers that believe Ulysses by James Joyce is the best novel of all time. I would rather read the worse writing of de Balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels. Both these "novels" are truly "sound and fury .... signifying nothing." 
Perhaps extreme paranoia is one way out of, or at least our only healing response to our existential loneliness. (The other way, of course, is love, but this takes a second place in Pynchon's world view.) "They have done this to me, I am Their victim", is perhaps a more comforting world-view, than "I am completely irrelevant." At least one can have some kind of fun or meaning to life in finding out who They are and why They have done it. thelectern.blogspot.co 
Since there are already 250 reviews of this book, I am just going to say that the earlier portion of the book may contain the very best English-language prose style ever written--even better than Joyce and Nabokov! Oh, and also, Pynchon was not only robbed of a Pulitzer Prize, but also (so far) of a highly deserved Nobel Prize (also true of John Ashbery) 
I lived in Germany a few years ago and found this book in a train station. Someone had just walked off and left it. After about ten pages, realizing that Pynchon was an intellectual rip-off artist, I secured it a trash can where no one could find it. I like to think I protect the public from pollution. 
Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite. Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con. A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus. There are two principle types of literay work: 1. That which is to be read. and of course 2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face. Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category. You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work: Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow. You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!! What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity 
I was expecting a real blockbuster ending to this series, and I was a bit disappointed. I thought the killers would turn out to be people way more involved in the series, and I was disappointed that they were really fringe characters. I felt let down by that. Still, you can't go wrong with a Mariah Stewart book. She's one of the best out there when it comes to keeping you rivited. 
Working a case in Central America, FBI Agent Connor Shields stumbles across a horrifying sight-dozens of young children being herded into a cargo truck, obviously doomed to a future of slavery or as unwilling participants in the international child sex trade. Conflicted because he's on a very important mission, Connor is about to intervene when he's accosted by a colleague who assures him that everything is under control, that both local and US authorities are on the case. Heartened by this news, Connor departs for his scheduled rendezvous. What he doesn't realize, however, is that his trusted associate is in league with the kidnappers, and that, because of his poor timing, he and all those he holds dear have been placed in mortal danger. The fourth and final book in Stewart's "Dead" series (following Dead Wrong, Dead Certain, and Dead Even), Dead End cannily combines two disparate premises (the investigation into the deaths of several schoolgirls at the hands of a serial killer and the travesty that is the child sex trade), resulting in a tale guaranteed to hold readers' spellbound until they reach the last page. Although her writing is not as polished as one might expect from such a seasoned author, Stewart nevertheless manages to wring all the tension she can out of her compelling subject matter, offering her audience a book that provides suspense and social commentary in equal doses, a story dealing that effectively illustrates the toll crime takes on victims, criminals, and law enforcement officials.  
Good, but not great. Stewart tries a little too hard in this book. It's still good, and I would recommend reading it, but it's not worth reading at the hardcover price 
If you haven't read the first three books in Mariah Stewarts "DEAD" series--DEAD WRONG, DEAD CERTAIN, and DEAD EVEN--go pick up a copy today. Although not necessary to enjoy DEAD END, you'll get a much better feel for some of the main characters--plus just three really good reads--if you read the other books first. That said, DEAD END centers around Dr. Anne Marie McCall, an FBI profiler, and her new love, police Detective Evan Crosby. At a mutual friend's wedding, Evan is surprised over the jealousy he feels by how close Annie still is with the Shields family. Her fiance, undercover agent Dylan Shields, was murdered two years ago during a covert op. The Shields family, with its many children all in FBI positions, is a close-knit one who still has a place for the memory of what Annie and Dylan were to each other. Evan, attempting to get over his jealousy but knowing that Annie will never be at peace until she knows what really happened to Dylan, suggests that they take one last look at the file on his death--hoping that maybe this one last shot might provide Annie with the closure she needs, and that a new set of eyes might come up with new leads in the investigation. What they uncover are more questions, missing files, and situations that prove more and more dangerous. Who was really the intended victim that night? Does the locale of Dylan's death have something to do with the current case Evan is working on? Why are members of the extended Shields family ending up in questionioning situations? Ms. Stewart has written another winner. I'm sad to see the "DEAD" series end, but I was happy to see that with the release of DEAD END all the questions from the last three books were answered. A real winner, you won't want to miss this book. It's an excellent offering in the romantic supsense genre! 
Anne Marie McCall is a psychologist and one of the FBI's most skilled profilers. She is still grieving for her dead fiance, Special Agent Dylan Shields, who was killed more than two years earlier in an undercover operation that turned sour. Pennsylvania Detective Evan Crosby is now Annie's lover, but he is having a hard time competing with Dylan's memory. After a nasty quarrel with Annie, Evan suggests that both he and Annie reexamine Dylan's death to see if they can uncover any fresh leads. Little does the couple know that by opening up this old case, they are trespassing into dangerous territory. Meanwhile, Evan has other pressing items on his plate. A series of wealthy young teenaged girls have been found dead, the victims of a serial killer, and he and his colleagues are trying to find clues that will lead to the perpetrator. Equally perplexing, when more corpses of teenaged girls turn up, they are of unidentified Hispanic girls who have never been reported missing by their parents. Thus begins Mariah Stewart's "Dead End," a fast-paced romantic thriller that features engaging protagonists and a compelling plot. Stewart deftly balances her large cast of characters, including FBI agents, county detectives, and assorted villains and victims. The dialogue is, for the most part, realistic, although there are some stilted exchanges when the loose ends are tied up at the end. Stewart inserts clues and hints along the way to give the reader a fair shake at guessing the outcome, and she also puts in enough red herrings to keep us off balance. However, the outcome will not greatly surprise most attentive readers. To her credit, Stewart expertly handles the love story between Evan and Annie. They are equals in every sense of the word; both are respected professionals who value one another not just as lovers, but also as human beings. Their relationship provides a solid backdrop to the story, and as their investigations progress, they learn to rely on and trust one another implicitly. Annie and Evan make a good team, both on and off the job. "Dead End" works because Mariah Stewart is a competent writer who doesn't condescend to her public. Her prose style is clear and crisp, her story is complex but not convoluted, and she is not afraid to kill off some good people for the sake of realism. Fans of romantic suspense will find "Dead End" involving and entertaining 
In December 2002, FBI Agent Shields had completed his mission in Santa Estela, Central America. He was on the docks, en route to the boat that would begin his journey back to the States, when he stumbled upon men and vehicles in the process of buying children. It was a child-slave trade obviously. As Shields pondered what he should do, his cousin (another agent) appeared and informed him that the child-slave ring would end that very night. Shields met his boat contact and went home, secure in the knowledge that his cousin's team would save the children. Dr. Anne McCall, FBI Profiler, had been engaged to Dylan Shields two years ago. But Dylan had been killed in an undercover drug deal gone bad. The Shields clan still considered Annie to be one of their own though. The entire clan was either in the FBI or retired from it. Annie knows she is lucky. Not only does she have the deep affection of the entire Shield family, but she also has found love a second time in the form of Homicide Detective Evan Crosby. Annie and Evan attend the wedding of Mara, Annie's sister, to Aiden Shields. It is there that Evan realizes the relationship between Annie and himself could go no further until Dylan's death is put to rest. Evan offers to look into Dylan's case, as a fresh set of eyes, with Annie. It is something the couple plan to do together, as time permits. Evan's primary focus is on a serial killer. Pre-teen girls were being targeted. Some of the victims have a tattoo. Those with the tattoo have no ID and no one has filed missing reports on them. As Annie and Evan investigate the serial killer and Dylan's death, coincidences begin showing. Then people with possible leads begin to die. As both cases begin to make even a little bit of sense, Annie realizes that she may be walking around with a target on her back. **** This is the fourth and last novel in the "Dead" series. Fans of the CSI television series will adore this book as the two main characters work through all the evidence. The plot is complex and will keep your mind working as you follow along. If you have read the other books of the series, you will see familiar names and faces. By using past characters in secondary roles this time around, the author has made the story seem more realistic. Excellent series that I highly recommend to all. **** Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews 
In Avon County, Pennsylvania, Homicide Detective Evan Crosby is sick when he sees the fourth victim in under a month. Each casualty was pretty young female, ages 12 - 14, attending a private school, and left without shoes. His lover, FBI profiler Annie Marie McCall tries to give him solace, but knows how difficult coping with this case is. At the wedding of Annie's sister to a Shield sibling, Evan feels left out as the happy occasion is more a wake to FBI Agent Thomas Shield, who was assassinated. Upset, Evan leaves when another girl is killed without a word to Annie who is inside the Shield zone since Thomas was her fianc, which bans the detective from entry. Not long afterward, knowing she needs closure, Evan offers a fresh pair of eyes in investigating the murder. As they work together on the Shield murder and the serial killings, an agency insider watches them very closely because he will have them eliminated if they get to close to him or his young girl black market ring. The fourth Dead tale is a potent romantic suspense tale starring two likable protagonists in love yet struggling to form a relationship because of the ghost of her murdered fianc. The Shield Zone is tighter than ever, denser than a black hole as no matter escapes this closely knit family to the chagrin of Evan. Annie is terrific as she balances her second strike of love's lightning bolt with her first hit, but still needs closure, which Evan knows means uncovering who killed Thomas. Mariah Stewart is dead on with this tale and series. Harriet Klausner 
I'll keep my review pretty short; pretty much all the good points the other reviewers wrote are pretty much true. So I'll just add my two cents. 1) This is mainly futures trading, even though some plays sometimes apply to stocks/options/forex. Still even if you're not into futures, the section on psychology, methodology, trading plan, etc. are worth the book. 2) The examples in this book will really help you understand how a real trader should trade - emotionlessly. The whole idea that you need to have chosen a stop exit, target exit, entry point, whether you should scale in/out is very well described here. If you're looking for forex trading, I recommend "Beat The Odds" by Igor Toshchakov. His english isn't perfect but the book is filled with useful info 
This book is amazing! It is a very engaging read and never gets stale. The knowledge you get out of it is priceless. The tactics I learned in this book were very successful when applied to swing trading for me. Highly Recommend 
Well, Amazon invited me to write a review about this book. I must give it 5 stars because I gave other books on trading which were not that good 5 stars as well. I bought this book based on the reviews already written here. And yes, I was quite delighted. I liked the chapters on psychology very much. I'd like to cut these chapters and paste them into Vadim Graifer's book "Techniques of Tape Reading", and delete his chapters about his losing experiences as a beginner. That would be the perfect trading book for me. The setups, they're okay. But I'm using none of them since I got my own pair of setups. But they're a great starting point for someone who's traded with no setups at all. There is one reviewer who's concerned that Mr. Carter might be blabbing away too many secrets. Don't you worry about that. Like William Gann said: a chemist's biggest secret won't make the carpenter any wiser. You shouldn't take over Carter's writing one-to-one. I didn't like what he said about Moving Averages and Stop levels. If you use a technical stop be sure that you really want to lose that much money. As a scalper for years now, and quite successful, his suggestions were beyond my comfort level. You gotta find out for yourself how to fine tune your system. I've found out for myself that I am not the kind of a trader who goes for the big moves. Use Carter's suggestions to create your own trading system. This book will definitely help you. Actually there were some ideas that I could use to improve my trading. All in all, Mr Carter is very (!) generous in sharing information and knowledge with the reader/trader. There's sure something for everyone which can be used to make money right away. But only experience will make you a better trader 
This is an easy to read book with very specific trade setups and easy to follow instructions. So far after 2 weeks using the morning gap play it is consistently profitable. If you've traded you know two weeks doesn't prove anything, but it's nice to see something work right off the bat. A couple of his plays in the book I'm not comfortable with but I haven't tried them, and a couple of them require buying his tradestation codes, to be fair he does tell you how they work so if you want to code them yourself you could. No wishy washy theory here, just simple to follow set ups with profit targets with stop loss and real good advice on risk and amount of account needed per contract and how to wright a trading business plan and some info on computers. Overall a good book 
Well, I wrote about 10 reviews on trading books so far, so that should clear off some doubts of the previous reviewer. This book just covers almost every parts of trading, from psychology, money management, risk, trade plans, daily routines, computer hardware, software, useful websites and even a part on health requirements. Big portion of the book is on setups that the author recommended. Those setups seem more on Indexes and Futures trading, plus you must have required software and services (tradestation, esignal) to run, so it may not be suitable for all. Interesting enough, the author quoted many books I have read and reviewed before. He just absorbs and takes things in action better than me. E.g. he can explain Mark Douglas's concepts in `Trading in the Zone' better than what I can find in the book itself. That would be credited to his good writing style and openness, I just got the feeling that he really wanted to help inexperienced traders out in this book. Never mind that there is some selling about his products along the way. Ok with me 
Every reviewer rates this an exceptional book and every reviewer has only rated one book, this one. Isn't that strange (rhetorical question). I read a great many reviews of trading books; go to a book by Elder or one of the other market gurus and you'll find reviewers who have read and reviewed scads of trading books. There's of course no way for me to know, but maybe the author's real talent is writing trading book reviews 
I bought this book due to the excellent reviews and I agree with all the 5 stars that everyone has given it. It is so good that I worry too many people reading it, since it is going to be very difficult to take their money if they apply what they read. So please don't read it, I won't make money so easely. 
There are at least 10,000 trading books out there. I know because I have probably read half of them. I also believe I have learned something from every one of them. Most of the books are like Doctors, they specialize in one area or another. This book, "Mastering The Trade" is different. Its the "General Practioner" that really knows what he is doing. John Carter really covers enough ground to help a trader get profitable. He covers all areas of trading - hardware, software, psychology, basic mechanics of markets, and most importantly a traders business plan. Just those items alone more than cover the cost of this book, but then he also adds about a dozen market set-ups. Mr Carter does not just show one or two of each set-up like most books, he shows dozens of each example. Some more profitable than others, but enough to give you a good feeling of what he is trying to explain. While I do believe this book alone will not make you a great trader, I know it will help you in your journey. This is not an absolute beginner book, you need some market knowledge to get through this comfortably. With that said, I think this is one of the best books out there on trading. I am giving it to my son who has recently become interested in trading after he learned about compound interest. Watch out world, because he is only 14 and is going to start much better prepared then the rest of us! One last note about this book, you will not read it and become a better trader. Learning to trade is like learning to drive a car. You can't read a book and then go out and drive successfully. You have to practice. You have to see whats working and do more of it, and you have to see whats not working and do less of that. And most importantly you have to do it enough so you get to the point where you feel comfortable with anything the road (or market) throws at you. Good luck 
A hands on authentic book. Very practical. Easy to follow. Excellent focus on the psychology of trading and the management of trading 
This is an excellent text, which will allow you to become a decent beginning trader. Carter discusses psychology, computers, trading platforms, quote software, market sentiment indicators, and gives you 8 trading setups. A brilliant book 
OUTSTANDING book! Mark provides very practical examples of promoting your product or service...It is easy to read and there is plenty of white spaces on each page. This makes it easy for any type of notation and ease of use of the highlighter...I read the book in one sitting while awaiting my delayed flight and I was excited after reading the book and I was not upset with the delayed flight...The only section I disliked in the book was the section on magic BUT I understand his viewpoint of why he wrote about magic...Buy a copy and see how you can profit rather quickly and learn about magic 
I bought this book because I have read article written by Mark before. He is an excellent writer and very clearly presents difficult information. He goes above and beyond on this book. It was hard to put down even when it was 1 am. I have read it once and put it aside for a few days to digest all that he gives you. I have it on my calendar to pick up and reread again next week. It may take a time or two through the book to truly get it (and by get it I mean absorb it, believe it and implement it). He provides concrete examples, concise practical laws of marketing and business building. An excellent read and worth multiples to your business if you implement even 1/100th of the information he provides 
I consider myself a marketing expert. I've built two hugely successful million-dollar mail order companies within just a few years and thought I knew ever trick in the book from Gary Halbert to Dan Kennedy. And I found a new gem in this book! There wasn't anything "new" per se but the way the author had "updated" the importance of marketing techniques was a refreshing polish on things that have gotten dusty over the past few decades. His point of view has been welcomed and long-needed in direct response. He actually includes testing examples that he's done. For instance he tested using the "7" which is Ted Nicholas' marketing trick from eons ago. He gives you information on when he tested the $99 price-point versus $95 and $97. He give you exact figures on which pulled the most. Many other authors who talk about the "7s" will tell you that they pull more but never give actual figures on which pulls the most, probably because they've never done a real-life test themselves. This book focuses on the "offer" and the "benefits" to the customer. As broad as that may seem this author seems to get deep into the nitty-gritty on EXACTLY how to push people's buttons to get people to buy. And within 3 seconds. And he does it in a fun, easy-to-follow, lightning fast manner that makes reading the book cover-to-cover a snap. All of the traditional marketing "secrets" are brought up to the 21st century standards. There is so much information that bombards people everyday that you have to HIT PEOPLE QUICKLY AND HIT 'EM HARD. Other marketing books by the greats are outdated because of that huge main fact. Life isn't the same as it was before the Internet. Therefore we have LESS TIME to get people's attention. This book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for those of you who have studied Dan Kennedy, Ted Nicholas, Gary Halbert, Jeff Paul, or any of the other marketing greats. This is an UPDATE for the 21st century and is VERY NECESSARY if you are going to sell things to people who are becoming desensitized to advertising. And if you think you're a marketing expert, you need this book EVEN MORE! Isn't it the truth that those of us who think we know so much about marketing that we tend to "lock out" new discoveries (or forget about the "oldies" but goodies)...and then we become dinosaurs (perhaps as Dan Kennedy and others have become)? And that's why, as a marketing expert, you need this book more than anyone else...BECAUSE YOU NEED A BLOCK OF WOOD TO KNOCK YOU UPSIDE YOUR HEAD! As a marketer you can NEVER think you are an expert because the world is changing too much! HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I will even go so far as to say that this is one of the TOP 5 marketing books out there! And that's saying a lot from someone who has most every marketing book there is 
I found this book really enlightening, both from a business and a personal perspective. Mark's writing style is relaxed and friendly which made the book an easy read. It is also very clear - no room for ambiguity. I especially liked his comment on Think and Grow Rich - it has certainly made me think about reading a book versus acting on the information shared in the book. 
At around 200 pages, The Irresistible Offer is not exactly a hefty tome. Actually, author Mark Joyner had to use a few formatting tricks to get the book up to even that modest page count. One cannot guage the value of a book by its size, though. In this easy to read text, Joyner presents information beyond value to any business person. Whether your business is online or offline, you can apply the lessons of The Irresistible Offer to your marketing and promotional efforts. The book's subtitle, How to Sell Your Product or Service in 3 Seconds or Less, only tells part of the story. Yes, Joyner does focus a great deal of time on those things which have impact on a potential buyer or customer immediately. Because we are all barraged with information and sales messages on a continuous basis, it's so important as marketers for us to be able to break through the clutter and get our messages heard. This book definitely defines how that can be accomplished. It's more than that, though. The Irresistible Offer also talks about how our marketing messages can be shared and spread - delving in to the essense of so-called "viral marketing". This is something you have probably heard about. Joyner does a great job of explaining viral marketing in an easy to understand way. At all points of the book, clear examples are used to help make important points and show the principles being discussed. They help to make this book one you will read not just once, but probably many times 
The Irresistible Offer gives you a simple formula to use in marketing your product or service. It can be applied to written and verbal sales 
Mark Joyner is that well known in the marketing world you wonder if he can actually live up to his own reputation in a book. Fact is he's that on to it you can't help but get stuck right into this book and what it stands for. His ability to relate in a way that pretty much any business person can understand is undeniable. He breaks down what many marketing "gurus" try to make as complicated as possible, into easy to apply logic. That is the brilliance of this book. So many business's get sucked into promoting their ego instead of tapping into what their customers really want. This book will get you in touch with that. At the end of the day thats what will make you a dollar. What you want to spray into the marketplace about yourself, your customer won't even hear. Boil it down, take out your ego, get to the core of what makes your offering an actual "offer" in the first place. This book will help you do that. Don't worry, if you follow the advice they will come. John Blake Blue Rocket Business Systems [.. 
Mark Joyner gets straight to the point. He explains in plain language the exact steps you need to take sell your product or service. He explains exactly what makes a business stand out above their competitors, and how you can do it too. I am sure I can make money using the ideas in this book 
Just started and finished this book in one four hour run. In marketing there is one genuine good book out of ten copycats. This is one of the genuine ones. This book is written in an easy to understand language, with great examples and analogies. It is about how to position and market your product or service, no matter what it is. A must read 
Good read for those who want to market their product or service with the power of words and psychology. A must read for anyone in the advertising industry 
The history of the book when it was published tells it all. After a media blitz and great anticipation with what would be written - due to Brando pocketing an absolutely huge advance - the sales were so abysmal that it was discounted by fifty-percent or more less than two weeks after sitting mostly unsold on store shelves. It was supposed to be the reflections of arguably the greatest actor of his generation, but unfortunately Songs My Mother Taught Me is nothing but psycho-babble with a text that can be read (skimmed) very quickly. The only thing I determined was Brando very early in the writing process decided he was going to be as difficult on this "set" as he reportedly was with most of his film directors. Next to Gerald Ford's brief and boring book published after his controversial presidency, Songs My Mother Taught Me is perhaps the most disappointing publication by a major public figure in the latter portion of the last century. 
After I read Marlon Brando's own memoirs, my view on him changed. That he was one of the most brilliant actors in history is a fact most people are aware of, but what fewer know is that he was a very intelligent man who helped discriminated folk groups more than many. I knew this even before I read this book, SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME. But what I was not aware of, was how sensitive and funny he could be when he felt comfortable. I believe much of his "tough" behavior simply was an image. Not all the time, of course, he was very masculine and could --which he admits in this book-- be brutal at times, but this side of him is obviously exaggerated by the press through the years. After a four-page long introduction by Robert Lindsey, who put this book together with Brando, the actor opens chapter I with the sentence, "As I stumble back across the years of my life trying to recall what it was about, I find that nothing is really clear." I respectfully disagree with this. Brando tells his story with so many interesting, funny and sad details and comments that I can't do anything else. The sentence that follows, however, is more telling -- "I suppose the first memory I have was when I was too young to remember how young I was. I opened my eyes, looked around in the mouse-colored light and realized that Ermi was still asleep, so I dressed myself as best as I good and went down the stairs, left one foot first on each step." Ermi was the childhood love of Marlon (or 'Bud,' as he was referred to at that time). She was his nurse maid, and he writes lovingly about how she took care of him during his earliest years. But only a few months after his first school year began, she married a man Marlon never got a chance to even see and left him. Although Marlon tells the story with understanding, there is a clear bitterness between the lines. At the time Ermi said good-bye, Marlon discovered a heart-breaking fact -- his parents were abused to alcohol. This did, of course, not make the situation more pleasant. Marlon's picture of his mother, Dorothy is filled with bitter-sweet love, while his father, Marlon Sr., is described as a "brutal bar-fighter." He had his reasons. During his teens, he and his sisters (two and four years older than him) had to bring their mother home from the police station often once a week after a "night out." In these circumstances, it happened now and then that their father took his wife upstairs and beat her. One time when this was the case, Marlon ran up to the bed-room, put his teeth in a Goliat-position and said terrifying, "If you ever touch her again, I will kill you." In spite of such unhappy memories, Brando's pre-acting years are also often described with much humor. Escpecially one episode impressed me. While he was in a military school --which he hated but his father had sent him there-- one thing annoyed him more than anything else -- a bell that rang every quarter. One night he stole the bell and buried it. The next day, the school had never been as quiet before. They finally had to use a tromphet to make the ring signals, and every time the instrument made a sound, Marlon fell on the ground with laughter. When he was twenty, he went to New York to make a living as an actor (though "only to survive"). He began his career on Actor's Studios, where later many other great actors, James Dean among them, would start their careers. His "wonderful teacher Stella Adler" saw what she had between her hands, and after some small parts in a couple of so-so Broadway plays, he got his chance as Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee William's masterpiece A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947. Brando was praised from the beginning on. But Brando himself has several times --also in this book-- claimed that he don't care about Stanley Kowalski, a brutal bar-fighter (do you see the resemblances?). "He isn't impressed of anything, I detest the character," is Brando's words, which puzzled a whole world, myself included. Marlon Brando's portrait of Stanley Kowalski is --together with his portrait of Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront and Don Corleone in The Godfather-- the best acting he ever did. Streetcar was filmed in 1951, and was a huge hit. It made Brando world famous. But he admits in his autobiography that he truly would have been happier if he had not been a movie star. Brando describes each film he appeared in with interesting and funny notes, how he became the characters he went into, etc. A deilightful surprise was that he actually co-wrote a lot on several of his movies, including Sayonara, The Young Lions, The Godfather, Last Tango in Paris, The Missouri Breaks and Apocalypse Now. The characters in these movies were his creations in every way. Although he has left out information about his three marriages and comes out with only a little --actually very little-- stuff about his children, Brando's private life is tension and funny reading through the whole book. He tells shamelessly about a handful of his affairs with all kinds of women, about his love for animals, about his temperament --like when he knocked out the front windows of a bus with both fists-- and when he gradually learned to control this anger. The life on Teitora --the island where he had the happiest moments of his life-- are described with deep love and yet honesty for the Tahitian people. There is something for everyone here, but personally, I found the chapters where he confirms his political opions most interesting. I agreed with almost everything. It helped me a lot to understand human behavior and it was a very good source to a school test I was forced to do while I still was reading the book. No doubt. Marlon Brando was one of the greatest actors in history, we know that. But besides, he was also one of the greatest storytellers in history. Buy, rent or steal this book (personally I bought it here on Amazon.com), read it, and then you know everything you need to know about the genius Marlon Brando. You don't need to be a fan of him already to enjoy this book, but it is doubtful that you can read it through without becoming it. Forget the ridicilous tabloid-books - this is the one you need 
I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK AS IT WAS A PRESENT TO MY MOTHER. I HEARD GOOD REVIEWS ABOUT IT ON THE WBAI RADIO HERE IN NEW YORK 
Marlon Brando-in my opinion- is the world's greatest actor. This autobiography is one of the best I have ever read-if not the absolute best. I own several biographies, and often, I get bored, put the book down, and never touch it again. NOT WITH THIS BOOK! Marlon Brando was made into a person with this book. He was sensitive and caring-or at least that's how the book made me perceive him. I've read this book three times since it came out a decade ago, and am sure I will read it again in the future. I've loaned my copy out to friends that weren't particular fond of Marlon Brando, but after each person read this book, they fell in love with it. Now, they are avid fans of his movies. I urge anyone interested in old Hollywood, or films in general to read this. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A MARLON BRANDO FAN, but BEWARE, you just might be when you finish the book 
This book provides great insight into Marlon Brando, the man, and his view of the world and himself in it. Marked by poignant, eloquent, intelligent, and fascinating interludes on philosophy, history, and--perhaps most surprisingly--the craft of acting itself, readers will enjoy getting to know the Brando behind the tabloid images and salacious gossip mongers. Brando also almost succeeds in his thinly-veiled project of deconstructing his own myth. Perhaps betraying just how deeply his father's early and constant beratements of his abilities and potential affected him ("You'll never amount to anything"), Brando cannot seem to believe that he did anything out of the ordinary. He is beyond disparaging about his own acting and dismissive of his titanic achievements in cinema, art, and cultural redefinition. Generally considered the finest actor of all time, Brando--in two separate decades--twice revolutionized acting and redefined the medium. He was a liberal and a humanitarian eminently more interested in making a contribution to humankind in some other (in his words, "more important") endeavor than acting. He several times states that not all is black and white, it is a "polka dot" world, and he is understanding of the shortcomings of others. Yet he is a harsh judge of himself and seems to view his own life in either/or terms. He succeeded in important ways in helping mankind or he frittered away his talents on the meaningless if lucrative game of acting. Still, his achievement as well as the pervasiveness of his cultural influence (think blue jeans and t-shirts), despite his own discounting of it here, was remarkable. Sensitive, thoroughly enjoyable, very funny, and exceedingly humble, this memoir is not complete, but it gives us a window into the mind of one of the most remarkable and influential personalities of the last century. 
Brando was also a terrific storyteller. This book puts to rest so many rumors and gives an honest self-appraisal of this large and largely misunderstood genius. His life was filled with deepest tragedy, but Brando managed to stay positive and he kept his killer sense of humor. The book is funny! Brando was an actor, but also a humanitarian and a true friend to those without a voice. I encourage fans to hear his story from his own voice, rather than one of the many gossip-filled bios available 
The paradox that is Marlon Brando has always been the allure for me, besides the obvious brillance as an actor. I'm far from alone in my opinion. I think it was appropriate that he didn't write about his marriages and children. Such things, as we know, are private matters too painful and complex. Confessionals and tell-all autobiographies are not interesting anyway, and rarely do they reveal the true character of their subjects. I learned a lot about who Brando was just by reading his description of autumn leaves in Libertyville and the night sky over Tetiaroa. Brando was a human being with passions, demons, and needs just like the rest of us. He loved Chimps, traveling, Afro-Cuban music, fart jokes, and good books. He was more instinctual than analytical. This is evident by the terse analysis he gives of his film characters. Brando did not "piss away his talent" as Dick Cavett had said on an NPR phone interview last year. As this book reveals, Brando never had the acting bug. That's why he only worked when he wanted or needed to work. And that's why he didn't have the work ethics or ambition that our culture expects from a talented film star. If Brando had contempt it was for Hollywood and it's pretentions, not for his craft. In the book, you'll find admiring and humble tributes to his mentors and fellow actors, including Stella Adler, Elia Kazan, Karl Malden, James Dean, Robert Duvall, and Kenneth Branagh. I'm glad Brando lived long enough to get old and fat, and that he didn't die tragically young like Marilyn, JFK, or Jimi Hendrix. I'm thankful for the films and words he did leave behind. This book reveals what a natural born trickster he was, his generous and tempestuous nature, how he was seeker of truth and a voluptuary. Brando was all this and more. I truely miss him. 
Before reading Songs My Mother Taught Me, I recommend printing out a copy of Brando's filmography from imdb.com and then watch as many of his films that you can find. This will help you enjoy the book, because Brando assumes the reader has watched the films he talks about. I watched most of his movies and became a fan. As many other reviewers stated, this book is an easy read. I felt as if he was in the room with me telling his story. Brando's life is a fascinating journey. His philosophy on various topics can leave the reader with mixed emotions. I left the book a lot more curious than I did going into it. I wonder if his facts about HUAC, Isreal, and the Native American are true. My future project is to seek out the information and decide for myself. Unlike many of today's celebrites, he doesn't come across as arrogant or pretentious. He had that reputation, but the book suggests otherwise. Brando is humble about his talent, his role in various causes he joined, and his place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actors. Any aspiring actor should read this book. Brando advocates the 'Method', which includes bringing your life experiences and incorporating them into the role you are playing. In the same breath, he tells the reader not to overresearch the role as he did at times. Later on in his career, he admits to 'winging it', because summoning up strong emotions are taxing when you get older. I respect his choice to leave his family and marriages out of his book. It really isn't necessary. I get the sense that his experiences with women haven't embittered him by the time he wrote the book, but he does admit to spending a large portion of his life as an angry man. Brando considering acting a means to an end. That's all. In his words, the hours are good, the pay great, and you only have to work three months out of the year. I respect the fact that he didn't get sucked into the whole 'Hollywood' scene. He explains why he refused the Best Actor Award for The Godfather. His reasons make perfect sense, even if you don't agree with them. I highly recommend this book. If you can find it new, buy it. It's worth the money. Brando's viewpoint isn't definitive, but you can get a better understanding of a man who in many ways is still a mystery. He's someone I would've like to have met. I envy people like Edward Norton and Johnny Depp, two actors around my age, who had a chance to work with him 
OK, so this book is a bit old now and I found it late. But- the advice is timeless and very useful. Unlike so many decorating books that are just filled with pictures of beautiful rooms in beautiful homes, this book gives you some basic principles so you can make your own stuff beautiful in your own home. Some of the decorating that I had already done in my home I really like, and this book tells me the principle behind what I did - why I like it. Some of the decorating I have done in my own home I don't like, and this book tells me what I can do to fix it. So, the mysteries of balance, alignment, furniture arrangement, displaying stuff, grouping pictures, etc are solved. My only problem with the book is the section on wall color. That was very brief and not very satisfactory, and she basically suggests that white walls are a good (safe) choice. There is no section on decorating color schemes either and that would be helpful. This is why I gave the book only 4 stars rather than 5 
For those who say this book is boring and has too many rules, I would ask: if all the 10,000 books out there full of glossy photos and little explanation were all that helpful, why did you need to buy this book in the first place? Decorating is like any other creative profession; the foundation of the "magic" that a good decorator can provide actually consists of basic principles that can be learned by anyone. Oh, and I think the reason some of the photos appear dated is that we are used to seeing design books incorporating the latest trends. She used photos of real homes, which, I'm sure, contained furniture that the owners had been collecting for years. That's kind of the point of this book. I love the books full of glossy color photos of dream rooms, and I'll continue to look at those for inspiration and ideas. But THIS book has made my home look better NOW 
No other book has ever shown us novice decorators how to light a room, arrange our art and furniture as well as this one. It is easy to follow and sticks to its promise that we do not have to buy all new furniture to make our home look really pretty. Anyone who would like to give their home an extreme makeover without throwing away what they already have will be truly amazed at what they can accomplish after reading Use What You Have Decorating 
The good: the author's room plans actually take into account furniture placement around windows and glass doors as well as entry points. Her examples show REAL homes with odd, mismatched furniture. Clear before and after pictures and floor plans, even if they are in black and white. She has some good rules of thumb to at least think of, which you may or may not agree with, and tends toward the neutral (white/beige) as far as paint--you can always add color with your choice of furnishings and art. She tells you which one should win out between beautiful view and fireplace when you have both in a room. The bad: Most of it is about living rooms, and she apparently assumes that you are doing a good deal of formal entertaining there. There are virtually no ideas for people who use their living rooms for anything else, e.g. home office, exercise room, playroom, etc. Not everyone entertains in their house--some have backyard BBQs, and others entertain at restaurants or the local park. Where I disagreed with her: If you have a library of books that you actually use, you would never organize them by size, you would organize them by subject/author, except of course for your truly oversized books. Pillows on sofas--hmmm. I think you can use them on futons or sofas with hard armrests, but on your typical overstuffed sofa, they're overkill. Would rather see a nice handmade afghan. To the critics who were upset that she "ignored" the TV: It is an etiquette thing, actually. The TV is not supposed to be more important than your guests, and she is by no means the only decorator who says to hide the TV in an armoire or better yet, put it in another room. These days a lot of the newer homes have dedicated "home theater" type rooms, anyway--with a less-expensive alternative being a spare bedroom. Besides, if you're having a Superbowl party or some such TV-related event, it would be smarter to have a TV in the kitchen/family room area where hopefully there is no carpet, and nothing furniture-wise that could be ruined by food. Bottom line: This book has a lot of useful ideas for furniture arranging, geared primarily to the living room and family room, but you can also use them as a jump-off point for rearranging other rooms. Some good ideas for some of the other rooms, like dining rooms you don't use because your kitchen is plenty big enough to eat in. I thought this book was much, much better than Decorating for Good by Carol Talbott 
Once in a while a book has a great impact on your life and Use What You Have Decorating is one of those books for me. My house looks like I brought in an expensive decorator but I did it myself just from what I learned by reading it. The title promises you can transform your home quickly and the results confirm that. Principles are shown in photos of real homes and the author makes it easy to understand what was wrong with the rooms and how the mistakes were corrected without buying furniture. What is most impressive is that the rooms in the book look totally different in one or two hours. It took me more than three hours to finish my living room and dining room with a little help from my better half and now both rooms look amazing. If you want to give your house a fast makeover look no further.  
This book was a huge dissapointment. Every single layout was the same. Arrange your sofa and loveseat facing each other, throw a crappy plant against the wall. The pictures were dated looking and in black and white. There is nothing this book has to offer that you cannot glean from watching 1 evening of HGTV 
If I could have given this book ten stars, I would have. Christopher Lowell and his Seven Layers of Design should have taken a page from Laurie Ward's excellent book which was practical, easy to read and sensible. The "before and after" pictures of a variety of rooms helped greatly. She was right -- in less than 1/2 hour, using her principles I transformed my crowded, awkwardly-arrange living room into a beautiful and stunning arrangement that encourages conversation and looks much larger at the same time. This book really helps in that the design principles are adaptable and applicable to any size room or home and really gives you concrete ideas to use in creating comfortable and beautifully arranged living spaces. Brava Laurie and thanks 
I haven't read all the 100+ reviews already written for this book, so my apologies if I point out things that have already been said. My favorite thing about this book is that it's straight-to-the-point and simple. Ward doesn't waste our time with unnecessary descriptions and adjectives (i.e. "...the velvety fabric drapes sumptuously over the chair adding a dramatic look"). Instead, she lists and explains the 10 design principles that most designers use (but don't tell us) in books and magazines. In cookbook-format, Ward focuses on topics such as placing furniture in a way that achieves balance and cohesiveness. Among other tips, she explains the rules for creating a focal point, minimizing a "rollercoaster" effect, arranging wall art, and displaying decorative objects and collections. Although, she mainly uses living room areas to explain her design principles, they can be applied to every room; but she also includes a few pages of tips for each room in the house. Photos of before-and-after rooms are presented in black white. I really think this was a great idea, because you can see the layout problems and solutions more clearly. I think that color photos would have taken away from that. For both Before and After rooms, a photo and floor plan of each are presented to show the differences. I also liked the little sidebar quizzes in which you look at the before photo and try to pick out the design problems. The furniture in the room examples may not be that appealing, but they DO look like furniture used in most typical middle-class homes. I like that because it makes the book seem so unpretentious. Ward doesn't give off that snobby designer impression; instead, she seems down-to-earth and in touch with those who don't live in mansions and spend $52,000 on a bed. I have to comment on one last thing: There's a small section for women on handling the "decorating-phobic" men in their lives. From her experience over the years, she has found that men tend to resist change and that as long as it's functional, they don't usually care what it looks like. So Ward has a little section titled "Here's What You Can Do", and then offers up a scheme to get your man to cooperate. I just think that was so funny and cute! Probably because I can relate. My husband has shirts in his closet from the 90's and REFUSES to part with them, then complains that he doesn't have enough closet space. Anyway... I don't give many books 5 stars, but it is well-deserved. I refer to it often and have about 18 sticky notes in it, along with the underlined and highlighted passages. I continue to buy the beautiful designer books and magazines for ideas and inspiration, but now (proudly) when I look at a photo I can see the design principles at work and how the "look" was achieved 
The Writer's Book of Hope, released in 2003, continues to be a beacon of hope to those on the long and tumultuous path to publication. Keyes gives anecdote after anecdote on writer's rejected who went on to become best-sellers. Excerpt: "Ursula Le Guin sent out her first story when she was eleven. She got her first acceptance at thirty-three. James Dickey endured years of form rejections before he finally saw hand-writing on one that said, "Not bad." According to James Lee Burke's agent, 100 editors turned down Lost Get-Back Boogie (including multipe editors at the same house) before Louisiana State University Press bought Burke's first novel for a pittance. It's a rare writer who doesn't have to hack through a jumble of rejection slips before (and after) getting published. Some of history's best-known books were rejected many times before finally being accepted. The Ginger Man, by J.P. Donleavy--now considered one of the best 100 novels ever published--was turned down by thirty-six publishers before it found a home..." Besides happy endings to rejected beginnings, Keyes takes us inside the world of publishing. Some of the Chapter titles: ~AFD Syndrome~ (before drinking hemlock) ~Dealing with Discouragers ~Rites of Rejection ~The Publishing Tribe (Why publishing Resembles High School) and more... This book is one of the few writing books I can't bring myself to give up. Every so often, I find myself discouraged beyond reason, and this book takes me back from the ledge of despair. It's a must read for any pre-pubbed writer needing an injection of optimism. REVIEWED ON: www.firstnoveljourney.blogpsot.com (author interviews, book reviews, and fiction related discussion 
Keyes does a great job presenting the case for finding hope in the writing process. This book specifically discusses: dealing with anxiety, frustration and despair, overcoming the discouragers in your life, exorcising excuses for not writing and pursuing a career in writing, the rites of rejection, the nature of publishers and editors, and how to keep hope alive. Years ago I had a basketball coach who taught "if you're not getting at least four fouls in a game, you're not playing defense." He didn't like fouls, but his point was, in the process of playing the game aggressively, fouls are going to happen. Fouls are not necessarily indicators of defeat, they are indicators of effort. Likewise, Keyes' approach to rejection is that all successful writers deal with rejection. In his book he provides numerous examples, including Nobel and Pulitzer prize winners, of authors who face rejection even after winning critical acclaim. Rejection is a fact of life, Keyes say, learn to deal with it. Easily stated, but it still hurts. According to Keyes, writers who have not experienced rejection are not sending out enough material; and, writers who don't learn to accept rejection as part of the writing process, are doomed to quit writing altogether. Keyes is the author of another book titled "The Courage to Write," which I highly recommend. Similar books by other authors which I would also recommend for the aspiring writer include: "On Becoming a Novelist," by John Gardner, and "The Forest for the Trees," by Betsy Lerner. Ron Atkins is the author of two children's books, Abby and the Bicycle Caper, and his upcoming (January 2005) Abby and the Bike Race Mystery. 
Every writer needs hope. And hope is what I always get when I read and reread Ralph Keyes's book, The Writer's Book of Hope. As an experienced, many times published writer, people might think I've got this writing profession figured out. But I don't. And on those days when I'm feeling lonely, dejected and sometimes rejected, I know I can turn to Keyes's book to help me realize I'm not alone in my insecurity and feeling of flakiness. There are days when I wonder if it isn't too late to go to plumbing school or enroll in the matchbook school of mosaic tiling. Writing does that too you. Plays games with your mind and confidence. But when those days creep up on me, I find solace in Hope. It makes my green skin turn less bright when I read John Grisham received twenty-some odd rejections and agents turned down JK Rowlings. Yet they persisted. And that, among other things is the difference between writers who stay the distance and those who let the publishing world get the better of them. Keyes has been there. He's one of us. He's not on a perch talking down to us wannabes. He's simply further in his journey than many of us. And that qualifies him as a leader. And the fact that he's willing to share the good, bad and ugly of this writer's world is generous. Reading the book is like sitting in an easy chair talking to a wise sage (with a little bit of mischief in his eyes) talking about the world of writing. Eyeball to eyeball. Writer to writer...friend to friend. And by doing so, Keyes offers us that thread that tethers writers together in this profession that is not for the faint of heart. And for that I'm grateful. Susan DeBow, writer 
Ralph Keyes' books about writing have helped pull my ambition out of a tail-spin twice. His first, The Courage To Write, helped me finish my first novel, which eventually got published. The follow-up to that, The Writer's Book Of Hope, helped me get started on my fourth book, at a point when I was beginning to feel frustrated with both the business of writing and the relentlessly demanding craft of it. What Keyes does in this book and in the first is to map out the tricky and sometimes dangerous emotional landscape of writing, and he does it by giving us examples and anecdotes from famous and sometimes legendary writers who've had similar frustrations. Better than practically any book on writing out there, The Writer's Book Of Hope offers those of us who spend our days in front of typewriters and computers making up worlds with words the boost we need to carry on. And Keyes does this not with some sugar-coated inspirational messages, but with honest, realistic and historical examinations of the traditional difficulties that all writers, regardless of their fame or lack or it, face and how they have coped and kept writing. Highly recommended 
Yes, I bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing.  First, I was first disappointed by the style of the author. The text rambled with anecdotes, that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter. Unfortunately, those chapters read like the earlier ones.  Second, I was surprised to find ninety-percent of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and not-so-famous authors. The anecdotes are depressing, not hopeful. Quite honestly, reading about hundreds of authors, each of who sounded like Job in their trials, was depressing. Given I wouldn't fancy myself as a future Grisham or Rowling or whatever, reading awful stories about how they almost didn't make it don't inspire hope.  Books I have enjoyed much more include Zinsser "On Writing Well," which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction; Stephen King's combination autobiography and how to, "On Writing"; and of course, keeping track of the guest columns in the New York Times on writing.. 
This book really opened my eyes to the reality of the publishing world. It also helped disapate a lot of anger and self pity I was feeling. Who knew you had to work this hard? Well, now I do. So it goes. I can now forge ahead without feeling so sorry for myself 
"I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves." Voltaire (1755 
This book had great practical advice for each stage in your child's reading life. Particularly helpful were the suggestions on overcoming difficult stages when children might tend to become apathetic towards reading. I also appreciated the emphasis on the total experience of reading, rather than the simple ability to identify words on a page. In addition I found it reassuring to hear that my husband's and my own enjoyment of reading will go a long way towards influencing our kid's desire to read 
I really enjoyed this book by Nora Roberts. It is set in the Carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer, IMHO. It has romance, treasure hunting, and a little magic....really great! I liked it alot 
This has got to be my all time favorite book...I could not put it down....I read it several years ago... The Scenery, mystery, romance all intertwined makes for a great novel. 
This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure. You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars! 
I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice. I loved the relationship between the two main characters. I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book. Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars 
With the chilly season setting in here in Washington State, the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long. I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there. This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader. This book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun. How exciting! The plot was wonderful, the characters were likable, the villians were nasty. This is one book that I am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat, and I will read it again when the cold starts setting in, so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure. 
I am fairly new to Nora Roberts. But this book is not only my favorite by her, it's one my favorite books altogether. It was so well written it made me feel like I were diving and hunting treasures myself! And it has such a sweet, romantic storyline. I was really sorry to see it end. I hope there will be a sequel. I recommend any woman to read this book, whether you like romance novels or not 
First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed. While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable. I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read. Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery. Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here. Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching. As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end. The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora. In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try! Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read 
I can't say enough good things about THE REEF! It shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men, and a strong sensitive male that isn't afraid to dream. This is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter and their families. The families run into each other while treasure-hunting for Angelique's Curse - a treasure that has eluded everyone, and many think it is only a myth. But this artifact is worth everything to some, even worth killing another. As this joint expedition continues, it holds all of the elements needed for a great story: mystery, romance, secrets that can't be shared, deceptions and threats. There are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader isn't sure which avenue Nora Roberts will take until she delivers them to it. This always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and gives you a first hand "view" of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue. I highly recommend THE REEF and only wish it would have continued - or at least had a sequel in the works! Great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning. One of Nora Roberts better works! 
I am a huge reader of history, and this is one of my favorites of all time. While full of interesting facts and stories, it is set apart from most books by the depth of the analysis it provides. It walks the line between history and social science, hinting at a theory of civilization and capitalism based on case studies from around the world. Though professional it is not dry (though I am infamous for enjoying a good dry book). My only criticism of it is the parts where it ventures into the cyclic theory of history. This is a European (or French) historiographic technique of trying to edition long recurring cycles. Frankly I find the concept forced (even more frankly, it's bunk!) and it always annoys me when I come across it...but it is part of the historical tradition Braudel was involved in, so it must simply be tolerated as a blemish on an otherwise stunning achievement 
Braudel was one of the greatest economic historians of all time. His scope alone was incredible. But what in the end hurt him and significantly diminished his findings was his unfamiliarity with the work of Harold Innis, whose landmark "Empire and Communications" was published a quarter century before Braudel published this book in the original French. Only Innis early work on the Canadian fur trade is referenced in Braudel's bibliographies. His later work on information in the creation of markets is not. Both looked at the economics of space and time, but what for Braudel ended in a series of uncertain conclusions ended for Innis in a profound theory of how the falling costs of information altered trade and communications patterns on a global scale. Put the two together and you have a clear picture of paradigm shifts over the centuries and an excellent framework for understanding outcomes in today's globalized economy 
Among the reviewers, I am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement. It is a mixture of facts and speculation, with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them. There is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded, and I have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be. In fact, this is a self-indulgent exercise in historical erudition. I don't care what anybody else says, this is a philosophy rather than history book. The author gives a lot of facts, but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts. The author tries to integrate almost everything under the Sun into this tome, and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information 
This book is a linear commentary on the little things in life. Each page and comment has a picture of an animal that adds meaning to the comment -almost always in a make you smile or outright laugh kind of way. It is a gentle and sensitive light hearted book that everyone will enjoy and gain something from. Of course it doesn't answer the big question, it just gives you food for thought about it. The only minus about this book is that all the pictures are in black and white. Color would have been so much better. 
I love this book. Everytime I read it I get something else from it. My kids like it to because of the great animal pictures. I have let co-workers borrow it and they had to buy their own. Wonderful for all ages 
Would recommend the book for anyone looking for a lightly thought provoking ideas 
We all have those cast-off generic "gift books" that lay around in some unused corner of our dwelling. You know, the books with children's letters to the tooth fairy, or little flowery poems about mothers. These books are hastily bought up from Hallmark stores and Walgreens each generic holiday and tossed in a gift bag with some half-rate chocolates and a crumy 99 cent card in our last-dash effort to conjure up a last-minute gift. These are usually obligatory gifts that we feel we have to give, even though we may really love and care about the recipient and feel like a jerk because we can't think of something else, at the last minute, to gift them with on our way to Aunt Helga's family reunion, late as usual. Two days later, your gift book finds its self laying with other passed-on rejects at the inventory check-in counter of your local used bookstore while the clerk groans to see yet another gifty bound volume of mushy valentines prose. Being continuously re-gifted is the career of these books until some kind soul mercifully chucks them to the trash heap with a mighty swing of disgusted zeal. I used to be there. I was on both ends, a shameful purchaser of these thankless books, and also a silently groaning recipient of the book world's version of fruit cake. Then one day upon the tank of my toilet, I find this green little hardback, The Meaning of Life, laying unassumingly on the barren porcelain turf. Knowing my mother must have left it hoping I would take a moment from my workaholic life to indulge in a book, I did just that. Is it awfully cheesy to say that this little book touched me most profoundly? I sat, reading page by page, and simply breathed in the peace and stillness of just a few moments of my otherwise rigorous day. The simple words in uncluttered typeset reached my heart and soul as profoundly soothing. Roll your eyes if you want, but I've read this book uncountable times since, in both times of sorrow and joy, and it has continued to have the same result on me. Of course, the humor of these books also deserves to have a comment. Both the text and the unique photos on each page spread, will make even the most hardened grump crack a grin. A few years later and it still rests on the same spot my knowing mother left it, however, now it lives in a simple basket joined with Bradley Trevor Greive's other witty, heartfelt volumes, each a work in its own. Do yourself a favor...break the fruit-cake-gift-book syndrome and gift your love one with this true jewel of a treasure. Aunt Helga will thank you 
This book is a cute/light-hearted flip book that does not take itself too seriously. I highly recommend it. As far as the detractors on this website go, a self-proclaimed "doctor" believes that books like this are the cause of society's evils. "WHy there is so many deadbeat dads" It must be difficult for a doctor to graduate with a degree considering he can neither use proper grammer or style when writing a sentence my seven year old son could do effortlessly. People can be mean spirited, even about light hearted books like this one, don't listen to them 
I first noticed this book in a Hallmark store, bought it to give to someone, and read it myself first. The photos are top quality shots mostly of animals mimicking various human emotions and situations. They are the light side of the book. The text is more weighty, but brief - I'd even call it profound. Put together, they give the reader a fun, yet meaningful reading experience that makes an impact. I've since purchased additional copies for gifts 
As someone who always says I am looking for the Meaning of Life, this title caught my eye (even though I didn't think it actually contained the answer). It does tell you that you need to find your own meaning (guess I knew that) but the quotes are SO true and the pictures SO cute, I thoroughly enjoyed them and they give me the message that I am on the right path. I look forward to the day when "I'll be excited about beginning another day and be filled with heartfelt joy." Sounds great to me! I you are interested in this topic I would highly recommend Finding Your Own North Star: Claiming the Life You Were Meant to Live by MARTHA BECK. Good Luck on your search.  
I really enjoyed the counterpoint of these beautiful and sometimes humorous black and white animal photographs 
I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it. I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away. He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way. The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures. It did have one thought that I really liked: "Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge. If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly? 
A simple, predictable, yet powerful story of an old-school pitcher, Shaara's novel is a classic baseball tale. Billy Chapel, a future Hall-of-Famer who has just learned of his trade after 17 years with the same club, decides to hang up his cleats rather than leave the team he loves. He is not interested in money (yes, this is an obvious work of fiction), and pitches primarily for his "love of the game." Shaara provides a unique formula for story-telling, as he interweaves flashbacks of Billy's life into his final game on the mound. In it, Shaara shows the total concentration and focused mind of an all-time great pitcher as he progresses through his last effort as a ballplayer. Through flashbacks, we learn of Billy's past relationships with his parents and his girl, Carol. And during the game, Shaara provides simple, direct descriptions of the events, in an nearly non-emotional, detached tone. Indeed, Shaara allows us to delve into the mind of a pitcher as he pitches a perfect game (although he doesn't even realize this until the 8th inning). And, yet, the primary focus is not baseball, but his retrospect on his life and his place in the world. Although this book may have been more polished if Shaara hadn't died suddenly, this is still a superb book and a classic "old-school" baseball tale. For baseball purists and baseball lovers alike, this should be on the short-list of any reading list. And even for non-baseball fans, this is still a compelling story 
I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan. The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher. It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot. The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories. The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there. Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work. Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees. Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear. The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season. Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field. This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels." It's unfortunate. There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
Heard FOR LOVE OF THE GAME by Michael Sahara, a posthumously published baseball novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author of THE KILLING ANGELS . . . you might have to dig some to find it, but your search will be worth the effort. This is a short, surprisingly moving tale of an aging baseball superstar who is pitching the last game of the season . . . through a series of flashbacks, you learn about his career and the one woman he loves (but who is leaving him). The writing is compelling, and it makes you feel that you really get to know the guy . . . plus, it has you rooting for his every pitch and caring about what happens to him. There's a great ending, too. 
Don't get me wrong this was a really good book. And I am so close to giving it 5 stars. It was just a little too short for me. The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core. The only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game. You will fly through this book, it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it, even after that mild short coming I mentioned. Just my opnion, I could be wrong 
This book was eye opening for me to apply personalities and personal relationships between Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton and of course Adams among others. The vibrant times of enlightened thought in the formation of the country with the Declaration of Independence then in the midst of war and politics and thereafter the early years of forming the Constitution and the political infighting was very interesting. These were passionate men who lived in an incedible time. I never had seen these founding fathers as real people before this book. I recommend this read. 
I purchased this audiobook for my husband, who listens to books while he works. He never watches movies a second time and he never listens to books twice. But after checking this out from the library, he talked about this book so much he ended up checking it again. He continued to fill me in on the life story of John Adams and told me several times that he wouldn't mind owning this one! Needless to say, he made it easy for me to decide on an anniversary gift this year and he couldn't have been happier 
I decided to read this book after enjoying "1776." I was instantly enthralled by the life of John Adams. McCollough is such an interesting writer and this book has been thoroughly researched. I became quite connected to John Adams during my reading, and I was moved to tears at several points in the book. I knew so little about him before reading this biography, but when I completed this book I felt like I had lost a dear friend. In addition to his personal life, the reader will learn more about the Continental Congress, The Declaration of Independance, the forming of the U.S. government, early U.S. foreign relations, and of course all of the interesting men and women who lived during the early years of the formation of the new country. This is a wonderful, compelling read 
The book biggest strength is that it uses many quotations of John Adams, Abigail, John Quincy Adams, and Jefferson to tell its tale. These people were intelligent and very good writers. I enjoyed the biography. I enjoyed McCullough's writing style and the leisurely pace he sets for himself. The biography clearly portrays a man who lived long, did many great things, and died at peace with himself. The book glosses over Adams' weaknesses and I thought spent way too much time on what Jefferson and Adams thought of each other, but these are minor flaws. I enjoyed Morris's biography of Roosevelt more, but this book was a good summer read and was far better than McCullough's 1776. I learned how this nation owes a great debt to this great, but flawed man. 
Like another reviewer, my interest in history is quite new. The author's presentation of John Adams left me wanting to know much more of this great man. David McCullough's excerpting of Adams' professional and personal writings exposed a passionate man of deep convictions and possessed of an intellect and idealism beyond his generation. While Mr. Adams was acutely aware of and deplored his own ego, he, at the same time was critical of his own limitations. Even with this conflict, Adams could still say, "I thank God that he gave me stubborness when I am right." While I read history for breadth of understanding and perspective; learning the character, strengths, weaknesses and foibles of great men and women who accomplished much during their time on the stage challenges me to dare more and risk more in the time and place God has entrusted to me. I would very much liked to have met John Adams 
First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books). I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin. All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
This book isn't really for legal scholars, serious historians or those interested in Adams' writings. It is, however, a very well written personal biography of a great figure in American history with a special emphasis on trying to understand the hows and whys of Adams, how he responded to criticism, how he came to conclusions, why he made the decisions he came to etc...It is difficult to provide enough color sometimes when presenting such a 'long' life and McCullough I am sure had difficulty deciding when to slow the narrative to dwell on important events when there were so many to choose from. All and all, a very solid, thoughtful mainstream work. 
What a fantastic way to learn about John Adams! What a great way to be introduced to excellent historical biographical writing! McCullough is a brilliant and exciting writer. He truly makes Adams come alive, and when Adams inevitably dies at the end it is a very sad thing! Adams is truly a hero of the Republic. A great friend, then a great rival, then a great friend again of Thomas Jefferson, Adams is undeservedly overlooked by many students of American History. Adams the republican vs Jefferson the populist was the great debate in American history and still continues today. Adams saw the horror of the French Revolution for what it was and predicted that it would end in depravity and violence and likely cause a savage reaction which would bring about the end of the French Republic itself. He was right, Bonaparte quickly followed the French Revolution and war across europe was the result. Jefferson on the other hand embraced the French Revolution as an expression of the people's desire for liberty. How wrong he was! Adams was a brilliant Statesman, and student of history. A wonderful family man and superb husband Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail is a classic in American literature. As a youth I spent many hours on the grounds of the Adams Mansion soaking up all the history there as much as is possible. McCullough does so well what so many biographers do so poorly and that is he captures the times of the subject and places the person in his rightful context. He brought me back to the grounds of "Peacefield" through his beautiful evocations of it as it hosted great people and great events. History is best studied by understanding how historical figures lived and understood their own lives and times, as they lived them. Hindsight is an overrated tool in historiography. Bringing the past to life in writing is a special gift and McCullough has it. Enjoy his talents and get to know the foundations of the American nation a story that is not fully known by so many. Adams' story deserves to be told. What a brilliant man, and McCullough does him superb justice in this highly readable biography. So much can be said here about Adams, but it's not necessary as McCullough has written the definitive John Adams biography and says it better than I. Get to know John Adams through this superb book, you will be glad that you did. And your opinions on Jefferson will likely change, too! 10 STARS! 
As a newer student of history I'm fascinated by all of the research and reconstruction that goes into putting together biographies of some of our early leaders. This book is no exception. The story at times becomes a little bogged down in details that can distract, but overall the reading is easy and the content stays with the reader 
Simply outstanding. McCullough brings history alive. It's not "history," it's a real story. It may not be perfect historically, but it's pretty darn good. And there is no such thing as "perfect" anyway when it comes to history. It is perfect, however, when it comes to conveying - it's vivid, it's fully understandable, it's exciting, and it's not hyped because history at that period of time and the life and role of Adams was so exciting. I love it. I love it. I love it 
I wonder if the creators of that operating system had this book, would anyone know of Bill Gates or Microsoft; or if Xerox held its research and development of the paperless office, would the Information Technology field be totally different- yeah you know where I am going with this. If you are a creative mind searching for a way to protect your hard work and development, GET THIS BOOK for it is a sound minded investment for your greatest assets: ideas that move the world and generate money. This book explained all the types of Creative Assets Protection out there. Granted it does not read as the other Rich Dad books, not as personal, but its lessons and information are vital not only to understand various intellectual properties, but also to seeking the best legal representation in both the physical and cyberspace. 
I think I know how this book was written. A whole lot of cut and paste from U.S. Law code with some mediocre story telling sprinkled in. If you want to be technical and write in the language of professional law, fine. But this is not the series to do it in. 
Unlike the rest of the Rich Dad books that I've read -- which were for the most part fantastic -- this book was terrible. Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer. The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book. Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me. And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical "horror stories" that he relays at the beginning of the book. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down. But I guess I could've gotten that from a dictionary too 
Micheal Lechter has done us all a valuable favor by writing this book! As an experienced attorney dealing with copyrights, patents, and trademarks, his experience, illustrations and insights are priceless! If you are a business owner, investor, inventor, author, or doing just about ANYTHING that has income potential beyond a 9-5 job, then you NEED to read, absorb and apply the knowledge of this book to protect yourself from the competition and "thieves" out there who would like to profit from your intellectual property--at YOUR expense. This is a "must read" as a part of your overall business and investment education. I also recommend ALL of Robert Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad" books, and thus far, all the "Rich Dad Advisor" series that I have read (of which this book is a part) are also worthy of your time and investment 
I hear Michael on CNET Radio on Online Tonight with David Lawrence. I've just finished reading "Protecting Your #1 Assets" and was really happy to get it. It was filled with answers and it really helped give me focus for goals I had at the office. In particular, it hit home in regards to the importance of protection. This is not an easy subject to find good information about - Michaels book really made it much easier for me to learn what to do and how to avoid some of the nightmares I was almost ready to discover first hand 
I read the book and thought it was an excellent primer in intellectual property law. I also spoke to a friend of mine who works in a large law firm (100+) attorneys in Milwaukee. He told me that the attorneys in the IP department in this prestigious firm use this book as a reference. I think that speaks quite highly of the book. I strongly recommend it 
Although I have found Robert Kiyosaki's books to be excellent, I am SO unimpressed, bored, and resentful of this book. Basically, it is almost 300 pages of this phrase right here: "Get professional help". There- done. You have now read the book. I agree with many of the other reviews here, in that it really isn't helpful to someone interested in protecting their ideas, but only helpful to Kiyosaki and the author. This is an "Advisor" series book, and it has made me skeptical of the rest of them. Sales Dogs is also not helpful unless you are already experienced in sales 
This is my wifes rating since she finished the book and I have only started.So far ,I agree.It's another completely different area of the country which make her books so interesting 
I've been tearing through Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon mysteries ever since I discovered them. The tighest and best story in my opinion is Firestorm - this one was a little harder to follow and I'm not sure I ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery. But like with all the Pigeon novels, the characters and physical setting were interesting and well-drawn, and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing, such as the relationship between Anna and her sister, and the relationship between Anna and Frederick the FBI agent (be prepared to be surprised!) I don't think I'm going to read anything else until I've finished all the Anna Pigeon books out there - on to Blind Descent! 
This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down. It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest. There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime. There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable. I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction. Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
I love listening to this book as Cindy Williams has an enjoyable voice and does a good job reading. The story is enjoyable as well but it is so changed from the book at times it bares little resembelence to it. I am not referring to the fact it is abridged and much is left out. I refer to the fact for example that a character that is a man in the book is a WOMAN on the tape. Such changes alter the structure of the story and make it into a DIFFERENT story than the one you expect to hear. If you have not read the book this is a moot point but if you have your in for some surprises 
Anna is in the south again - but this time on one of the islands off the coast of Georgia. And she's not 'wrastlin' gators this time, it's turtles instead. There's a plane crash, Bambi (real name, Flicka), cannibus (marijuana), and more. She's still contemplating moving to Chicago to be with the distant Frederick, but that possibility seems to always be on the backburner. As usual, Nevada fights the good fight, goes skinny dipping, gets her hair cut, and is finally free of her ex-husband (in a hilarious manner), while discovering the the secrets of Cumberland Island's murders 
I was not familiar with Thomas Friedman's New York Times columns. This book contains a sampling of his columns. The book mainly portrays the difference in the Arab vs. the culture of the West. The book opens with the shock of the events of 9/11, considered a tragedy by the West and a cause for celebration for many places in the Arab and Muslim world. The author goes onto explain the Arab world's rage against America is the result of the idea that America represents, globalization , modernity, plurality. Muslim populations in the middle east are generally ruled by oppressive regimes that are failing their populace, providing a limited world vision, while censoring information. The author made an interesting observation, India has the second largest Muslim population of any country in the world, but the Muslim rage in not present, as the author notes, chanting "death to America" is not the favored occupation of its populace. The reason, India is a democracy, the people are concerned with bettering themselves through government. And so it goes, The author's main point is that when the Middle East can be democratized, and the poverty alleviated it will be ready to join the modern world. I really believe Tom Freidman is right on target with the ideas within this book. 
Friedman's writing is consistently thoughtful, and this book is no exception. I appreciate deeply the care with which this book has been prepared. It belongs in every thinking person's library 
Thomas Friedman's "Longitudes and Attitudes" is a very readable book based on a collection of columns he wrote for the New York Times just before the attacks of 9/11 and for the year following those attacks. The last quarter of the book contains a kind of diary in which he attempts to put into context where he was in the world when he wrote these columns and how he was personally feeling at the time. It is a very personal collection, often invoking the image of his children's future. Friedman's primary mission, as he relates it in meetings with educated people across the Middle East, is his search for the rationale of the terrorists, why they killed, and how they were radicalized. He frequently relates how depressed he got when talking to educated Middle Easterners who unflinchingly believed in conspiracy theories of the highest order. The most common canard he constantly ran across was that four thousand Jews were notified on the morning of 9/11 not to go to the World Trade Towers. Another astonishing "fact" he constantly confronted from academics, clerics and the media in the Middle East was that there is no proof that Muslims were the 9/11 hijackers in the first place. In general, Friedman relates, most Muslims in the Middle East also believe that the attack was a plot by the CIA (or Jews) to discredit Muslims and that all the American media is run by Jews. Throughout the book, Friedman does not shy away from the fact that he is Jewish. He is balanced and critical of both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - decrying the brutality of the Israelis and Palestinians and he especially singles out the stubbornness of Arafat in that Arab leader's failure to accept the Clinton peace plan, which would have given Palestinians a state encompassing 95% of what they asked for and could have stanched the bloodshed. Friedman relates his amazement that the Middle East is bombarded by an incessant 24-hour-a-day attack in the Arab media upon Israel and the United States, particularly via TV programs that run through the night simply playing martial music and showing images of Israeli brutality against Palestinians - which is always portrayed as one-sided. He is unabashedly and constantly critical of the Saudi Arabia regime, from which, we are frequently reminded, was home to 15 of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers. Friedman seems particularly upset that Saudi Arabia did not apologize for the involvement of its nationals in the attack against the US and has refused to cooperate with the FBI in their investigation. He also makes it abundantly clear that Saudi Arabia, along with Iran, seem to be in a race to provide money to Islamic madras's across the globe that teach virulent intolerance and hatred against America and Israel. Friedman doesn't simpy rail against the world as he sees it, he does prescribe some remedies for what he refers to as an ongoing "Clash of Civilizations," a term he borrows from Samuel Huntington. If we don't address the tumult we find ourselves in and Usama bin Laden "wins," Friedman warns us that, "The war of civilizations will be coming to a theater near to you." First and foremost, he calls upon Arab nations to forge a new future for their citizens by letting go of the past and looking to the future. Too often Arab nations and leaders deflect true change by blaming all their troubles on someone else... their problems are America's fault, or Bush's fault, or Israel's fault and so on ad infinitum. True leaders in the Middle East should create plans for the future, not just laying blame for present and past real and perceived slights. Arab leaders should come up with plans for educating their children, making governments more responsive and creating jobs for the exploding number of young people in the Middle East. Friedman goads Arab leaders by saying things such as, while other emerging nations "make microchips, you are making potato chips," and that the GDP of Spain is greater than that of all 22 Arab states combined. Friedman could be called a liberal hawk. He firmly believes in globalization, with a caveat that the Internet can be "an open sewer." He also believes that the concept of engaging and talking with your enemy is the only way that problems can truly be resolved. An example: The U.S. and Israel engaged Arafat and came up with a plan that gave the Palestinians a state encompassing 95% of what they wanted. This pleased Friedman the liberal. Arafat torched the olive branch that was extended to him and Friedman the hawk reminds us that Arafat had many maps that did not even show modern Israel on them. Friedman the hawk also applauded the fall of Saddam from a humanitarian viewpoint (reminding us that Saddam killed more Muslims in the 20th century than any other individual) and asked his readers to "give the CIA a break," and "give war a chance." One of the most important ideas this book relates is that, unlike Christianity and the Jewish faith, Islam never went though Enlightenment or a Reformation. What this means is that Islam never separated church and state the way that the West has done and therefore Islam has not been able to move its society and culture forward because of the constant influence of clerics who can't effectively run a modern nation. Lastly, the last quarter of the book that was written in a diary format was primarily a rehash of ideas spelled out earlier in the book - merely reformatted to fit the geographic contours of where and when Friedman wrote his columns. This part of the book added little new information and seemed that it was almost an afterthought... an awkward attempt to tie together all the canned columns. 
This book is a collection of newspaper columns and journal entries that Friedman wrote before and after the September 11th attacks. Friedman is very familiar with the Middle East, having been a news correspondent in Beirut and Jerusalem for ten years before becoming foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times. Although he himself had stressed that one consequence of globalization has been the creation of super-empowered individuals with a grudge against the United States, and that bin Laden was just such an individual (The Lexus and the Olive Tree), even Friedman did not see it coming on September 11th, 2001. This book features reprints of Friedman's columns analyzing the reasons why the September 11th attacks happened, and the reaction in the following months throughout the Islamic world. The book also includes a short journal section, in which Friedman describes his travels in the Middle East while he was collecting material for his columns. The events of September 11th 2001 found me and my husband in a Lebanese restaurant in the Dubai neighborhood where we had been living for four years. The waiters were listening to the radio, and from all the cheers and excitement, we thought some Arab country was winning a World Cup soccer match against a European powerhouse. But the waiters wouldn't look at us. Finally one came over and with a face that alternated between embarrassment, concern, and glee, told us something big had happened in the U.S. We went home immediately to check the news on CNN. The following day, Western-educated Arab colleagues would give us their condolences, but not long afterwards, every one of them told us they believed the CIA and Mossad were behind the attacks, and that no Arabs were involved. Bin Laden's face appeared on the wallpaper of my Emirati students' computers and cell phones-for them he was clearly a hero, not a demon. In seeking to understand the events, I read the newspaper daily, and was amazed that Friedman, with a New York byline, could be so well informed about what we were seeing all around us. While I don't agree with everything that Friedman espouses in this book, I think his analysis of the Muslim world following September 11th is about as accurate as any Western journalist could develop. Friedman is a fierce patriot, for all the right reasons. He lived overseas long enough to appreciate the qualities that make America great. He reminds us that "American power and wealth flow directly from a deep spiritual source-a spirit of respect for the individual, a spirit of tolerance for differences of faith or politics, a respect for freedom of thought as the necessary foundation for all creativity, and a spirit of unity that encompasses all kinds of differences...Lord knows, ours is hardly a perfect country. Many times we have deviated from the American spirit or applied it selfishly. But it is because we come back to this spirit more times than not, in more communities than not, that our country remains both strong and renewable." Friedman notes, "It will be a tragedy if Arabs and Muslims adopt the position that there is no conceivable reason why Americans might be upset with them today and that any criticism they face in the U.S. media is entirely the result of some Jewish campaign of vilification....Whenever a people reduces all its problems to a conspiracy by someone else, it absolves itself and its leaders of any responsibility for its predicament-and any need for self-examination... No civilization has ever prospered with that approach...Only in a society that embraces self-criticism can the political process produce real facts to cope with real problems....The standard view of America in the Arab-Muslim world is that America is rich and powerful because it is crass and materialistic...The truth is exactly the opposite. America is successful and wealthy because of its values, not despite them. It is prosperous because of the way it respects freedom, individualism, and women's rights and the way it nurtures creativity and experimentation." According to Friedman, although Arabs will point to US support for Israel as the reason behind the anger against the US, the real reasons for Arab anger come down to stagnating domestic Arab economies and hard-line autocratic governments which permit anger to be expressed only about the occupation of Palestine. He notes how governments support hate-mongering imams, and how the Arabic media presents images of Israeli violence unceasingly on television. Thus, even those who are not drawn to religious institutions are kept perpetually angry, but their anger is safely diverted from domestic issues. In an October, 2001 column, Friedman points out "Since September 11, the President of the United States has given several speeches about how Islam is a tolerant religion, with no core hostility to the West. But the leader of Saudi Arabia, the keeper of the Muslim holy places, hasn't given one." In trying to understand the deeper message of 9/11, Friedman writes "while the world is being globalized, shrunk, and tied together ever more closely in technological terms, this has not been accompanied by a better mutual understanding between cultures, countries and civilizations. There is a mismatch. We are technologically closer-and culturally and politically as far apart as ever, at least among certain communities." In one of my favorite columns of the book, "Changing the Channel," Friedman presents a tongue-in-cheek analysis of why watching the Golf Channel is a lot more fun than watching the news from the Middle East. When I returned home from the Middle East myself, my first inclination was to wall myself off from news about the region because it made me angry. But Friedman argues this is counter-productive. "In the long term, the only answer is to figure out ways to change the attitudes and intentions of the people on the other side of the wall, or at least narrow the gap between differing cultures and political traditions so we can share this shrinking planet." That's a challenging undertaking 
I remember back in the day when I was a blind follower of Michael Moore and Al Franken thinking that Tom Friedman was some right wing jerk. For no real reason either, he just seemed to fit that mold to an extremely naive liberal. It certainly makes me uncomfortable to think back to those days, because I am now a pragmatic and realistic moderate and I certainly had Friedman pegged wrong (and also because I now realize Moore and Franken are mostly useless). Longitudes and Attitudes is a collection of Friedman's New York Times columns from 9/11/01 to 4/20/03 plus a short travel diary at the end that takes some of the stories from the columns and fleshes them out a bit to provide more details and context. The book's format makes it amazingly easy to read and Friedman's writing style is superb. He does a fantastic job at communicating his ideas in an easy to understand fashion. I didn't agree with everything he said in these columns, but he really made me think about what I thought about certain issues. I think that's the sign of a great writer and analyst. Especially when I think of the subject matter he writes about, I'm glad someone like Friedman is out there because I really do think that if more people in America read his books and columns with an open mind, this country would be better off for it. My only real complaint that I feel warranted mentioning here is that Friedman hinted several times at the lack of Muslim response to 9/11, as if there were no Muslims that condemned the attacks. I'm sure Friedman talked to a great many people all over the world, but there were quite a few Muslim sources of outrage and condemnation after 9/11. I wish he would have perhaps looked a little harder to find them. I think this would be a great book for anyone even remotely interested about terrorism, foreign policy, etc. to read. I certainly plan on reading the rest of his books and look forward to what he will produce in the future 
When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times. I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments. Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together. If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first. It is by far his best 
Tom Friedman is a engaging writer. He also writes from a very personal perspective, both as to how the world has changed for him and his family, and for his friends around the world. You get the feeling that Mr. Friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching. What a treat and a very easy read. Pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the US shores 
Tom Friedman has a regular column in the new york times. I have always loved his columns and this book is excellent (It is actually a collection of his NY Times columns). A must read for anyone who is interested in politics in the middle east, terrorism and its origin and the iraq war 
Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on 
may not make you wise. My immediate response right after finishing the last page of this book: Had the author published a new book after this? To my very disappointment, the answer is negative. I am a Chinese living in Hong Kong who knew very little about the Middle East beforehand. This book is really an eye opener to me. I couldnt imagine that in 2002, "There are now 84,000 prostitutes operating on the streets of Tehran and 250 brothels, ... 60 new runaway girls hitting Tehran's streets everyday...Forty percent of all drug addicted women in Iranian prisons have AIDS...Unemployment which is already around 30 percent) is steadily rising." pg 280 Of course this book is not about showing bad looking statistics from credible Middle East sources. It preached viable solutions that Bush had not adopted. To name a few: "Frankly, I hope Saddam disappears tomorrow. But even if he does, that's not going to solve our problem. Saddam is a conventional threat who can be eliminated by conventional means. He inspires no one. The idea people who inspired the hijackers are religious leaders, pseudo-intellectuals, pundits and educators, primiarily in Eygpt and in Saudia Arabia, which continues to use its vast oil wealth to spread its austere and intolerant brand of Islam, Wahabism. June 2002." Pg 265 and "If we've learned one thing since 9/11, it's that terrorism is not produced by the poverty of money. It's produced by the poverity of dignity. It is about young middle class Arabs and Muslims feeling trapped in countries with too few good jobs and too few opportunities to realize their potential or shape their own future - and blaming America for it. We have to break the cycle...June 2002." Pg 270 To counter the pro American impression from the examples I quoted above, "This is not to say that US policy is blameless. We do bad things sometimes. But why is it that only Muslims react to our bad policies with suicidal terrorism, not Mexians or Chinese? Is it because ...Jews could not be so strong on their own...the United States created and supports Israel? Mar 2002" Pg 197 and "Mr. Bush has repeatedly told the world: If you're not with us, you're against us. He needs to remember this: The rest of the world is saying the same thing to us. March 2002" Pg 207 In short, a well written book of wisdom. It's ideas are really true, useful and can pass the test of time, especially after the bombings in London last Thursday. Dont miss it. 
Written in the context of the Cold War, the author emphasizes the need for free markets and an open society for a society to property function. It stresses the importance of the individual and the needs of the individual against the backdrop of an "ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country" era and the basic economic honesty of selfishness in general. There are several ideas in the book that probably need to be revisited (which is why you should read it) since they are becoming issues again in today's world. 
An all-time favorite of mine, Capitalism Freedom creates a framework of classic liberalism and argues forcefully in favor of free-markets and decentralization over the expansion of government involvement in economic and social affairs. Friedman builds his argument from the ground up by identifying coercion as the State's distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations. From the (classic) liberal's perspective, this aspect shapes the relationship between citizen and government, and strictly limits the appropriateness of State involvement in society, particularly with regard to well-intentioned programs and policy.  Friedman uses this foundation to build a case for limited government in economic matters, citing in particular the consequences of monetary and fiscal policy abuse. In an exceptionally apt comparison, Friedman argues that the same rationale that limits government interference with free speech should likewise apply to government interference in the economy: namely, that constraints be applied to monetary and fiscal policy to limit the potential for government to do harm in its pursuit of doing good. Friedman gives numerous examples in which government officials, exercising carte-blanche economic authority, have further aggravated economic crises by applying a case-by-case standardh to different economic scenarios. Having clearly laid out his political philosophy, Friedman builds his case for free-markets, detailing control measures intrinsic of a laissez-faire economy. From floating exchange rates to voucher-funded schooling, union contracts to charity, Friedman argues that the free-market harnesses the productive potential of millions of individuals and corporations, reconciling their preferences in a competitive process far more efficiently than any collective body. Throughout the book, Friedman debunks popular myths, disputes misunderstandings, and challenges the conventional wisdom prevalent among intellectuals and social elites of his day and ours. The book's only drawback is its age and somewhat antiquated writing style that would certainly make it difficult for some readers to fully understand (particularly those who are victims of public school "education"). Friedman references several examples that would have been more easily recognized in the 1960s, but will not be immediately familiar to younger readers. Still, this brilliant work presents the core principles of laissez-faire capitalism and classic liberalism in a relatively clear manner, and is a must-read for anyone studying the dynamics of free-markets and free societies 
This book probably should not be treated as "capitalist manifesto" a la Marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous Galbraith "The Affluent Society" (1958). Reading the book without reading Galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) style. But as a polemic with Galbraith vision of post-capitalism (post-industrial society) the book looks like an interesting historical document. In his book Galbraith stressed that to become successful, post-WWII America should invest heavily in infrastructure (highways, phone infrastructure, etc) as well as education using funds from general taxation and government intervention. At the same time he felt that the government power should be balanced against the power of capitalists using some countervailing forces (he mistakenly assumed that unions can play such a role). He also noted that large companies are actually exempted from competition on a national level because they are closely linked with the state and competition is limited to small companies (and most of their profits are expropriated by banks, landlords and state). In essence he argued that the USA society is no longer a capitalist society but some different dualistic social organization that combines elements of socialism (planning) for the largest firms and government (macroeconomics) with limited "free market" capitalism for small fish (microeconomics). Many argues that GM troubles proved that Galbraith was wrong. But if you look at GM problems it's clear that it was not national competitors who squeezed Detroit. Friedman definitly was the most intellectually astute opponent of Galbraith post-industrial society vision. He pointed out that the great virtue of the market is that it enables people who hate each other to cooperate economically. But most of the content of the book is detached from reality and looks like a draft of yet another utopia. Sometimes the level of radicalism of this advocate of "free market" suggests that he is closer to socialists (especially Trotskyites) then conservatives and from defender of "status quo" turned into promoter of a new and dangerous social utopia, a new economic messiah who preached that free market + fiat money used with a specific rule of money stock expansion (3-5% per year ) will save mankind. Freidman's libertarian-style absolutization of the market ("In Goldman Sacks we trust" using Galbraith catch phase) as well as advocacy of fiat money (he played a role in the USA unilateral withdrawal from gold standard) in a way makes Friedman's views very similar to Marxists (extremes meet), although his utopia proved to be definitly less costly for mankind. It's funny that the latest administration that proclaims "market, markets" and praise Friedman actually behaves more like "Military Keynesians" then "free market" advocates. The same was true for Reagan. Still it was during Reagan's years when conservatism had grown into more and more dangerously utopian social vision ready for dangerous experiments with society. Freidman's arguments that planning is unnecessary and that market forces have built-in checks and balances and can do wonders if they are freed from any and all government intervention can be understood seriously only in context of polemics with the representative of the opposite extreme views (statists). For readers in 2006 and especially European readers it's clear that Friedman's views of the market are anti-historic and "free market" described in the book never existed and probably will never exist in human history. Market never exists in vacuum and always is intrinsically connected and always experience significant level of control by the government (level greater then roles of an arbiter of disputes and the provider of the currency presuppose). The opposite is also true and market tend to influence government in many ways, especially dangerous if there are large national firms which depends by-and-large on government contracts (military industrial complex). Some proposed in his book "solutions" like eliminating medical profession licensing in the name of free market are pretty bizarre. It looks like the main problem with Friedman's book is that unlike Galbraith he did not understand the importance of balancing government power with the freedom for market forces. Extreme positions that proclaim advantage of a single social force always look extremely dangerous. For example if everything is just a "free market" why buying politicians should be prohibited ? Is not this a discrimination against free market? (the same question is applicable to judiciary). What about the danger of natural creation of heredary elite by market forces and resulting "natural" conversion of parliamentary democracy into oligarchy (like "Iron law of oligarchy" presuppose) ? Failing to address those problems makes his book mostly irrelevant for the reader in 2006, but still important as a historical document that criticized Galbraith views (it was Galbraith who coined the term "countervailing power".) Today we face the fundamental question: at which point "laissez-faire" capitalism/"unrestricted market" and associated with it corruption of government should be stopped (and some too hot and/or crooked practitioners probably jailed) and where and when unchecked state powers expansion should be stopped (preferably with similar type of punishment) to prevent sliding of society into also stagnant and completely corrupt version of "well developed socialism, Brezhnev's style." Society probably needs to deal with the market the way tennis players deal with tennis racket: if player holds it too tightly his game suffer, but is he/she holds it too loose he cannot play well either. In this respect "former socialist countries" were not so much socialist (the famous joke in the USSR was that any "capitalist" European country contains more communists then the whole USSR) but countries with too powerful and unbalanced by any other forces government. And it was probably the internally grown oligarchy and not initiated by Reagan arm race (" military keysianism") that eventually defeated communist party control of the state, the oligarchy the was naturally created by the state after WWII and consisted to a large extent of party members in high positions. They were direct beneficiaries of the system collapse that happened with blessing (and probably financial help) of those oligarchs under the weight of economic problems and siege of nationalist forces. In a way we can believe in the "theory of convergence": both unrestricted "free market forces" and unrestricted government control eventually lead to the rule of oligarchy. I am not an economist but it looks very strange that an avid advocate of "free market" is at the same time a proponent of demonetarization of gold and usage of fiat currencies. In this sense his Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (often incorrectly called Nobel Prize in Economics) looks somewhat strange. With fiat currencies all businesses are hostages of the government. And the ability to switch money printing press to full speed any time the government finds convenient (usually to cover war expenses) provides an easy way of confiscation of wealth of people by government without any communist coup d'ï¿½tat. How stable is the world of fiat currencies remain to be seen. It should be noted that lately Freeman himself abandoned his "monetarist views" (and that makes chapter III, one of the central chapters of the book just a historical curiosity). But unfortunately Britain already serves as a guinea pig for his utopia. As for implementing his and other economic utopias I like the quote attributed to German Iron Canceller Otto von Bismarck about suggestion of one of German parliamentarians to implement socialism; I do not remember exact wording but it sounded like this: "OK let's do it, but let's first choose for this experiment a country, that we do not care about". 
In only 202 pages (who said professors can't boil things down to the essentials?) free market solutions are outlined to address some of our most serious problems. This is a win-win book. The ideas contained in it, if properly applied, could improve our economy and enhance our freedom at the same time 
Milton Friedman, now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia. "Capitalism and Freedom" dispels the so-called myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society. The book was orignally writeen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made. However, they are points that never go out of sytle. He refutes the lie that the free-market caused the depression (it was actually a tyrannical Federal Reserve), that socialism can be democratic, and others. Friedman discusses public education, roads, minimum wage laws (which he calls, "the most anti-black law on the books,"), as well as the how so-called "progressive" tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor. Please understand that Friedman is NOT a "right-wing" extremist as some knucklehead below states. He is a libertarian. He developed the idea of the negative income tax to help the poor. His ideas were to help people not hurt them with the free-market. Someone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. 
One of my faves. Friedman was one of the best. Also read THE ROAD TO SERFDOM by F. A. Hayek. As for Reviewer T.A. Turner: the good news is that your lobotomy IS reversible. There are a lot of brilliant ex-Marxists about these days. Reading Thomas Sowell for starters just may restore your mind. Of course, if it's your heart that's the problem.... Putting forth a man like V.I. Lenin who said: "It would not matter if 3/4 of the human race perished; the important thing is that the remaining 1/4 be communist" ---as an paragon of "compassion" is truly pathetic! Yeah, the "compassionate" followers of Marx, Trotsky, Lenin, Mao Pol Pot have thus far "liberated" by mass murder between 95 and 150 million souls. Purges, Pogroms and Killing Fields! No other political party in human history has shed so much blood in the space of a single century. And Mr. Turner's colon is is knots over a Goldwater cartoon! Give me a break 
The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper. Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did." If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet. 
This book is the apotheosis of freedom. Friedman should be studied not only by economists but also by politicians. Definitely a must 
Milton Friedman is one of the great economic thinkers of the 20th century. Based out of the University of Chicago, this Nobel Prize winner in Economics has consistently and cogently argued for the benefits of capitalism over any other form of economic organization. This, along with "Free to Choose" are his two major works establishing and explaining his beliefs. Within it, he argues against many established policies in the US federal government such as the minimum wage, subsidies, rent controls, and licensing requirements for practice in fields such as medicine and law. Likewise, he argues for many market-orientated alternatives to today's arrangements, such as increasing the use of school vouchers. The author argues that the concepts of capitalism are very similar to the concepts of democracy, and that the spread of one helps the spread of the other, and hence both should go hand-in-hand in terms of public policy. This book, along with his other writings, are the bedrock of modern-day economic conservatism and its creations such as health-care savings accounts, school vouchers, tradeable pollution emission allowances, etc... By reading this book, one gains a very thorough understanding of modern-day American conservatism. Unfortunately, the book minimizes the power of corporations and financial markets - speculators. The book also does not pay enough attention to the mining and energy industries, two sectors of the economy which often produce scandal and disasters when given over to the rule of free-market forces; i.e. Enron... Last, the author misses one key difference between democracy and capitalism. In democracy, one person gets one vote. In capitalism, this is rarely the case; some individuals will end up having more dollars (more votes) than other individuals. Overall, a good book, though not a great one. The book's arguments are well made and warrant understanding, though they are by no means universally correct. 
It is amazing how little has changed in our political dialogue in the 40+ years since this book was written. Friedman had chapters about social responsibility of business, taxes and incentives, free trade, vouchers and the role of government in the education system, and "fair" distributions of income, and trade protectionism to protect domestic industries and workers from "unfair foreign competition." Friedman compellingly argues that Capitalism is the best means of promoting freedom man has yet devised. He observes that "underlying most arguements against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself." People who speak of failures of the market are generally actually referring to market outcomes that are inconsistent with their views of propriety. He makes the telling point that politics forces conformity in decision making. Some form of majority decides issues, making that decision binding on all. Market forces "reduce strain on the social fabric by rendering conformity unecessary." It seems obvious then that the more decisions we leave to individuals, the more free we will be as a society. I found it interesting that much that Friedman is criticized for is done on fallacious grounds. He very clearly sees a role for government. Government should do the things the market can not do for itself. The most important of which is enforce the rules of the game and adjudicate disputes over the interpretation of those rules. Further, government can be profitably involved when neighboorhood effects, or externalities are present. He rightly cautions against the continued extension of neighboorhood effects, often just an excuse for a group looking for a special dispensation. He cautions us that one of the things we should fear most is the concentration of power. This is especially relevant today, given the continuing expansion of our Federal Government. He makes the interesting point that high marginal tax rates are impediments to becoming wealthy rather than a tax on being wealthy. This is right on the money and may help to explain why Americans of all income groups are opposed to very high marginal tax rates on income groups above their own. This is something the left should take note of. I also found his point that very high tax rates caused the wealthy to be much more risk averse to be quite revealing. The wealthy of the time properly perceived that with high marginal tax rates the wealth they had was all the wealth they would ever have. When Washington took 91% of your marginal income the odds were low that you would ever recoup a significant capital loss. I don't think it is a coincidence that as those rates have dropped the American economy has grown faster and become the premier innovator and new business developer in the world. Finally he has some interesting observations on the motivations of the egalitarians in society. He draws a great distinction between equality of rights and equality of outcome. The left insists on the latter, he feels the focus should be on the former. The conversion of the American intellectuals to communism/socialism has always puzzled me. How could people seemingly so intelligent espouse a system that has never been effective anywhere it has been tried. Friedman suggest that the "conversion of the intellectuals was achieved by a comparison between the existing state of affairs, with all its injustices and defects, and a HYPOTHETICAL state of affairs as it might be (emphasis mine). The actual was compared with the ideal." It now seems fairly well proven that the ideal is unattainable and also undesirable. For those of a libertarian bent this will be a great read. For those of a collectivist bent but an open mind this is well worth the time and may change your mind just a bit. 
I like these @ first, but then I just stopped reading them, and I have no idea why. Klaus is the middle child in this trio. He is amazingly smart. Violet can build inventions out of anything! And the youngest person in this trio is a girl named Sunny, who has amazingly sharp front teeth. I love the plot of these books. Count Olaf is a great character and I love to hate him! I juat have to read the twelfth book and then I've read them all. I definetely plan to read the next book in this series 
These books are some of the most incredibly creative and oringinal books I have ever read. I may be seventeen but I absolutley LOVE thse books. My best friend Ashton let me borrow them and I read the first one and I was hooked. No other author I have read can write as cleverly as he can. I could never choose a favorite, I love every one 
The books I received were in very good condition. I feel it took a bit long to actually receive the items. Especially due to the fact that I have ordered from other vendors before and saw a much faster turnaround 
Prime pasta. Perfect pasta - that's the only kind served by the authors in their Providence restaurant, Al Forno. Billy Joel claims their pizza is the best in the world. While I wouldn't argue with him, for me the easy to follow recipes offered in this imaginative, enormously satisfying cookbook are among the best to be found. The author's love and enthusiasm for the type of food they prepare is obvious on every page as they experiment, create, and enjoy. Explaining that work nights end late for them, they add that they're hungry so together they prepare what they call "midnight spaghetti." It's really a fun-loving competition between the two of them with simple rules: "Prepare a delicious sauce in the time it takes for a pot of water to boil and the pasta to cook." Among the dishes favored for these nocturnal feasts are Spaghetti with Fresh Spinach and Gorgonzola, Pantry Spaghetti, Vintner's Spaghetti, Pappardelle with Olives, Thyme, and Lemon. Recipes for these and other mouth-watering pasta dishes, whether appetizers or main courses, are found in this temptingly illustrated book. Of enormous help are the hints offered by this couple who have cooked tens of thousands of pounds of pasta at their restaurant. For instance, a good rule of thumb is four ounces of pasta per person as a main meal and half of that for a starter. Plus, a list of must-haves for your pasta pantry is indispensable, and saves hasty runs to the super market. Couldn't possibly choose a favorite from the many recipes offered but high on my list is Jo's Fast "Cheater's" Lasagne. Granted, I'm biased as pasta has always been a favorite dish, and I tend to heartily agree with the authors' admonition: "Don't trust people who don't like pasta." Highly recommended - enjoy! - Gail Cooke 
My title is way to simplistic for this story, but it gives you an idea. Tananarive Due brings us a unique look into suspense and horror that I have not seen before, giving us a cultural lesson at the same time. An engrossing read. I couldn't put it down 
From the minute I opened the book...I couldn't stop reading. It's refreshing to read such an entertaining novel from start to finish! 
I absolutely loved this novel. I usually read L.A. Banks Vampire Huntress series but I decided in a slight change of pace and boy did I get it. The story is about a woman trying to run away from her tragic past, with her child gone from a freak accident Angela doesn't know how to bounce back. After advice from a friend she decides to pick up the pieces from its point of origin, her grandmother's old house. This is a great ghost story but it involves so much more. It's a ghost story, a mystery, a drama, and of course Due uses a certain traditional African American religion as the basis of the novel. At times I feel like the author was channeling Steven King and I really did enjoy it, while the pace was a little slow in some parts the mystery of the story strings the reader along. Unlike Due's novel Joplin's Ghost the action starts on the first page and gets the reader invested 
I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel, and what can I say? I loved it. I've never read anything before by this author, but the narration, the spinechilling series of events and the loveable characters made me want to read more. I sincerely hope there is a sequel.  The story involves an ancient curse placed upon a woman's family which is unwittingly unleashed by her likeable teenage son, Cory. Cory's family must bear the brunt of a demon's tricks and wrath, which does at times have fatal consequences.  I particularly liked Shawn/Cory, Naomi and Onyx. I really do feel taht Tananarive can write excellent male characters. Her male characters seem very realistic and heartfelt. 5 stars 
Not very scary, too long, and poor character development. There are a lot of good reviews about the book. Maybe I missed something 
I found The Good House to be an exceptionally well written and suspenseful novel. The author did an excellent job of developing the story and the characters. There were only two minor drawbacks to the book. One was that at times I found it too frightening to read at night...but then again that's why people read books like this. Also, I agree with others who have pointed out that the ending is a bit on the Hollywood side. However neither of these was enough to prevent me from giving the book a 5 rating. This was my first book by Ms. Due but it most certainly won't be the last 
I really enjoyed this book - it kept me guessing what would happen next. I didn't want to put it down 
Angela Toussaint has nothing but warm, wonderful memories of her grandmother Marie, and summers at the Good House. And while her Haitian grandmother evokes only thoughts of goodness in Angela, the fact is that her grandmother was a very powerful voodoo priestess who was widely known for her powers. Angela is also blissfully unaware that many years prior her grandmother, driven to do so by anger, pride and a need for vengeance, summoned a spirit that would only mean death and destruction for her descendants. Being the powerful priestess that she was, she was able to put the demon to sleep....where it has lay dormant within the earth of the Good House all of these years. Returning to the small town of Sacajawea, Washington with her son Cory as she has done many times before, a simple task of cleaning the attic has sparked young Corey's curiosity in his grandmother; and before you know it, he is pouring through her book of spells and trying some of her magic. Magic that eventually unleashes the fury of a being that has been dormant for almost a century, bringing with it death and destruction to all of the Toussaints...... Fabulously well-constructed tale that draws the reader in with the very first paragraph. Too scary to read alone, yet too wonderful to put down. I have found a new favorite in this author. DY 
Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf 
A must for dog owners and a guide to go by. For 'do-it-yourself' instead of costly obedience classes. 
The Intelligence of Dogs by Stanley Coren takes a unique approach to assessing the intelligence of our canine companions. Coren is a psychologist and animal behaviorist and uses some innovative methods, typically used to measure human intelligence, on dogs. He gives interesting background information on canines and how philosophers once viewed them as biological machines incapable of thinking or feeling. This book would be helpful to a person trying to decide on a breed for a pet because of the breed specific information provided. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Man's Best Friend and whats going on in his mind. 
This was a book that I found absolutely delightful to read. Since I am a thorough-going dog nut the topic seized my attention immediately, and Dr. Coren did not disappoint. His style is lucid and thankfully free of a lot of jargon. This made for pleasant and informative reading. Enjoy 
The press on this book indicated it was written with charm and wit. Unfortunately it did not live up to that notice. The author is pedantic and takes himself and his subject much too seriously 
I couldn't even begin to count all the things Stanley Coren gets wrong in THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS. For instance, in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they can't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin. The first is clearly way beyond a dog's capacity, while the second is something which comes totally natural to them. How did Coren get things so backwards? And the "intelligence" tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test (or game) while you're doing it. For instance, I tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel, then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat. I'd still be waiting if I hadn't decided he'd never look under that towel. Then I tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys. Then I hid it under the towel, and it took him less than a second to get that toy. So my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of Coren's intelligence spectrum. (This is just one example, by the way: the whole idea of testing a dog's IQ like this is bogus.) And don't get me started on Coren's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth. Granted, he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy, or an alpha wolf, or the rest of that alpha nonsense. Though, I doubt if even that data would change Coren's mind. After all, he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly "signifies submission to the pack leader." (Really? Dogs use "signifiers" now?) The funny thing is, shortly after reading that passage I saw a wolf documentary on TV and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what Coren recommends! He rolled over on HIS back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose! They loved it! So I tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog--an alpha male, if there ever was one--and HE loved it. And later that night, on our last walk, he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before I'd mimicked the papa wolf's behavior. Again, Coren had everything exactly backwards to reality. This "through the looking glass" quality persists throughout the book, with Coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical, symbolic, and conceptual thinking. Wha..? I'm sorry. I love dogs and I think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected, but the abilities they DO have are geared for being a dog, not a mini-me with four legs and a tail. For one thing, fully one third of a dog's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information, and none to processing symbols and concepts. I think Coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book. 
In this The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of Our Canine Companions, Stanley Coren looks at how dogs think and what they feel by analyzing their actions. He begins by providing a persuading argument that dogs do think and show emotions. Then an interesting history is given of the views on the dog's mind throughout history, along with the three main proposed views of what dogs were first domesticated and used by people. Coren provides a few sections that are especially useful in interpreting what your dog is thinking or trying to say. I am a veterinary assistant and am around a lot of dogs all day, and these lists did provide me with some new information. The book also talks about the three different kinds of intelligence that dogs have. Coren clearly describes adaptive, working, and instinctive intelligence with the use of many personal examples. These examples are often interesting and entertaining to the reader, while strengthening Coren's point. In addition, Coren provides tips for the reader to evaluate his own dog's intelligence. I found the canine intelligence test and the personality test to be a fun activity for both me and my dog. The intelligence test helps you understand how your dog's intelligence compares to the rest of the dog world. The personality test determines what kind of personality your dog has and what the best techniques are for training it. The last few chapters of the book describe useful techniques for increasing a dog's intelligence and an easy-to-understand description of how the dog's brain works. The tips for improving my dog's intelligence seem to be really practical. The explanation of the science of the dog's brain is surprisingly easy to comprehend. Coren explains the brain's complexity in everyday terms. Overall, this book is very informative of the dog's mind, and it also seems to be partly biographical with all of Coren's stories and explanations of how he reaches his conclusions and conducts his research. This slight mixture of genres keeps me from becoming bored with an only informative book. I definitely recommend this book to any dog enthusiasts that are looking for an informative and entertaining book to read 
I can't believe I didn't know anything about this time in US History before. The Chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating. This book is very well written. You'd think a book about architecture might be dry, but its really not at all. Highly recommend this book. Its a slo a great book for a book club 
ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER, AND I READ 2 A MONT 
As a criminologist, I have a small library of books that range from sociological and crim theory to true crime and collective behavior and no book as given me more pleasure than this one. The research is impeccable and there are so many passages that will never find their way into a textbook, so it is now my goal to utilize this work by incorporating it into my lectures. This is a must read for anyone interested history, the impact of the industrial revolution on society and a study of the criminal mind in creating the victim-offender relationship. Bravo to Mr. Larson. 
Reads like a murder mystery, but represents itself as being factual. A really incredible story and a piece that should be read by all Chicagoans. (I live in Colorado but was born there.) Fran 
Extraordinarily well written. Highly recommeded for anyone interested in, not just Chicago history, but turn of the century events 
A fascinating look into Chicago's life and times at the end of the 19th century with the background of the World's fair and the personalities of the major movers and shakers of the era. 
A strangly fascinating book...didn't expect it to be so engrossing. Lived in Chicago for a time, and find I knew little about the history. The parallel plot was a stroke of genius...the bright lights...the century of progress, and the horror that was patiently waiting in the shadows!! JUST TERRIFIC!! 
I learned some odd new things reading this. Fascinating book- made me do more research on the exposition 
This book had me from the first line -- a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction. Two stories are told side by side, one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes Jack the Ripper pale by comparison. The result is a book that is almost impossible to put down. It left me with an appreciation of the energy, talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world's fair and the genius of inventors like George Ferris. 
Not only is the story heartwarming, the artwork is beautiful. Besides having this book in my personal library, I have purchased several copies for friends with dogs and give it as remembrance when their beloved pet goes to the Rainbow Bridge. It is definitely appropriate for any occasion, but there is a certain comfort when it is received during the difficult time after a pet is gone. Anyone who loves dogs, has to love this book 
For anyone who has loved and/or lost a dog, this book is peace for the soul. Since not many people know how to express condolences over the loss of a pet, this is a great place to make a memorial. Steve did a great job expressing the love and joy of having a K9 friend with his humor and expressive illustrations 
While attending a conference in Vermont, I was fascinated by several woodcuts of dogs by folk artist Stephen Huneck which were displayed in a local craft store. The ones which particularly caught my interest involved labrador retrievers engaged in simple tasks which captured the essence of the breed, e.g. loyalty, friendliness, joyfulfulness, and perserverance. I then noticed that the artist also had published three children's books incorporating woodcuts of his black Labrador retriever Sally at the beach, in the mountains, and on the farm. However, the book to which I was drawn both by the storyline and the pictures supplementing and illustrating the text was THE DOG CHAPEL. I learned that the author and his wife in fact live in St. Johnsbury, VT with their four dogs and that he has constructed THE DOG CHAPEL on his farm as a place that welcomes visitors of "all creeds [and] all breeds, [but with] no dogmas allowed". The preface briefly and movingly describes the near death experience which transformed the artist's (because that is the real occupation of this author) life and led to the construction of the chapel. The book is also movingly dedicated to Sally, the black Lab and his constant companion who helped nurse him back to health after he miraculously awoke from his coma but was unable to speak or move. During his recuperation, he was inspired (or as he puts it, he had the wild idea) to build the chapel to commemorate and share with others "the messages my dogs have taught me about the nature of love, joy, friendship, play, trust, faith, and peace". The next several pages of the book consist of gorgeous photographs of both the interior and exterior of the chapel. They succeed in capturing its simple beauty in the marvelous setting of the Vermont hills. There are simple stained glass windows and wonderful woodcarvings (the artist also is a sculptor and artisan who fashions hand carved furniture), as well as the accommodations being enjoyed by both human beings and their dogs. ( Of course, the chapel has its own dog door.) The remainder and overwhelming majority of the book is then devoted to woodcuts illustrating the various attributes and encapsulating the sort of experiences which lead to the deep bond which forms between people and their dogs. This is a book to be savored and repeatedly enjoyed. It is the sort of book to be left on the table next to your favorite chair so you can open it up and smile at the pictures which capture the essence of some of your favorite moments with your dog. It can also serve to ease the deep pain from the loss of a canine companion. Finally, it will then be conveniently at hand for the enjoyment of any guests who also happen to be doglovers. (Of course, given the prominence of retrievers in Huneck's artwork the book probably had some extra added attraction for me since we currently own a black Lab mix and a Golden Retriever and still mourn the death several years ago of our yellow Lab - Great Dane mix.) Although the price might seem a little expensive for such a slim volume, the cover and the binding are of high quality and the pages display the artwork to great advantage. I highly recommend this book, and as the commentary accompanying one of the illustrations suggests, after buying the book "if you feel that you are too old to play, [perhaps your next task should be to] buy a ball and a dog to go with it". Tucker Anderse 
This book is amazing. I recently lost my beloved companion of 9 years, and when I saw this book I had to buy it. I am proud to say I'm originally from Vermont and have been a fan of Steven Huneck for years. He has outdone himself with "The Dog Chapel." The illustrations and simple phrases reflect the love between a dog and his person. I miss my friend, but Huneck's book has helped me to grieve and heal 
Mr. Hunek conveys the power of the animal/human bond through beautiful photos of the chapel and whimsical woodcuts that describe the characteristics of our canine companions. The book tells how this unique chapel came to be built following the authors critical illness. As the sign outside the chapel says, "All breeds and all creeds welcome. No dogma allowed". This book would make a cherished gift for all dog lovers regardless of their religious or spiritual beliefs 
This is a wonderful book for the creative spirit or crafty mom. Instead of spending your hard earned cash on flimsy costumes that may get only one wear, you can make your own. It includes a multitude of colorful photos and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions to make many exciting and unique costumes. Some of them include: a king, robot, knight in shining armour, magician, cowboy and hula girl. This would be a great book to use for Halloween costumes as well as for dress up and role play. Many of the costumes can be made by kids themselves. It will save you money and the kids will have a great time 
I enjoyed this book because most of the items for making the costumes you can find around the house. 
This book is creepy. If you like ghost stories, with a twist its pretty good. I enjoyed this book , however its not my favorite. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because it maintained my interest 
Ask a King fan what book is his best, and you will most likely hear "It" or "The Stand" as the answer. Maybe the occasional "The Shining", or you may have asked a Dark Tower fan who puts those books above and beyond the rest of the canon. As for me, I'd simply say "Bag of Bones". I've read almost everything King's done, and a lot of it is great. Really great. He's easily my favorite author, but in my opinion nothing he's written has topped Bag of Bones. I don't want to say much about the story, as you really need to just experience it yourself, but it is poignant, scary, and somehow awe-inspiringly beautiful. Read it. You won't be disappointed. Then read his new one, Lisey's Story, which is in more than one way a kind of "mirror piece" when compared to Bag of Bones. By the way, I actually think I read once that King himself believes Bag of Bones to be his best. If so, he and I agree 
King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one. There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing. For the most part, not bad. Would make a good movie 
Not to take anything away from my favorite author BUT I thought the book was way too long. The story was suspenseful and descriptive but I found myself getting lost in the superfluous background. (And this is someone who has read The Stand at least six times so it's not the length of the book that bothered me as much as the length of the storyline.) Stephen King fans will still enjoy the book but not as much as some others such as The Cell which I thought was great 
It's amazing how fast King drew me into this story. Then he broke my heart a few times before the end of chapter two, and after that I just read on like a man possessed. A few bits feel plotted, but I don't care. King's novels have never been about their plots. That's news to Hollywood, I think, but not to you and me. King doesn't write short books you can devour in a single sitting or two. Nah, you spend a week with one of these babies, savoring every moment. He's fully capable of being a sick bastard, don't you doubt that, but he's equally capable of messing with you on far more disturbing levels. I bought a big pile of King novels at the Xinhua Bookstore on Yan An Lu, which probably means the author got his royalties. (Yes, I do live in China.) I assumed I'd quit reading at least some of them after the first 10%. But, pleasant surprise here, I've read every single one from cover to cover and enjoyed them all. I'm so happy about that. I've dwelled upon them after my reading and reviewing was done. And, while I can't be certain because my Kings are in a box instead of on a bookshelf right now -- I have no bookshelf -- I think this is the last one. Egad! Just so my subscribers know -- all three of you, haha! -- the protagonist is an author named Michael, and his wife dies suddenly in first paragraph. Does that give King special access to what I fear the most? Nah, it actually makes me giggle at the coincidence. No matter. King writes so well that I forget to giggle. So well that can only say "wow" and forget my jealousy. It's enough that I can read his books. I don't have to write them. Hey, writing is hard. Reading, if the author does his job, is easy. King does his job. Oh yes he does. 
It may seem self-indulgent for King to make his protagonist a writer of romantic suspense. King sounded a bit defensive on the promotional tape his publisher sent reviewers. Wambaugh was a cop, and he writes about cops, King says. You have to write about what you know, he goes on, just like he writes about Maine. There are many themes and mysteries in this book. Some of my favorites are the ideas concerned with recreational reading. King and his editor both suggest that this book owes a lot to Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca. So not surprisingly, it is a ghost story. With some fictional monsters, like vampires or zombies or what ever, our suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy the story may involve considerable effort. But ghosts? For anyone who has ever experienced the loss of a loved one, it is almost impossible not to believe in ghosts. An interesting fact that King's character encounters constantly is that women in this country read more than men. Men characters in the book, when they meet the author, always say something like "You are my wife's favorite writer." Another story that is referred to frequently is "Mars is Heaven" by Ray Bradbury. I love this story, even more so because it is part of a cycle of stories which Bradbury wrote known as The Martian Chronicles. I am a bit concerned about King's use of the story here, because he summarizes it a bit abruptly, and it is a tale which relies on a surprise ending, so it would benefit readers to find a copy of The Martian Chronicles and read that first, before reading Bag Of Bones. I believe "Mars is Heaven" is the original title, and the title that was used in several anthologies many years ago. It would be hard for readers to find it with that title now, however, as I think it was published as "The Third Expedition" in The Martian Chronicles. Bag of Bones, simply summarized, involves a popular writer who's wife dies unexpectedly. Soon, he finds himself griped with a paralyzing writer's block. He flounders through his life, in the course of tying to put things back together, and finally visits their summer house in a tiny village which he has avoided since his wife's death, because of the feeling that it was mainly her place. It is here that he begins to encounter various spirits. Not to mention a young widow and her three year old Shirley Temple-sweet daughter. He soon becomes romantically involved with the widow as he tries to protect them from a rich and evil step father. He begins to unravel secrets that his dead wife has kept from him, which mysteriously involve the history of their summer house and the surrounding community. King conjures enormous suspense and finally resolves the plot with some rather violent incidents and horrible revelations. I know everyone will be annoyed by my nitpicking, but one bag of bones in the plot is "dissolved" almost instantaneously with a strong solution of lye. I just have to point out that lye isn't very suitable for dissolving bones, as it is an alkaline. A strong acid would have worked better, quicker. King mentions in his promotional tape that he doesn't like doing research, but someone should have been able to point this out. As I've mentioned, one of the interesting things about this book is the thoughts about recreational reading. Toward the end, King's character deplores violence, even fictional violence like the killings which are frequently the basis of murder mysteries, and by extension part of the violent conclusion of this book. I enjoy analysis of mysteries and detective stories, and I have always wondered why, exactly, murders seem to be a necessary part of a large group of entertaining, memorable stories. I share a bit of the uneasiness that King expresses here. Overall, I think fictional violence is part of a mechanism that writers use to stress the characters they create 
I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages. Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
Four years back, a friend introduced me to Dean Koontz. I fell in love, and started buying his books. Koontz was a name I never knew, but Stephen King was a name I grew up on. I was hooked on Koontz, and realized I wanted to give the same chance to King...someone in a similar genre (whose name I recognized). I have since discovered that King continually has something that Koontz does not always have. Koontz is a master of keeping one in suspence, sure, but King is a master of words. He can make something sad, horrific, painful...seem appealing. He writes just beautifully, and is a rare writer who evokes a sort of external emotion. I can't give the book a 5 (it could have been probably 50 pages shorter and had the same affect) but I want to give it a 4.5. It is just that good. I teared up, I was shocked, I laughed, all together when I read this book. It is not so much a thrasher, horror-type novel (as one might be used to seeing from King) as it is a love story which continues after one of the two-person party dies, with some severe dedication mixed inbetween. Please, go read this book, I can't wait to read it a second time. 
Bag of Bones presents a mystery/suspense sans the typical gore of Stephen King. I am a fan of King and have read many of his books simply for the intrigue they bestow onto me; however, Bag of Bones breaks free of the typical King paradigm and soars to new heights. Mike Noonan, a mildly successful author, experiences great tragedy when his beloved wife, Joanna, dies suddenly from a brain aneurysm. When he travels to their summer home, entitled Sara Laughs, to properly grieve his late wife, he encounters a poor, young widow whose daughter is greedily coveted by her wealthy grandfather. Noonan is instantly immersed in a struggle between an old billionaire and his daughter in law's child. While doing all that he can for his widow friend, Mike unravels another mystery in Sara Laughs. He discovers another presence is in the house with him and refuses to leave until Mike learns what the presence wants him to learn. At first, he thinks the ghost is that of his wife, Joanna, but the more powerful the presence becomes, the more Mike is forced to question its true identity and... his own safety 
This book surprised me in that I enjoyed it so much. I mean I have always loved King's work but this one resolidified me as a fan and more proof that King knows exactly what he's doing when he writes. The book surrounds Mike Noonan, a writer, who's young wife dies suddenly. After four years of writer's block and never being able to move on Noonan goes to stay at their summer cabin Sara Laughs in a small (you guessed it) Maine town. What follows is a story about lost loves, new friendships and love, haunted houses and a secret that the town has had hidden for over 100 years. For some it might be long (732 pages) but I found its pace to be so good you end up reading it into the wee hours of the night. This is one of those books I just couldn't put down because I wanted to know the solution to the mysteries. Definetly read this book, in a way it's so unlike King's normal ventures because it has a whodunit feel, that is not common to his novels. 
A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
and even if you know nothing about baseball like me, Kearns Goodwin has hit a home run with "Wait till Next Year." You will learn all about the rivalry between the Mets and the Yankees and the history of Goodwin's beloved Brooklyn Dodgers. She tells all about her heroes Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges and Roy Campanella. All of these great baseball nuggets are woven into her story of growing up in Brooklyn in the '50s, and is so evocative of a time and place that was quintessentially American. This book will make you long for a town like Rockville Centre, sometime between 1949 and 1957 
I, too, grew up on Long Island in the 50s and early 60s (two years in Queens and ten years out on "duh oyland".) I'm a few years younger; the Dodgers were already in Hollywood and I rooted for the hated Jankees. But the images of this beautiful memoir were so resonant with my childhood, from soothing sound of Red Barber's voice coming from the tinny transistor radio to the edicts from the diocese of Rockville Centre, read periodically in lieu of a Sunday sermon, mostly asking for more money. I have only occasionally returned to Long Island since we moved away when I was 14, and like everywhere else, it is just not the same. Ms. Goodwin's experiences are just about as close as I have ever come to going back home. For those of our generation who grew up in parts of the country other than Long Island, I believe, at least I hope, that these recollections can return you to that wonderful time the way they did for me 
Doris Kearns Goodwin seems to have written a book about her growing up in the NY suburbs for her own pleasure of simply remembering the "simpler" days before free agency, adulthood and the pressures that come to all of us as we move along in years. Her storytelling is at times pure magic, when it was the Dodgers of Brooklyn, the Yankees of The Bronx and the Giants of Manhattan and the Polo Grounds. The hope of a baseball fan shows beautifully and reminds us all that we needn't lose all of our childish passion simply because the years pass. One is reminded of the past couple of years with the Red Sox ending "the Curse" and the White Sox winning in style in the South Side of Chicago. It leaves Cubs Nation truly understanding this concept - Next Year. While the book is clearly a pleasant read one cannot help but wonder if any author by Dr. Goodwin would have gotten this published. That doesn't mean it should not have been; rather she had the ability, through her name as a writer of history, to make this book happen. A wonderful summer read. 
Just re-read this book. Wonderful story about growing up in the sweetness of the 1950's, but also about overcoming childhood loss, to become a very successful person--author, wife and mother. 
Doris Kearns Goodwin took a break from national history to get personal in this 1997 memoir of her experiences growing up a Long Island girl in the 1940s and 1950s rooting for the hard-luck Brooklyn Dodgers. Like Bob and Ray used to say, her loss is your gain. I admit approaching this book with some trepidation. Clearly the book was inspired by Goodwin's participation as one of many talking pinheads on Ken Burns' self-important 1994 TV documentary "Baseball." On that show, where various hoi pollois traded their mortarboards for Yankee caps and extolled the Wagnerian ideal of a Whitey Ford fastball, Goodwin was a frequent, annoying presence, obviously trotted in to water down the testosterone as if George Will wasn't enough to accomplish that. And for the first hundred pages of this not-big book, I felt justified in my prejudices, as Goodwin fills her pages with pat descriptions of suburban life loosely connected to a baseball team she writes about her enthusiasm for without any evident enthusiasm. But once the book got going, my opinion changed. That happened when little Catholic Doris enters a confessional before her first Holy Communion. With wholesome piety, she tells the priest her darkest, most sinful secret: A wish that Yankee pitcher Allie Reynolds would break his arm. That's not all. "I wished that Enos Slaughter of the Cards would break his ankle, that Phil Rizzuto of the Yanks would fracture a rib, and that Alvin Dark of the Giants would hurt his knee." The priest is put out, not at her fantasies of carnage but because he's a Dodgers fan, too: "I believe they will win the World Series someday fairly and squarely," he tells her. "You don't need to wish harm on others to make it happen." But it's easy to imagine Doris thinking otherwise, especially after Bobby Thomson slams a Ralph Branca fastball along with the Dodgers' hopes for making the Series in 1951. As Goodwin writes about that and later seasons, her account takes on a riveting poignancy that reminds one why Goodwin's books are so celebrated in the first place, not for her originality as a historian but for her synthesizing skill as a writer. She even gets the chance to see her heroes close up, and unlike the baseball stars of today, they don't disappoint. Gil Hodges accepts her gift of a St. Christopher medal to help him out of a batting slump with gentle affection. Jackie Robinson signs her autograph book with a bit of hard-earned wisdom: "Keep your smile a long, long while." No, the book's not perfect. It starts slow, and her attempts to tie her childhood in with big stories of the day like the Army-McCarthy hearings and the integration standoff in Little Rock feel like strained, politically correct cocktail chatter rather than a real accounting of a young life amid confusing times. But most of the way through, you get a really sweet and sharp picture of what it was like to care about baseball when it was worth caring about. Goodwin has a gift for making history live again in the pages of her books, and like Ebbets Field, presents her readers here with a real diamond in the rough 
I love Doris Kearns Goodwin's work, and this book is no exception. It's very different from her other books, but very enjoyable. It brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers. Very short in comparison to her other books, but worth the time and the money. I have heard complaints that she got some of the baseball facts wrong, but I am not a baseball historian, so this didn't bother me in the least bit. 
It's been a while for me since I read this one, but one impression clearly stuck, happy bright childhood in the 1950's and, yes, baseball. It was overall well written memoir, very optimistic, full of childhood memories of a neighborhoodly and cozy streets and people. I think that besides being a well written woman's memoir a baseball fan should find the book to be a treat as well 
In 1949, when Doris Kearns was six and living in Rockville Center, NY, her father taught her how to chart and score a baseball game, the primary (radio) entertainment of her community. In these years, it was baseball that unified the local community, though whether one was loyal to the Brooklyn Dodgers, as Kearns was, the NY Yankees, or the NY Giants was a different matter. For Kearns Goodwin, the youngest in the family, it was baseball which served as her ritual connection to her father, since she sat with him after dinner each night and related the scoring of that day's game. It is to these baseball narratives that she attributes her early interest in data collection and in story-telling (since she discovered her father stayed interested when she could keep him in suspense), traits which she believes helped make her the world-renowned historian she has become. As she describes her life during 1949 - 1956, when either the Dodgers or the Giants played in the World Series, usually against the NY Yankees, she connects her life at home and in the community with her fierce love of the Dodgers, and especially her hero, Jackie Robinson. Showing how team loyalties were related to the social structure of her town, Kearns Goodwin characterizes the friendly rivalries within the community. Becoming the official "window" scorekeeper one summer for the local butcher shop, in which the two butchers, Giants fans, kept the neighbors up to date re the Giants record, Kearns Goodwin ("Ragmop"), then eight, was the "official" scorekeeper for the Dodgers. The high point of her baseball "fan-dom" was the Dodgers win over the Yankees in 1955 for the World Series championship, when she was twelve. Throughout this remarkable memoir, Kearns Goodwin connects her family life to baseball. Her father's sad life before his marriage, in which he was orphaned at a young age; his love for her mother, always ill as a result of childhood rheumatic fever; her devotion to her older sisters; and her interest in family history are all connected in her mind (and in this memoir) with baseball. Her trips to Ebbets Field, where she sought autographs; her adolescence, in which her interest in baseball competed with her interest in boys; and the importance of baseball in her life following the death of her mother, attest to the cultural allure of the "all-American pastime." Capturing a moment of social history, Kearns Goodwin puts the early fifties into perspective, and shows the lasting importance of baseball on her professional and personal development. A remarkable memoir by one of the all-time great baseball fans. n Mary Whipple 
I finished reading,"Wait Till Next Year", last evening and I would like anyone who enjoys memoirs or simply appreciates beautiful writing, to run out and grab Ms. Goodwin's charming book. A recollection of the life she led in Long Island N.Y. and the journey she made with the Brooklyn Dodgers. It is not just about baseball, it's about growing up in the late forties and fifties, about family life, a coming of age story for Doris and "Dem Bums".This past summer was the 50th anniversery of the Dodgers first world championship in 1955 and it seemed an appropriate time to read Ms. Goodwin's memoir and I'm so very happy I did. 
I've re-read this book several times now. Lani Diane Rich is a master of romantic comedy and the offbeat heroine. For those of us who are tired of reading ultra-perfect female heroines, Wanda's a breath of fresh air, slightly tinged with the scent of Scotch. It's hard for me to believe that other reviewers here never let go with a four-letter word when things aren't going well, and the author's willingness to go there with her character gives Wanda the feel of "the real". Any woman with a pulse (and a closet Jimmy Stewart fan,) will fall in love with Walter and his quirky smile, his protectiveness, and his obvious love for an imperfect woman. The secondary characters are excellent, the story draws you in, and before you know it, you're reading it again. Great book. I truly enjoyed it. Lani Diane Rich, YOU don't write fast enough ;-) 
or any book written in the first person, but i did enjoy this book. The heroine was flawed, which i liked, but the hero was a saint, which I didn't quite believe. Oh, don't get me wrong, Walter is a man any woman would want, but the big question is WHY did he want Wanda? Even so, I thought the book was better than average. 
I can't believe people are actually raving about this book. I was so offended by the inappropriate language that I could not possibly enjoy the experience of reading the story. The main character is acting like she is 3, rather than 32. This is hardly destined to be a classic and I would not recommend it to anyone who has any literary taste. 
I met this author at the Romance Writers of American national conference in Reno, where I learned she had been nominated for a Rita (think "Oscars" for Women's Fiction) for best first book. She was such a delight that I had already decided to buy the book-even before she won the award. I was certainly not disappointed. I like characters with a lot of hubris, and I especially enjoy female protagonists who do not require a prince charming to "fix" their lives. Even if they meet him. Fun secondary characters (Bones is great!), too. Terrific read-I highly recommend this book 
A friend referred me to this new author, and I truly owe her one. Lani Diane Rich made me laugh and cry, and also kept me entertained for the entire story. At a time in my life when reading something "grown-up" is a luxury at best, this book provided a wonderful escape. I can't wait to get the next two books, and hope she continues writing for all of us that are now hooked on her characters. Thanks for a great read 
Good golly this is a terrible book! I endured the first 100 pages hoping it would get better and when it didn't, I skimmed to the end. The plot is vapid, the writing is choppy and awkward, and I could guess the outcome by page 15. Rich plows through the story, not really explaining or developing anything, seemingly writing down the first idea that pops into her head. Her lame attempts at humor are just that - lame. There is no character development or realism here. This is a book where total strangers become best friends in a five minute phone call, loving parents disown their daughter because she is trapped in an abusive relationship, a 32-year-old names all her bottles of Scotch "Albert," and terms like "Hoo-wah" and "bo-doob-oom-chaa" are meant to convey that a character is falling in love. One of the things I really hate is when authors serve up a perfect character, one absolutely devoid of flaws or realistic human behavior, in an attempt to make the readers care. Rich has swung too far the other way and has developed one of the most loathsome and irritating protagonists I have ever had the misfortune to meet. Wanda is a selfish, obnoxious, loud-mouthed brat and by the end of the first chapter I was earnestly rooting for her complete and total demise. The other character's sudden affections for her are wholly without merit and seem contrived, to say the least. The front and back covers are littered with glowing tributes by other authors. If they really think this is good writing, I'll make sure to avoid their works as well as Rich's. The author's note brags that the first draft of this book was written in 25 days. I believe it. Maybe she should take a bit more time with her next attempt, if there is one 
Lani Diane Rich made a booming debut with Time Off for Good Behavior. I originally read the book when it first came out and recently re-read the novel; it was even better the second time around. Among legions of cookie cutter chick lit authors, Rich stands out with her snappy, humourous dialogue and delightfully flawed characters. If you're a lover of chick lit or you just enjoy witty conversation and authors who hold nothing back, you'll love Time Off For Good Behavior 
This was a really entertaining story. My only complaint is that I was able to finish it in a few hours. The dialogue is natural and funny, and Wanda is lovable in spite of her obvious flaws. I can't wait for Ms. Rich's next effort 
Hard to resist - impossible to put down. It was terrific from the get go. I found Wanda to be a very likeable character and no more litigious than the next person who was blown up in a gas leak and left in a coma from the cross examination of a "pencil faced" lawyer. I was rooting for her. It's hilarious, like when Wanda looks like a matchstick after a haircut, and the storyline is fresh. For me, the story went from enjoyable to "must recommend to others" when Wanda discovers the music mystery - everything this author came up with - all the details mentioned are incorporated into the storyline, not just thrown in. It makes for a very satisfying ending. (There's no surprising last minute silly coincidences just to wrap up the story). My only complaint is that it was over too soon. I'm anxious to read the next book from this author! 
one must read this book. This book is a great experience of every reader who can go throughly 
This book is a parody, a satire written by a very knowlegebale author. It is about a young Jewish immigrant,Vladamir, who has lived in the USA for 15 years and at the opening of the novel is 25 years old.He is having trouble adapting to life in America. He is a paasive non initiated person in the American way of life.He hold a bureaucratic job. He paints a parody of the USA and is a satire with much humor about the nineties. To be successful he decides he needs power, money, sex appeal and an American woman. To get these things he undertakes marginal even criminal activites. His adventures are humerous. He fails. A link to the Russian Mafia causes him to escape to a fictitious Eastern Block Country and to the City of Prava (probably Prague). There again his aggressive not though activities put him in danger with the local mafia and eventually he returns to America. In Europe He is still after the same inner needs for success that he longs for in the USA. Over 5 years he somewhat matures and integrates more his American and Russian identities though he still feels a person living in two worlds.(The life of many first generation immigrants). His adventures are erotic aggressive, funny rediculous and sometimes criminal. The author has a very thorough knowledge of Russian culture and literature which he refers to in the text, often in a very funny way. The prose is long and drawn out and not always easy to follow.The book is very clever.If you want a look at the modern world through the eyes of a Jeweis Russian immigrant the book is worthwhile 
Vladmir Girshkin is an unlikeable schemer who spends most of the story fleeing those whom he has defrauded or angered. He deals with a series of bizarre girlfriends and an even less likeable mother. Eventually moving from New York to the fictional ex-Soviet satellite republic of Stolavia, Vladmir ascends to a non-violent but powerful role within Russian organized crime. The detailed side characters range from charmingly offbeat to intensely annoying. Shteyngart hilariously mocks the vapid trendiness and vain sophistry of overeducated, underworked American postgraduates in Europe. He also explores issues of national and personal identity as Vladmir moves back and forth from America to Europe. I'm definitely interested in reading more from this author. 
The characterization of Vladimir Girshkin is excellent, from how he looks and dresses (which morphs through the book), to how he thinks about himself, his family, his ethniticity, to how he perceives the other Russians and Americans around him. Many humoristic moments as Vladimir, in an effort to get himself out of a dead-end life, gets in with deeper and crazier schemes to extract money and respect from different criminal elements, all the while building (or rebuilding?) the ego inside the man. The characterization, as a trip of self-discovery, is very well written. But I did find myself forcing to finish. I did end up caring about the characters, esp. Vladimir and Morgan in the end, so I pushed on wanting to see what happened to them. But the plot bogged down, taking turns that made the humourously ludicrous ones in the beginning of the story seem normal. You have to suspend your reality checks for a novel like this, but it just got harder to do toward the end. The clever literary references and play on words at the later half of the novel didn't make me chuckle or think as much as the ones in the beginning. I will read Mr. Shtenyngart's next novel with anticipation. Writing any novel is hard work, and I'm glad Gary pressed on with number 2 
This was an excellent book that defies description. It's unpredictable, constantly changing focus and rhythym. It's funny, and observant, and really feels like an insightful work of fiction. I had never heard of this book before, until I saw a New York Times article listing "famous literary places in New York" and included this book. Since it was listed with other greats (among them: Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, etc) I ordered it on Amazon. I wasn't disappointed, but it doesn't rise to that level. My biggest (and some of my only) problems with the book include both unnecessary fictionalization (fake European countries, cities, languages, cultures) that are thinly veiled (Czech, Russian, circle one) and some pretty implausible characters. Other than that, very readable and very entertaining book 
The title of this book is a misnomer; there's no Russian debutante in the book. Unless you count 25-year-old Vladimir Girshkin, who came to the U.S. from Leningrad as a young boy 
I came across this book when advising a friend's college-age child who was researching careers and was using this book. On the plus side, the book does contain info on basic job search skills. I would say that most (if not all of it) is now widely available via the internet. Very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers - some of it was just outdated, but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being "dangerous" for a reader with little knowledge or experience, and who would choose to spend time/effort pursuing a career based on the info in this book. I would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice 
I am saddened by the utterly unfair and inappropriate posting here by one reader. She had not read the book, but because I am a mere moderate feminist rather than a radical one, she chooses to excoriate me here. A far more unbiased source, USA Today's review of my book said, "From finding the well-suited job to customizing it, this book is full of smart advice." In the Reader's Choice Poll, it was rated the #1 most useful career guide. Here on Amazon, you can read sample material from the book. I encourage you to do that before making your decision 
Sorry, I just cannot believe that the "humorous" and "honest" approaches recommended in this book will work. It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words "sense of entitlement" come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think 
Very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor. In the first story he explains his job as an Elf at Santaland and describes his daily life. It is so funny, some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time. Don't buy this book if you are looking for a nice book to read to your young kids or just sit in front of the fire reading a romantic book while it is snowing outside. But if you are looking for something funny and odd at the same time, then by all means buy this book 
If you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you. He may push it sometimes but isn't that what a good writer should do? Knowing he is half Greek, so am I, I was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard. Unfortunately there wasn't one. Santaland was my favorite 
I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
...David Sedaris was only famous for talking about Christmas. Santaland Diaries, heard on NPR stations across the country, is what gave him his first fame. This collection of stories came after his first book, Barrel Fever, and before the rest. This is back when he was still writing short stories, which he isn't really known for anymore. This book has a couple of short stories and, like the short stories in Barrel Fever, they're not really accessible to a wider audience. They're dark - baby murder dark. Definitely not something everyone can appreciate. But pick it up, maybe you'll like it. If you're the sort of person who finds the idea of a theatre critic reviewing children's holiday pageants bitterly, it's worth a try 
Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, "aren't I hilarious?" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book. Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book. The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales. (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely. So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher. I'll never know. Neither should you.) I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters. They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them. Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too. 
If you are looking for the literary equivalent of "It's a Wonderful Life"-this book is definitely NOT for you. However, if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays, you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by David Sedaris. From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the "Christmas [...]" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris 
I was sitting on an airlpane reading this book and the gentleman next to me asked me if I was "OK". I was uncontrollably laughing. Even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure, it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds I was embarrassing myself again. 
David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along. This one did not disappoint either.. FUNNY holidays tales that make the season brighter, or even out of season.. give you a healthy hearty laugh. I adore this man 
Truly the author's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on Christmas, parents, children, evangelical Christians from Kentucky, television, Macy's, the result of a dalliance during the Viet Nam War, and "keeping up with the Joneses". This short book is much funnier than his best-selling "Me Talk Pretty Some Day" as the author's humorous cynicism is at its best. One can't put it down for fear of missing some insight into the American psyche. Three of the stories appear to be autobiographical (with obvious changes made to "protect the innocent") wherein the author "tells" the others in the guise of another. Regardless, Sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches, even if there's a little guilt attached to that feeling. 
The great Dallas Theological Seminary professor Dr. Hendricks shares with others his basic principles for passing on to his students the knowledge and passion for God's Word. Basically the book can be boiled down to one primary principle - you must have passion for what you know to transfer what you know to others. The book was originally released as The Seven Laws of the Teacher, but has since been repackaged and re-released under this new title with a new cover and design - but the truths shared by Hendricks are timeless and powerful - and should be read by EVERY teacher! The first law of the teacher was the best, in my opinion - if you ever stop growing today, you stop teaching tomorrow. Dr. Hendricks challenges the teacher to remain a student, to always continue learning, pursuing truth and knowledge - and to pass that thirst on to their students - far more important than any particular lesson or tidbit of information is the thirst for knowledge and truth - and that is something that is modeled for students in the lives of the teacher. If the teacher is stale, the lessons and information can't be fresh! The Seven Laws of the Teacher are as follows: * The Law of the Teacher - if you stop growing today, you stop teaching tomorrow. * The Law of Education - the way people learn determines how you teach. * The Law of Activity - maximum learning is always the result of maximum involvement. * The Law of Communication - to truly impart information requires the building of bridges. * The Law of the Heart - teaching that impacts is not head to head, but heart to heart. * The Law of Encouragement - teaching tends to be most effective when the learner is properly motivated. * The Law of Readiness - the teaching-learning process will be most effective when both student and teacher are adequately prepared. 
This is the best book on teaching out there. Every teacher must read this book, and not just once, but every year. It is very practical and easy to read. Dr. Hendricks defines teaching as "causing people to learn" (87). The teacher is not somebody who covers material but enables students to change. Thus, the definition of learning is "change." This book is highly recomended 
THis is an easy read and great instruction manual. I've only read the first 2 chapters and I'm excited about reading the rest. I hope to become a teacher who chages lives. 
Communication and caring compassion is the key to teaching. Hendricks uses the acronym, "TEACHER," to relate his concepts. The examples of teacher-student interaction shared in his book illustrate the importance of communication and show of care that motivates students to learn. He states, "The greatest teachers are not necessarily the people up front with high visibility. They are the people who have great heart. They communicate as a total person, and they communicate to the total person of their hearers (87)." Another way to be a "person of impact," is to be "vulnerable" with one's students. Not only are communication and compassion important, but preparation. Hendricks relates, "Teaching involves a delicate balance between facts and form, between content and communication, between what you teach and how you teach it (77)." If teachers want to prepare their students to "think, learn, and work," then four skills need to be taught: "reading, writing, listening, and speaking" (48). Though this book is written for Sunday school teachers, it contains helpful suggestions for use in other teaching venues. For instance, Hendricks suggests a "self-examination" in which teachers ask three questions: "What are my strengths; what are my weaknesses, and what do I have to change?" (35). Great teachers are the ones who continue to grow in their own personal learning. Hendricks' book is a good reminder for all teachers of the main purpose for Bible teaching. Even if the teacher teaches in a secular institution, the basic principles of the book can be utilized. For instance, students will be more willing to try harder and put more effort into their school work if they know the teacher truly cares for them. 
This book is an excellent resource for Church Education staff. This book covers some basic principles (or laws as he calls them) regarding teaching in the church environment. The law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch, as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment. This is so true and often followed in higher education, but perhaps not very well followed in church education. The sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning. But according to Henricks a student must study, must come to class on time, and must be interested in the material to proactively learn. There is much more good stuff in this book. Grab it its a great read 
When it comes to impact Howard Hendricks is a master teacher. Following these proven principles helped my college classes become full. These principles work in formal classes, at any level, and in informal instruction. Parents will become more effective in their parenting. This is a small, easily read book that will produce big dividends. 
Glassman's, first law of Phillip Fisher financial investing is "become a partner in a good business, for a long time": get information about the companies your are buying and ignore price trends, keep the stocks for the long run - at least 5 years, believe that assets are linked to time because time is the single most important factor in investing. Look for companies that 1. have a consistent track record of increasing earnings of at least 7 percent for the last ten years 2. have a good prospect of surviving over the next 50 years 3. don't have huge capital demands for the profits. Ideally, this means the company is rich; it has a service or product that produces a growth rate in earnings over a ten years because ten years suggests reasonable market dominance; and invest in companies that will offer value, in the future. What are people looking today that will meet these criteria? Biotech, Robotics, Fuel cells, and alternate energy. However, most of these companies are emerging technologies which would not qualify them from investment opportunity short term. Large companies like Genetech would qualify, whereas, small companies like iRobot would not because it does not have a ten year track record. Glassman conservative Warren Buffet like approach demands forces the investor too follow the maximum, "Do not invest too lose money." Furthermore, Glassmans conservative view attacks speculation and favors Graham security investment strategies of predictability. Glassman surprisingly does not predict doom for the speculators, instead says, "history shows that the fate of the stock market is closely connected to the fate of the economy". A speculator would own hugh about of stock or commodities in a few sectors, whereas, a security investor would diversify into a portfolio of many stocks. Well, why not just invest into a Index or the whole market, per recommendation by John Bogle? The Index returns about 7 percent and does not require buying and selling commissions. It is obvious, that Glassman has some speculation visions, as a part of his core beliefs and hopes for above market average profits. Glassman attempts to justify his risk based beliefs by saying, "when you hold a stock long enough, it becomes less risky than a bond." The assumption is the investor will select a stock that will not have wide fluctations, large downward trends, and cause the investor too sell because of pain; and having faith the stock market will outperform bonds, he makes the prediction that stocks will be higher priced over time. Glassman has not decided against risk stating, "prudent behavior is a key to investing", "volatility can an investors best friend because it offers good stocks at bargin prices", and "risk is a necessary evil in the stock market". This is the language of a speculator. Don't trade stocks. Buy low and sell high is impossible for an investor to turn a profit. Short term investing is a losing game reeling in the suckers by the thousands. The only way to make money short term is to own the market and have the financial power to manipulate it. So the best investment advice for an average investor with less than a billion dollars is too dollar cost average. In other words, invest money consistently over a large period of time and let the average work, for ones benefit. One good idea is too use a low cost broker, such as, sharebuilder and setup an investment plan of 10% a pay period diverting into a purchase plan which cost about $4 per transaction. Pay no attention too the Fed. This is illogical. If the stock market is affected by the economy than if the Fed monetary policies cause inflation or deflation, the stock market valuations will also change. Glassman must be assuming that investors do not borrow money to make their stock purchases. Interest rates slow down or heat up the economy. High interest rates slow down company earnings, if they are heavy in debt. Glassman investments do not carry heavy debt loads and operate cash rich and this justifies ignoring high interest rates. However, it does not explain the interconnected web of commerce where companies are constantly adjusting their inventories either too cut costs or replenish depleted inventories depending on economic factors. Glassman's faith is that the Fed will do a descent job in maintain the valuation of the dollar which means controlling inflation, adjusting interest rates, and maintain dollar hegemony against the euro and yen. The second assumption is that the stock market will continue to climb onward and upward eventually crossing 36,000 
Mr. "Dow 36,000" wants you to believe him this time. No, really, he means it. Right. In 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust. I think that's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust. This guy is amazing 
This is the BEST book written by Stephen King! I've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before I die 
I'm reviewing this as an afterthought. Of its genre "The Stand" is, without question the best. And the story is, in my opinion, the greatest Stephen King has done. I've read the other reviews and I won't go into specifics, however, if you enjoy reading end of it all types of stories you will love this book. Another reviewer complained about it being lengthy. Well, you don't have to read it to realize that. But the story and characters are original and well developed. The plot progresses smoothly to an exciting climax with lots of incredible things happening throughout. And I've read it three times 
Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.' I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop. The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
well i got screamed at by my mom for reading this book.she found out it was longer than the bible and got really fired up saying i shouldve read the bible.anyhow,the plot is simple.a doomsday plague is released killing near everyone.everyone left either gave visions from this old chick or a weirdo.its like the ultimate showdown between evil and good.............well thats what you are led to belive in 1800 plus pages of agonizingly meticulous details.then the end comes and it really sucks.i personaly think he had a deadline to meet or something and cut the book short.its hard to put down but its got its faults 
Before reading 'THE STAND' I'd only read a few novellas and the full length novel 'GERALD'S GAME' by Stephen King and was not all that impressed. However, after seeing the movie 'THE STAND' a few years ago and loving it, I decided to read the book that has been proclaimed by readers to be one of his best, and now I see why Mr. King has so many devotees. I must admit that the length of the book was a bit off putting for me in the beginning, I have never read a book quite as long as this one but I have found that most books that I've read that were on the lengthy side tended to be a bit slow and tedious. This was not at all the case with 'THE STAND' I practically flew through the novel not wanting to put it down! Stephen King's tale of the end of the world is an engrossing one that deals with the conflict between good and evil as well as real human issues. Also the character development in this novel is superb, one would tend to think that in a novel that deals with so many issues such as a "super-flu" that kills 99% of population, coping with the loss of loved ones, fighting for survival in a world with no rules, vivid nightmares of an ominous "Dark Man", an exhausting cross country trek, a pending fight between good and evil and trying to recreate civilization that there would be no room left for the characters to be fully developed but somehow King made it work. I did agree with some of the reviewers who said that the ending was a bit anti-climactic but the rest of the book was so well done that I do believe it still deserves every bit of the five stars I am giving it. I may be a little late jumping on this bandwagon, but I will now certainly be sure to pick up some of King's earlier works such as The Shining and IT in hopes that he will continue to live up to the hype! 
Seriously, King's always an incredible crafstman, his characters to die for, but of all of his novels (I've read most) this STANDS out as his classic great. Later novels just feel different, even if the voice and writing is always spectacular. The Stand is less polished, but more engaging on a number of fronts. Vivid, memorable scenes. I still remember Fran biting her tongue on the beach, of all things. Characters are always real -- and that's amazing in a fantasy epic. Normally, I look to escapism and fun in fantasy, but here, the characters feel so alive and real. My one thumbs down -- and it's not enough to bring this down to four stars -- is the expanded edition was not necessary. The original was expanded enough and just right. The new opening doesn't engage me like the old one with Stu in the garage, which is a real "Holy Crap" sort of opening. I once read where King griped about his fans saying his "best" book was such an old classic. But, hey, classic is classic. This is a triumph. The only weak point, to me, was the ending. It felt rushed. Maybe not as vivid as the rest. But it was all good, anyway. I recommend this to anyone who isn't susceptible to nightmares (it's more disturbing than scary, mind you. 
This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years it made me realize why did I try again??????? Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real? I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance. Coop only dates 20 something's. He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child. This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion". A bit too blasï¿½ for me. Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful sexy. I had a hard time getting into this premise. The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable. Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters. Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful look many years younger than they are. I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS. 
This is one of Danielle Steel's best books. It is about Cooper Winslow, a fading movie actor and lady's man who is in financial trouble. She develops the character of "Coop" well so it is easy to visualize him. Coop decides to rent out his "cottage" guest wings for $10,000 a month to two different tenants. The story centers around his new tenants, their romances, activities and children. In the end, Coop learns valuable lessons about sacrifice, giving to others and true love. A interesting story with a good message 
I had not read Danielle Steel in several years. I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable. I was very disappointed with this work 
Danielle Steele is a master artist at slowly piecing a book together, such as one of her better novels, The Cottage. This book consists of amazing characters that are split from the lives they once knew, and later are puzzled back together for a friendly meeting. Each main character, Jimmy, Mark, and Coop, are so different in their personalities but yet so much alike in their experiences. They cry, laugh, and just simply have fun when they are finally together. These three men share many similar situations throughout the novel and in the end, they all meet and talk about those certain happenings in each of their lives. How woman have left, cheated, and even passed away but they dealt with it and moved on. Luckily, they all found each other in their differences and similarities to be best friends. The capturing way Steele writes activates your emotions and slams your reality-way of thinking. She has a "happily-ever-after" touch to her writing and it takes your breathe away. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this selection and would reccomend it to anyone! Danielle Steele is truly a romantic genius 
This book has been helpful from the first day it arrived. As a first-time mom, I've found that it answers a lot of the questions I had - and some I didn't even think to ask! Much better than calling and bugging my busy doctor every other day 
I purchased this book for my daughter and daugher-in-law for their first babies born this year and they have found it so useful and regularly refer to it. Not only is it great for new mothers but as things have changed so much since my children were born Grandma has used it a lot as well. I first purchased What to Expect When You're Expecting by the same author and likewise it is a great book with lots of info 
The new mother tells me this book is great, a real handy reference. I gave it on the recommendation of another new Mom who said she wondered how she could have survived her first baby's first year without it. It's a great shower gift. Take it from the new mommies 
I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed. I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy. However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities. I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk. I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel. Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't." How is that helpful?!! After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy. In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother. 
This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do. But as a mom, who has time for this? Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible? Well, you won't find that here. This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style. The whole book is written in long paragraphs. There are very few tables or charts. IT's VERY wordy. Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation. It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age! More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"! I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" ! Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book 
This book is a MUST for any new parents! I have given this as a gift to every one of my pregnant friends and family 
An invaluable resource. Starting with "What to Expect when Your Expecting" through the "What to Expect the Toddler Years". Parent's should own them all. As a first time mom, I consult this book at least once a day 
Having had to wait 10 years because of infertility, I was so ready for children. When Jordan came into our lives, I had so many questions only this book could answer. I got to know the milestones a baby should come across, the things we as parents are to expect and the missing details that a pediatrician can't have time to dwell on because of the busy schedule he/she keeps. Have you ever experienced that? How many of us enjoy a visit to the pediatrician that spans 30 - 40 minutes? Not many. So this book helped. When our second child arrived miraculously (we were told that we could not have anymore), this book helped us once again to determine that because of missing milestones, we had to be concerned about our baby's mental and physical health. I highly recommend this book to new moms because if you can't remember to ask your doctor every question you had, ask the book. Read, read, read. It was our baby bible. And by the way, our first book has been passed around so many times. It has gone to another state in the USA, Hongkong, China and Singapore. And I just bought another one for a colleague. Enjoy the baby and the book 
This book provides a lot of great information for taking care of a new baby. A great counterpart to "what to expect when you're expecting. 
I was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature. Some of the pages were blank, having not even been printed. I figure the book was a total loss of money spent 
Sticking to the diet in the book I lost 35 lbs in five months. I find, interesting the fact that I can eat as much, or even more that I need as long as I keep the named proteins and carbs separate. This is the second copy of the book I have purchased and did so for my son and his family. He needs to lose about 20 pounds. I suggested that he follow the book suggestions very strickly and he should attain his goal 
I am about to get married in a year, and as usual, I am looking for any way I can to slim down for that perfect wedding dress. Just a few days ago, I was sluggish, and depressed after going on Jenny Craig and failing at it. I went on Jenny Craig at age 16 and was uncannily successful, almost 10 years later, I decided to try it again, but to no avail. It just didn't fit my life style anymore, and I had a REALLY hard time refraining from cheating, and incorporating resturaunt and "non-menu" meals to fit my plan. Don't get me wrong, Jenny Craig works very well if you stick to it, but my life has totally changed since 10th grade back in 1997. I found it hard to eat my packaged food, AND cook home cooked meals for my fianc'. On this plan, I have the best of both worlds. My fiance', who can't stand "diet" food, can eat these (not diet, but) modified meals with me!!! He has given me raves about every recipe I have cooked thus far from Suzanne's book! I can't get him to keep his hands off the grilled chicken before dinner is ready! Best of all, it has not even been a COMPLETE week, and I am already dropping pounds. I have lost atleast 5 or 6 pounds since buying this book last Friday 9-16-05. When I first flipped through the book and saw recipes like Chicken Piccata, Pepper Steak with Herb Butter Sauce, and Vegetables Provencal, I was like "uuummm NO!", but then I noticed how easy the instructions were, and how easy it would be to shop for the basic ingredients, which can be used in most of the other meals too. Now I feel like a whiz in the kitchen, making my own salad dressings, and hummus dip! I am utterly enamored with this way of eating because food combining is a virtually non-restrictive plan that I can follow for the rest of my life, and my family can enjoy these meals as well. I used to watch re-runs of Three's Company everyday after school as a child, who would have thought that, in the future, that woman playing the hilarious Chrissy Snow would be the person to introduce something to me that would change my life. This is not some pre-wedding crash diet, this is something that will extend well beyond that day. Thank you Suzanne! 
When buying a book of this type, buy it for the value of the information instead of the person who wrote it. Suzanne shares a method that worked for her, and she does it in a helpful, light-hearted, and humorous manner. Even if you don't believe in food combining, the approach and the recipes are still quite helpful. If you're serious about losing weight - and have tired everything else on the market - your success with this program will be 100% up to you and your determination to achieve your goals. I think it's worth buying 
I lost 20lbs in 2 weeks. this weekend I had custard (made with heavy cream). She is AWESOME. In 2 more weeks I'll be under 300lbs. I love you, Suzanne 
I've been reading about weight management programs for the past 4 years. I love reading about the human body and better ways to "fuel" it. So, I signed up for what I thought to be the best plan on the market, Weight Watchers. They have that new "whole foods" plan. As someone who eats salads everyday for lunch, I thought the plan was tough! I couldn't stick with it. I constantly had food cravings. I gave up after 3 weeks and never used the rest of my "meeting" tickets. What to do next..... At work, my co-worker looks great so I asked her what she does. We were eating lunch at the Macaroni Grill and she ordered a huge bowl of wheat pasta with veggies. It looked so good. And, she grabbed a piece of the fresh bread on the table. I asked how she could eat that and look so good. She said she's been applying Suzanne Somer's weight management strategy. I was like, "Really? What's that?". She explained the basic guidelines of Food Combing. It sounded simple enough. So, I started reading about Food Combining on-line and the concept made sense. The very next day I went to Barnes and Noble and bought a copy of this particular book. She does have other books, but I thought this one gave the best explanation of the plan since I'm a new-be. I've only been on this plan for a couple days, but I feel really good. No more indigestion, no more feeling stuffed. I feel great. And the best part, I don't get hungry and there are no cravings. Why? Because I haven't really cut out anything, just rearrange when I eat it. Combining foods makes sense. Different foods (carbs vs fats) need different enzymes in the body to digest them. If they are eaten in groups, the body can effortlessly digest them. And, if you're thinking it's not a healthy plan because she's not a doctor, you're wrong. Since vegetables on this plan can be eaten with both carbs and fats, I find myself eating more veggies and fruits than I ever did before. Even more exciting, this is not Atkins, so you are not eating fat all the time. For example, a typical dinner could be grill salmon with two fresh veggies as sides. I had that last night for dinner and it was delicious. You will be getting your carb fix and feel completely satisfied at the same time. I'm a cereal eater and had a bowl with milk a couple minutes ago. If you have any doubt, don't. I'm serious. The book is only $16 in the store, on Amazon probably less. If you just follow the general guidelines you'll lose weight. Yes, this plan may be "similar" to other plans, but she has streamlined it so you feel comfortable with your body and the idea of losing weight. I guess it's all about presentation. I'm actually excited about this plan. I honestly feel like my search is over.  
The problem with biographies of Marlon Brando, and celebrities in general, is that they are often written by an outsider, someone who had little or no personal acquaintance with the subject and is sometimes just out to cash in on their celebrity. It is these problems with most biographies that makes George Englund's biography of Marlon Brando such a joy to read. Englund's friendhip with Brando started in 1956 and his biography therefore thrusts us directly into the height of his fame and spares us the date and details of his birth and upbringing. These often constitute the more tedious parts of other biographies. Another common problem with biographies is that they have a tendency to simply list off the actions and professional achievements of their subjects, sometimes giving them the appearance of a prolonged C.V. This is another area where Englund's book comes into its own. His close relationship with Brando allows him to recount many very personal and revealing tales that allow the reader to feel a closeness to Marlon that is difficult considering how private a man he was. The difficulties of Brando's life are well documented, but the accounts offered here are far more vivid and moving. The writer is not pre-occupied with sensationalism or scandal, merely the real story and the emotion felt. 'The way it's never been done before' is a fascinating read and is a must have for anyone that is passionate about the work of Marlon Brando, surely the screen's greatest ever acto 
George Englund's memoir of Marlon Brando is that, a memoir and far from a full-scale biography. It is a touching remembrance, filled with genuine affection for its subject, but not so much as to make the author blind to the shortcomings and warts of the greatest of all our film actors. In its affection it is a welcome departure from some of the more vicious tabloid-like portrayals of Brando--Peter Manso's biography comes to mind. At its best Englund's work is distinguished by some really beautiful interludes and gripping passages--his description of visiting his own absentee father after decades is especially moving. One senses that Englund believed he was privy to the whole of Brando, the insider of all insiders. His graphic description of Brando's last night is almost an exercise in trying to prove to himself, and us, how close he was to Brando. And it is a rare occurrence of Englund going perhaps too far. But for all that he was allowed to see, it is also apparent to the reader, if not to Englund himself, that Georgie was kept at arms length from various facets and compartments of his famous subject. There are dramatic and notable gaps in the book, and one gets the feeling that Englund's import as a macho and intellectual sidekick grew once Wally Cox died. It is perhaps too much to ask any single book to cover the whole of Brando--the subject is simply too complex. But this is a useful glimpse inside at least some aspects of Brando's life. 
Good book, but I have one major reservation: In an interview, George Englund said he penned this account of Marlon Brando with, "Brando's dignity in my hand". So presumptively, Englund as a best friend wouldn't think to ever reveal personal information or details that Brando would have never wanted known, right? Isn't that what best friends are for? Um, quite the contrary here: Englund's telling of Brando's last days were too dam detailed, at times vile and completely unnecessary. Surely, this is not what people want to remember of the revered legend. I'm unafraid to say that I wept on the day Brando died like I had lost someone I knew and loved. For fans who really loved him a good portion of this thing -in excruciating pain from his disease and lying in helpless condition on a deathbed- you will find incredibly depressing. I'd recommend skipping some parts if you wanna keep the image of Brando the Almighty One intact. Dark clouds away this was indeed a pure delight to pore through... when is the subject ever boring afterall? I was happy Mr.Englund released this very personal tale of his friendship with Brando I only wish the actor himself were still alive to admire even more. 
This is a sad and poignant memoir and a fine companion piece to Brando's autobiography. I wondered while reading it why Mr. Englund wasn't mentioned by name in the autobiography, but that is made clear toward the end of Mr. Englund's work. A few comments regarding the handful of negative reviews on this site. Brando's legacy as a great actor is not diminished in any way by some of the brutal revelations regarding his personal life. Perhaps a few sordid details could have been left out but I never got the sense that they were thrown in out of a sense of animus directed at Brando. In fact what comes through repeatedly is the author's deep affection for his subject, a mutual bond that was forged through their shared misfortune at having self-absorbed and destructive fathers. To their credit they achieved great material and artistic success in spite of the psychological burdens they both stuggled with throughout their lives. Now, as for the book itself. There is one chapter dealing with Mr. Englund's relation to his father that is absolutely riveting. Not only did I find it so but Brando himself was absorbed in this story, seeing as it touched on the same issues at the core of his own personality. There are also numerous other anecdotes that shed light on the main question: who is Marlon Brando, what is he really like when the veil of his movie star personna is lifted. In many respects it's a sad picture. It's the classic case of the mistreated child who grows up to perpetuate the wrongs that were once unfairly inflicted on him. As for his acting, he was able to overcome all obstacles and develop his great talent, though there's no doubt that the fuel that fired him was drawn from the well of his bitter early years 
Marlon Brando once said that his friends don't write books about him. So what does that make Englund? Marlon said about Carlo Fiore, a once questionable so-called friend, that he probably wrote his book about Marlon because that's all he had left. The same seems to apply to Englund. I mean, why describe the gory details of Marlon's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon? Seriously, would a real 'friend' have done such a thing? Why not leave us with some glorious memory of Marlon as a true friend would. I mean, without the help of Englund's book, Marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes, inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today. Why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the Brando legend? If Marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma (why we love him), and I believe he did it on purpose, what gives this so-called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows Marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend? He's a sell-out jerk to me, but that's just my opinion. Would Alice Marchak (Marlon's assistant) or Jocelyn (Marlon's sister) ever write a book about Marlon? I don't think so. And they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something, anything about Marlon. They didn't because people who truly love you don't do that. Englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever, but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life, but not at all in death. That is the lowest of all the slimballs because Marlon probably died thinking this sell-out was his friend. NOT!!! Now that I think about it, while this guy is trying to make everybody think that once Marlon had made his peace with him he could go on and die now, Marlon, in all his glorious brilliance to the end, may have set this guy up, knowing his greed would lead him to go public with Marlon's backside and dung details and show what a jerk he is. Now that sounds like a Marlon prank, being transparent and naked enough even in his darkest hour to expose the greed that lied in this so-called lifelong friend's heart. Obviously Marlon knew Englund and that he wasn't a friend. Marlon knew Englund would prove his greed, along with his disloyalty, by making the stupid choice of painting for the world such a gory picture of Marlon's last night when Marlon was brilliant enough and deserved better from a "FRIEND". The ultimate acting icon pulling the ultimate set-up. Way to go Marlon! You were a genius to the end. I see clearly, this bum for what he is. Englund said that even on his death bed Marlon said "F death". Well I say even on his death bed Marlon said "F You Georgie". 
A REAL downer. I realize Marlon Brando's life had many sadnesses, but this book really seemed to dwell on them. Mr Englund told of how HE thought. I wanted to hear how Mr Brando thought. The ending really ticked me off...I saw no need for the story of Butch, the dog. A TOO SAD story. I do agree with the review by Book Review Weekly. 
I believe that Mr. Englund has set a new standard on how biographies should be written. He showed us a side of Marlon that should be included in every biography, and so rarely is.I also applaud Mr. Englund's passion as a true friend. In this wonderful book, he has shown what a REAL friend is, which is something that most of us can only aspire to 
George Englund's book is the product of 50 years of a friendship with Marlon Brando, the lives of two men and their families intertwined, loving and suffering through the best and worst times. His book portrays the pain and grief of loss, the exultation of success, and the double-edge of fame and reality. George's book goes beyond the commonplace biography, and digs down deep. I recommend reading it 
This book comes straight from the heart. As 3rd son of author George Englund, I, George Englund Jr. am closer my dad than anyone else. I grew up with Marlon and his children; Christian, Miko, and Cheyenne. I spent time with them all in Tahiti on his atoll and worked with Marlon on several projects directly and extensively. Before giving my review on the book I must comment on the Publisher's Weakley review which misses the mark almost completely. This book was intentionally non-chronological, is in no way an attempt to document Brando's career or establish his place in film history. That is another book which I truly hope my father writes and one for which he is eminently qualified. GE Sr. was arguably Marlon's closest lifelong friend and this book is his truth about their relationship and his deepest most honest perception of who Marlon was. It was finished in an insanely compressed schedule after Marlon's death requiring the author to balance the bereavement of a lost best friend with the pressure of writing a serious comprehensive book with an extremely limited deadline. Contrary to the Publishers Weekly author, I found that Englund's take was consistently un-self centered and reflected the reality of their experiences. They are both spectacularly talented in different and similar ways. The reviewer mentioned that GE Sr.s career was never fully developed....That is an ignorant statement. It was the opposite of an ego trip. The Publishers Weekly review claimed that the narration ruled out any multi-layered insight but their shared experiences illustrate a deep and complex picture of two highly unique guys sharing a rare set of experiences. Brando was accurately revealed in this book and Englund appropriately represented his role and stature. Imagine if you had to write a book about your best friend, the greatest actor in the world, within 30 days of his death. I'm a hard grader on my dad but I think he kicked ass on this one big time. It is honest, fair and balanced 
"Ark Angel" is my first go at an Alex Rider novel. Even without reading the five preceding books, I enjoyed this one for what it is: a spy novel for young adults. Horowitz jumps right into the new story and explains previous plot lines enough for the reader to keep up. There is virtually no character development or exploration; there are constant plot twists and turns. Whether this is a positive or negative probably depends upon the reader. If the reader is looking for a character to identify with, to journey with, to aspire to, Alex is a bit thin. If the reader wants rollicking excitement without bogging down, this could be a good vein to mine. "Ark Angel" reminds me of the theatrical "Mission: Impossible" films: action driven, violent, uncomplicated. "Three Days of the Condor" or "Manchurian Candidate" it isn't. While Horowitz isn't among the top tier of Young Adult Fiction writers (J.K. Rowling, Robert Cormier, Lloyd Alexander, Gary Paulsen, Laurie A. Williams come to mind, but there are many more) but he's a competent craftsman who has extended Ian Fleming's 007 to a younger, contemporary audience. I imagine that fans of Horowitz might eventually graduate to richer material 
Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series. As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space. Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead 
Other than Stormbreaker, this may be the next best Alex Rider adventure yet. In some ways the plot is predictable as all Alex Rider stories are - except for the ending surprise in Scorpia. The action is fast paced and is perfect for a teenage boy reader. Girls who enjoy spy stories will like it too. It is hard to put the book down. 
This is the same classic Alex Rider adventure. One of the better ones in the series but Scorpia is still the best 
Alex Rider is by far the thriftiest boy I know! Horowitz is a great writer and can make the best descriptions! I enjoy reading his books very much. 
in this thrilling addition to the Alex Rider series, Alex is in the hospital, recovering from a near shave with a sniper bullet, courtesy of Scorpia. While in the hospital, he befriends the friendless Paul Drevin, the son of a multi-millionaire. One night, as Alex was walking down the hallway, he saw the receptionist shot, and heard that the shooters were after Paul.Alex tricks the kidnappers into thinking he's Paul, and then leads them through the hotel, zapping one of them in the neck with defibullators, knocks another one out with a medicine ball, and tricks a man with a solid metal watch into walking into a room with an incredibly powerful magnet. That wasn't pretty. But he fergot about the fourth guy. He's captured and brought back to the headquarters of the kidnappers, who are actually the members of a terrorist oraganization, Force Three. And so it goes, with a brilliant escape from a burning building, a awsome go-kart race, a meeting with the CIA, a private island, a huge space hotel, rigged to come hurtliing down to our very own Washinton D.C. The Alex Rider series gets better with every new installment, and I can't wait for another one to come out. It's hands down the best spy series around. I would recommend this book to every one who can read or be read to 
I have read all the books of this series. This is really good. i mean i didnt like the ending much but besides that Anthony Horowitz is a great author 
I assigned this text almost unseen as a course book because it included so many of the classic essays which one might have ended up xeroxing. The students found the book very useful. I would have liked a more historical focus but that's because of my own training. I will assign the book again 
Through this book Charles M. Province has complied the very best there is in leadership. Read and learn....... This collection of George S. Patton's pithy one liners shows how business managers can successed by applying the combat-tested principles of one of America's most famous battlefield leaders. General Patton was a professional soldier who spent his life inspiring people to accomplish the seemingly impossible. A brief bio &amp; photos of the General help readers visualize one of the great military leaders of all time. The inspirational content will make this book an indispensable companion for busy executives everywhere 
This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie "Patton" based on Ladislas' book. It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man. Connecting Patton to Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two men. Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be idolized. He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over the men he lost. Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make today 
There is much to enjoy here even if one does not have a special interest in architecture. As a lifelong Chicagoan, I especially liked the photo of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (p. 79) which occurs in the formerly Polish neighborhood that I grew up in. I also enjoyed the old maps of the Chicago area from the 1600's. 
In Lost Chicago, historian David Lowe explores the architectural and cultural history of America's great "heartland" city. This is a community who architectural heritage was all to often squandered during the last five decades of its growth and evolution. Lowe's elegant, and informative text is wonderfully enhanced with more than 270 rare, period photos and prints (many of them published here for the first time). Lost Chicago is a celebration of the age of Gustavus Swift and Philip D. Armour and the greatest stockyards in the world; when Cyrus McCormick, Potter Palmer, George Pullman, and Marshall Field were the national barons of business and industry; when Prairie Avenue and State streets rivaled New York's Fifth Avenue; when architectural giants ranging from Louis Sullivan to Frank Lloyd Wright were designing buildings of incomparable excellence and innovation. Lost Chicago is a "must" for students of Chicago history, architecture, and personalities 
First issued in 1975, this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of Chicago's architecture that has been destroyed (by nature and man). Today Chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel (and it is, I live there!) but after reading this book you won't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the Urban Renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened. If you are interested in architecture, Chicago history or urban design and planning, read this book 
I had a little difficulty getting this book, but I'm glad that I did finally find it. It is a wonderful mystery, even though the subject behind the mystery is disturbing. I know that I knew about research done on live animals, but I never thought about with dogs somehow. I pictured lab rats and mice. It goes against everything that I believe in to use our domestic best friends for product testing and experiments. But the mystery was good, and I enjoyed Holly and her friends again. Ms. Conant knows how to write a story while she bravely uncovers some less than desirable facts about big business. This is a wonderful series for dog lovers, or for any animal lovers if it comes to that 
Holly Winter returns in the 2nd book in the Dog Lover's Mysteries. Holly writes articles for A Dog's Life, trains at the local obedience club, shows her dog in obedience, and works to find the dognappers of her dog and her father's wolf. Her Malamute, Rowdy, plays a starring role in this book that takes a strong look at testing on animals. I was not the same after reading this book. I have to admit that after reading it, I started looking more closely at the labels on packaging that say "Not Tested on Animals". This was not a preachy book, but brought to light some shocking things done to animals at some testing facilities. I consider myself an animal lover and was haunted by this book after reading it. Not exactly a lighthearted read, but it was worth it. The first book in this series is "A New Leash on Death". Enjoy! 
Ms. Conant constantly amazes me with her ability to weave dog info into mystery. Anyone who has ever shown a dog had had to deal with a gossipy trainer/handler/owner and few wouldn't like to take a pair of shears to one of them as well! I adore this book and highly suggest you get a copy 
To read Sir Charles is to read about life without the pompous filter you get with most other pap. This installment is no different from anything else from Lord Chinaski. 
With Bukowski there is no middle ground; you either love him or you hate him. Yes he can be filthy, jaded and downright mean. But there is the ring of truth here as well. Published posthumously this is a feast for Bukowski fans. There are a lot of dark poems here like Walking with the Dead and Return to Sender. But there is also some lighthearted stuff. In The Fool Dines Out he shows us his human side; he is the husband whose rude behavior towards a waiter brings on spousal criticism (in private of course) He has been accused of being a misogynist; in Bone Palace Ballet there is no evidence of that. Bukowski was a bit of a misanthrope, or did he just see the human condition a whole lot clearer than the rest of us? A must have for any Bukowski fan! 
Bukowski in his last years. Rare to see a writer grapple with aging and death in such a matter of fact way. There are some true gems in this one. .... Bone Palace is a little repetitive, but you can't be shocked to find Bukowski holding forth on booze, women, horses, hypocrites, and writing. What else did he ever write about? And really, what more can you ask for 
This book is only a shadow of what Bukowski can do. I was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work. These poems are all ones that he would have never released had he been alive. They have no charm and show nothing of his talent. His wife I guess thought they were good enough to be released. I beg to differ. If you want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check out Betting on the muse which is an amazing book 
All About Grilling, is a refreshing book of new ideas for outdoor cooking and entertaining. I was very impressed with the different combinations of ingredients, the presentation of the meal, the grilled side dishes, and the rubs and sauces. I received the book as a gift and have enjoyed using it for my summer entertaining. I am now purchasing a book for a friend 
"Catch Me If You Can" follows the life of Frank W. Abignale - one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was. This book is the autobiographical account of Abignale's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father's Mobil credit card. There are so many times in this book that I had to step back and think about the air of confidence that Abignale displayed, yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him. Some of the stories are absolutely outrageous. I loved them all! This book also talks about his time in prison across seas in Europe and how terrible he was treated in the French prisons. If you liked the movie then you should definately read this book. It further explores his adventures and exploits in greater detail and includes many capers that were not in the movie. A must read 
This book was very well written and so much fun to read. Frank Abagnale tells his story with the same flare and finesse that he pulled off the cons of his criminal career. Entertaining from start to finish 
We all know of Frank Abagnale's personality; arrogant, yet kind with class. Among all the different characters that he chooses to play, whether he's a pilot, doctor, lawyer, or a college professor, i believe that Frank is somewhat confused of who he is. Frank "ran away" from home at 16; the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school. At 16, most people don't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future. One thing was for sure; Frank wanted money and women. I believe Frank's unique personality came from the way he was brought up. Having endured his parent's divorce at a young age was a life changing experience for him. It all started with his father; Frank Abagnale. During the process of his(Jr.'s) parent's divorce, his father still loved is mother. So Frank(Sr.) would try to get his son to say things like "Talk to her son...tell her I love her. Tell her we'd be happier if we all lived together. Tell her you'd be happier if she came home, that all you kids would be happier." His(Jr's) father led him to the first step of manipulation. Frank stayed with his father after the finalizing of the divorce. Since his father was quite a rich man, he had a whole variety of rich friends and Frank(Jr.) would come in contact with his friends quite often. This is where Frank learned the "attitude of the rich", with confidence. Finally when Frank did his first con with his father's money, Frank(Sr.) forgave him. "Look, son, if you'll tell us how you did this, and why, we'll forget it. There'll be no punishments and I'll pay the bills." Frank probably felt that he could get away with anything at this point and without any punishment, he didn't believe this to be a huge mistake. With confidence, manipulation, some class and little fear of breaking the law, we come to Frank Abagnale Jr. 
Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
If you, like me, have seen the film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book, you are reading the right review! If you were in front of me, I would look at you with a grin (as if to show that I knew something you didn't) and encourage you to do so. Frank Abagnale is less likable in the book, which is to be expected, but is still far from what we would consider a true villain. It caught me by surprise about halfway through how I was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values. I suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy. Overall, a fun read that may possibly help you appreciate the film even more 
I read this book after watching the movie (staring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio). Before I started I knew I liked the story, but I didn't realize how much. I loved reading Abagnale's account of his life of crime. I enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot, a doctor, a professor, and a lawyer. I also liked the novel's open frankness about the author's misdeeds. However, I thought the book was not especially well written. Abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion. I also felt somewhat deprived with the novel's ending. Frank Abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms, but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story. I would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right. All in all, I would recommend this book as an easy weekend read 
Many people became aware of Frank Abagnale Jr's story until the movie starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicapprio was released (even though an earlier movie based on this story was released). While not as flowing as the movie, the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life, containing many of Abagnale's earlier mistakes lessons we don't get to see in the movie. On the other hand, many parts of it do seem to be missing - such as why Air France would take such an interest in catching Frank, even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly American based? This is an interesting read as a background to the movie, and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie's major storylines 
Not a reader of fiction, fantasy, sci-fi... therefore picked up a copy of "Catch Me If You Can" from a bookstore yesterday... Seen the film more than 10times.. loved the film, loved the characters, loved the plot... LOVED the book even more... can't put it down... the story just flows perfectly... Makes you wonder what Franky can do at the age of 16,17 etc. A real inspiration... the book's plot is BY-FAR better than the movie... Would have been great to read it before watching the film.. still good to read it after watching the film.. Overall, it's a great book finished it in a da 
Ideal for anyone with an interest in evading capture 
This book helped me focus my mind on my weight loss. I lost 65 lbs. and have kept it off for a year now. I am buying multiple copies for my friends and relatives! The psychology of permanent weight loss is the most important thing, and this book really helped me change my way of thinking about food and exercise 
Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in they forgot they were from different planets. Based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus has helped millions of couples transform their relationships. Now viewed as a modern classic, this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn't arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow. Don't be too surprised when you are reading this book and you recognize someone and some situation that is eerily like your own 
If you are young, under 30, this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex. If you are older, this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned (or things that you missed) in the school of everyday life. For both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others. 
This book has really good advice and insight that makes sense. The only downside is that the references to "martians" and "venusians" gets annoying after awhile 
Very intuitive, well written, reader voice is a bit annoying but tolerable 
F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
This book not only explains the differences between men and women but also gives strategies to each sex for dealing with those differences. For example men and women have different values. Men tend to value competence and accomplishments while women tend to value relationships. Women tend to express their caring by offering unsolicited advice that is often causes men to feel incompetent. Women need to express how they feel about their problems, while men interpret this as blaming them for their problems. Men often need time alone to solve their problems while women interpret this as not caring. If everyone practiced the methods in this book the sexes would get along much better. The book, however, is at times dry reading. Wil Roese 
There are varying differences between men and women and Mr. Gray takes his time in this book to explain what they are. What I got from it was a new perspective, a new way to understanding what needs to be understood--how to interact with the opposite sex. What's most important is to take the time to actually listen without formualing what you're going to say next. I can see why this book is so popular now. Along with this one, I also recommend "Man Magnet. 
Once in a while a book speaks so strongly to so many people, that it does the impossible. It is popular and worthwhile. The best part is that this book gives simple pragmatic execrcises to change communication for the better. Get the book and stay married. Another great reading that I recommend is "In the meantime" by Vanzan 
This book has become so popular that terminology from this book has entered our popular culture (calling a woman a Venusian, for example). But my opinion is that this is well earned and hopefully a plus for helping men and women understand one another. Some criticism leveled at this book is that it is too general, and to say "men are like this and women are like that" is a disservice to both, poppycock I say! It's refreshing to read a book that may help you understand the "general" psychological and linguistic make up of an "average" man or woman. I find this type of reading far more useful than all the cultural relativism that has bogged down our understanding of each other, where we seem afraid to look at groups as, just that, groups. Men are a group and thus have certain statistically average traits. This is supported in Gray's book by very revealing comments from his seminars. The basic premise of this book is to help "decode" the opposite sex's langauge. E.g. when a man says "it's ok," it means "I want to figure this out on my own and I'd rather you didn't offer unsoliticed advice; that makes me feel you don't trust me." When a woman says "it's ok," it usually means "I am really upset and I need you to pull this conversation out of me. I am going to withdraw now because I feel you are not trying to understand me and I need to see you take action before I can begin to trust you and feel more loving again." I have found some of Gray's suggestions to be very helpful. When asking my BF "will you" instead of "can you," I find I am very satisfied with how things go when I ask "will," which gives him choice to say "yes or no," rather than "can" which many men interpret as being demanding and without choice. These subtle distinctions can be quite mind blowing when you first read about them, but start putting them into practice or observing how men and women typically communicate and the words they use, and you will find Gray's observations to be very helpful. I am very happy I read this book. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine and I have gone on to recommend it to other friends. It really does serve as a sort of "pocket reference guide" to the opposite sex, and it is empowering and liberating to realize that we are linguistically completely different. When we better know how the other communicates, it is then that we can transcend our differences and begin to communicate truly as equals. I recommend this book without reservation. 
Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender, and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
The book chronicles tidy snapshots of the lives and careers of 4 different men whose influence in corporate regulation remains unrivaled. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Brandeis. It is terribly unfortunate to contemporary American society that a man like Justice Louis Brandeis is not still alive and a sitting judge with the Supremes. Brandeis's intellect and legacy puts the 9 slugs currently sitting on the bench to shame. 
A young woman and her son are murdered and their home burned down. The man who did it gets caught in the fire and ends up in the hospital. The woman's brother, Joe Lassiter, a professional investigator, begins to probe into why his sister and nephew were killed. It all leads him to 17 other women and their young sons, all conceived at the same fertility clinic, who have been murdered in the exact same circumstances. The man who killed Lassiter's sister, escapes from the hospital with the help from members of a strange sect of Catholocism called Umbra Domini who appear to be behind the killings. Lassiter must go to Italy and investigate the odd doctor who conceived the children and what he was trying to achieve. The Genesis Code is a quick read. The pace is fast and non-stop. It's an interesting plot although this territory has been mined in many other novels. And after you read about the doctor and consider the title of the book you know the secret pretty much from the beginning. Despite this, if you like fast-paced thrillers, The Genesis Code is a good one 
This book is a great book, don't get me wrong, but has a slow beginning, slow enough that I actually became discouraged and thought about putting the book away, but once the book really gets going it is thrilling and very fast paced. If you can make it through the initial crawl and into the heart of the book you will not, at all, be disappointed for sticking with this novel. The concept of this book is fairly simple; something in the scientific world is being done that the church strongly disproves of, enough disproval that it drives them to kill. The victims are all the same: a mother and a male child under the age of 4. The victims that are targeted all have one thing in common, they all went to a clinic that was doing top of the end research and was very successful at allowing those that were infertile or too old the possibility to have children. The clinic helps out those who want to carry children and are otherwise deemed untreatable, and also carrying out research that could alter the world forever, an extremely delicate subject that threatens to change the way our entire history, as human beings, is viewed. Through the whole debacle many lives are lost in hope of protecting something deemed sacred. The thing that is terrifying about this book is that it COULD actually happen. The idea is fairly far fetched but, in some discreet lab I could actually see research of this kind unfolding. The fact that John Case dreamed up the idea shows that maybe others out there have thought, or even tried this idea out. The epilogue of this book is just fantastic, and could actually lead to the writing of a second in the series, something that would have the potential to be far superior to its predecessor. Overall I really did like this book, a book that opened my eyes to the writing of John Case, something I look forward to exploring in the future. Brian Bowe 
Has it been so long? 1998?? This is one of the first books that I reviewed on the internet - I was asked to write it, and made me a John Case fan - This book deals with a fertiliy clinic that has amazing donors - and the plans from the church to stop it. The last page is a catch your breath ending. A stranger in a local bookstore asked me if I'd ever read John Case - he was happy I knew the book. I was proud of that first review - and still like to dabble in writing. Of course books like Case's make it easy - 
This book is one of the five best I have ever read. It is very thourough and in our scientific world, who knows? READ THIS BOOK 
This book rests entirely on one idea, with which you are teased from the very beginning. By the middle, it can be pretty much guessed, but you still have a long way to go before the last sentence finally confirms your worst suspicions. The fact that the main character is the head of the most powerful investigative agency on the planet is also a spoiler, because he can too easily get what he needs at every twist and turn. A further aspect that irritated me was the fact that the authors (a couple, writing under one name) made several mistakes about things Italian (Italy is where a good deal of the book takes place), all of which could have been easily researched. I might be too demanding considering that this is meant for pure entertainment, but even when I read non-scholarly books, I expect some attention to detail. I seriously doubt that I will ever pick out a John Case again. 
I just finished reading this book and WOW! It was great! I really had trouble putting it down. The plot was very convincing and I just loved the ending. There was a surprise on every page including the last page. As a writer, the two things I was most impressed with (in addition to the wonderful plot) was how Case created such a sense of place - I really felt like I was there in every scene and I could really visualize the space. I also thought he did such a good job of nailing the dialogue - each character sounded different, one could imagine someone speaking English as a second language, yet it was not difficult to read. I thought the information about the relics in the Catholic church was especially interesting and also, all the technical cloning stuff made me realize that this entire plot is not so far-fetched. It would make a great movie 
I use to read Grisham and Patterson before they got irritating and Case puts them to shame. I loved this book, the idea was amazing - cloning from... well, I can't tell you because that will spoil it. I would highly recommend this compared to Eighth Day which was not that great. I know it may have seemed that the characters are like countless others in these types of books, but I still liked the story and the end gave me some chills 
The Genesis Code:A Thriller by John Case, is a today's thriller, it could have been written for today or tomorrow. Reads very much true to life. People Beware! There is someone waiting around each and every corner 
This calendar features some of Alex Ross's best paintings and action figures, from January to December there is a year full of heros 
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans. 
To call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the Genius Alex Ross is not presented in chronological order, but rather starts with the most popular characters Superman, Batman, etc., and then moves on to other work such as Justice League of America, Kingdom Come, Alan Moore, etc. Alex Ross is arguably the greatest visual artist of our time. As far as I am concerned his work is up there with Picasso, Da Vinci and Degas. This book takes the reader in a character-and event-based journey of Alex Ross's incredible work. What Ross and this book have in common are the incredible attention to detail and color. The art presented in this book is so rich in color it is almost unreal. The pictures carry unbelievable detail, down to the pores on the faces of the Superman and Batman sculptures. I have never seen such a visual fest in any other comic or movie-related book, I guarantee you you will not be disappointed, it doesn't even matter whether you are a comic book fan or not. Ross's modern day interpretation in the recreation of the art work from 40s, 50s and 60s comic book covers is so nostalgic and professional it makes you appreciate his talent even more. This is one book not to miss. The print quality is extremely high, and pictures carry a ridiculous amount of detail and color. Especially if you are a Superman or Batman fan, you are on for a treat as they are most prominently featured in this book. This is one great book, I have always been a huge Alex Ross fan, but thanks to this book I now feel like I know him personally (through his art presented in this book as well as the narration in the text that accompanies the pictures). One last note: Get the hardcover if you can, the art work on the sleeve is much better than the paperback cover, and the art work on the front and back of the hard cover book is simply incredible 
DC comics fans who love comic art collections must have MYTHOLOGY: THE DC COMICS ART OF ALEX ROSS: it's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters Ross' art brought to life over the decades, from Superman and Flash to Green Lantern. Included also is Ross' new comic book series Justice, new sketches, and an oversized coffee-table format which helps display and profile, in full color, Ross' entire line of DC Comics superheroes. An original Superman and Batman story written by graphic designer Chip Kidd, a re-telling of Robin's origin written by Paul Dini, plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover MYTHOLOGY appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own. 
got it as a present for my boyfriend. he loved it. really nice cover that folds out 
I couldn't believe, but mr.Ross did it again!Even better!The second edition of the hardcover edition is even better than the first one! The cover is already a gem! You have to see to believe it!Not to mention the extra amount of pages of new art and updated material!Go for it!AAA+++ 
This is the perfect gift for the comic book fan who has every comic book. Also, looks great on a coffee table 
This book was so impressive we were glad we bought it for our friend! She loves it, and didn't put it down all day after receiving it 
More an inside in Ross' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters... beautiful boo 
This book will astonish you even before you open it. The jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of DC, Superman and Batman, and below the jacket you'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every DC superhero battling versus their respective villains. With an introduction from M Night Shyamalan, the book presents Alex from his early beginnings as a child trying to create comic book characters and how his mother kind of influenced him (even though he affirms this didn't happen, take a look at her mom's works and try to believe him) He then presents the DC characters one by one (the Batman session has some pages dedicated to the Joker only, no other villains are shown), the early drawings, original artwork from classics and the homage he has paid for covers, posters or special editions. Analysis on the symbols and the myths of each character are used to describe what Ross wants to project with his images. I don't think it necessary to mention which character has the larger amount of pages dedicated to himself only. You get to see in drawings the creative process he follows when creating a piece, the ideas scratched on a piece of paper, the drawings and possible posing and then the final image. There are pictures I has never seen until I got this book, when I first saw them my fisrt thought was ` I need to frame these', which came up as a bad idea as I would have had to frame the entire book. The abandoned ideas for `Portraits of villainy' are presented here in the form of pencil sketches that look pretty well, it is hard to imagine how they would have looked if the project had been completed. His takes on Hanna-Barbera, Mad magazine, Alan Moore, the animated style and World's finest are also present. Then there are pages and pages dedicated to 'Kingdom Come', from the early concepts and ideas, passing through sketches until the realization of the project. The possible prequel that never occurred, `The Kingdom' is also mentioned and the preliminary sketches by Ross are shown. Uncle Sam is also analyzed near the end of the book in the same way the other projects previously were. Then we have this section called `The process', in which we obviously get to see how Alex works using the book's cover as example. The final part of the book is a very nice bonus, a Batman/Superman special story written by Chip Kidd and Alex Ross created exclusively for this book. Indeed a great piece of collection, this book is a must for comic book fans. The hard cover presentation, the paper in which it is printed and the bonus stuff are worth the price to pay. 
To my mind, this is the best of Michael Lewis's work. His style and observations show the humor and zing that have become his hallmark, and his writing is at top form. Next examines the changes wrought by the Internet from the perspective of several entrepreneurs who have exploited its potential, mainly in the form of vignettes. There is no beginning, middle or end, so if you're looking for a story with a plot line, this is likely not going to appeal to you. The lack of story line is, however, what I found compelling - the theme of the book is, "There's this 1800-pound bull out there that everyone is studying and avoiding, and here are a few folks who have ventured out and ridden the bull and had great rides." This is pretty much quintessential Michael Lewis - he finds an individual, or an event, or an industry that has fomented a paradigm shift (a deliberate choice of words here, since Moneyball dealt with the emergence of SABRmetrics, whose acolytes all seem to have read "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"). 
Not a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read. 
Michael Lewis has an almost unique talent for providing one with an intuitive feel for a subject while simultaneously making you laugh out loud. I think I learned more about Wall Street from "Liar's Poker" than all the great serious tomes I've read, while at the same time enjoying it as pure farce, and yet I was left with an increased respect for the people and institutions. How is that even possible? After "Liar's Poker" I needed to read more of Mr. Lewis, but I avoided "Next" for a long time because the internet is my "Wall Street", a place with which I am intimately familiar. Non-technical books on the subject thus tend to annoy me, as I keep picking out nits where I feel the dilettante has gotten something wrong or missed the point. Boy, did I underestimate Michael Lewis. "Next" is as brilliant as "Liar's Poker", hilarious and incredibly informative. He intuitively captures the significance of the Internet: the way it breaks down all the old silos of expertise and authority and distributes them into the homes of everyone. The best part is probably the description of Jonathan Lebed, the 15-year online trader charged with securities fraud by the SEC...and the complete inability of the SEC to come to grips with the absurdity of the situation. 
Next: The Future Just Happened is about how the internet is changing the world. Lewis profiles Jonathan Lebed, a teenage stock market wizard (the SEC says he was a stock market manipulator -- Lewis isn't so sure); a teenage law expert who has never studied law; a teenager in England who is using Gnutella software as a springboard to, I don't know, take over the world, I guess. It seems obvious from the first half of the book that teenage boys are using the internet to become rich, powerful, and influential. So maybe all the internet has really done is speed things up by a few decades. But Lewis throws the over-thirties among us a small bone by interviewing an aging rock group that uses the internet to raise money for a tour, an eighty-something woman who participates in WebTV polls, and the creators of TiVo. The second half of the book is a bit unconvincing. Set-top boxes, big deal. Those teenagers rule the book, and it would seem, the world. Lewis, as usual, writes an engaging book, it pulls you right in and moves quickly. The Lebed story itself makes the book worth your time. 
As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet. However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored. The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about. The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic. I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted 
I've read several bestsellers on the implications of the internet, but found this one a notch above the rest. Whilst others are often totally skewed by commercial and technological aspects, this one went a lot deeper and touched on the Meta changes underlying society. But far from being a grand, generalist thesis, Lewis grounds his observations in real flesh-and-blood stories that are highly readable. His experience as a professional writer shines through on every page. The only reason I didn't give this five stars was that I feel Lewis missed some fundamental factors in his analysis of the three teenagers whose stories constitute the bulk of the book. I agree with him that children are more likely to leverage new technology because they can adopt and create new personas quicker than adults who carry along years of baggage. But there is, perhaps, an explanation much closer to home. The reason kids can rebel against the "insiders" and push the limits with such dedication and passion is because they are not paying off mortgages and education for their own kids. Marcus Arnold, (the teenage prodigy legal expert) claimed, with total naivety, that he was handicapped against practising lawyers because he had 6 hours of school every day. Hogwash! The lawyers were handicapped because every hour of their day had to show some revenue return to cover their costs of living. And when the "outsiders" bemoan the former outsiders who capitulate and sellout their technological ventures to the highest bidding "insiders", it is invariably because they are no longer been funded by Dad, and need to start footing their own bills. Notwithstanding - this is an excellent book. 
Without beating about the bush, let me state that this is one of the best non-fiction books I have read on the effects of the Internet on our society. The book starts with the account of Jonathan Lebed, a 14 year old boy from New Jersey. Jonathan last year made half a million dollars in 6 months, using nothing but his savvy and the Internet. Using accounts and AOL and E-Trade, Jonathan and had bought stock, then using multiple fictitious names posted hundreds of messages on Yahoo Finance message boards recommending the stock to others. As a result, the stock would go up and Jonathan would make a nice profit on the sale. The book also looks into how another teenager, Marcus Arnold, registered himself as a law expert at Askme.com and soon reached the number one place in popularity. Lewis explores TV feedback technologies like the ones developed by Tivo (stock ticker: TIVO) and Sonicblue (stock ticker: SBLU), and how these technologies could affect us all in the near future. Lewis has a lot of information at his disposal and he disseminates it in a fascinating way. He has a lively style of writing and a great turn of phrase. For instance: "The old hotshot capitalist was so narrow-minded you could use his brain to slice salami." It cracked me up. A great read. Highly informative, highly interesting, highly recommended. http://ahmedakhan.journalspace.co 
The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say -- The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so. He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything. He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet. There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society. 
It's an engaging first-hand account from an anthropologist who went to live with an Inuit family. She gives a very candid account of her own difficulties in adapting to their culture 
Spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters. Just when you think Grisham can't do it again, he does it anyway 
I read legal thrillers to escape. I love them -- but with a bit of guilty pleasure as one consuming junk food for the mind. Not this one though. This book combines the thrill of escapist reading with a wholesome and affirming message that feeds the heart and mind 
Grisham delivers again with this great story about the dead billionaire's strange last will, and the redemption of the broken lawyer who sees the light. This has a spiritual message that is subtle, sincere, and uplifting, yet not beaten over your head. You'll walk away understanding how money can be a curse, and if you don't believe that, give this book a try 
I do not read a lot of book but this was a must read as soon as I started it. John Grisham describes places and people like very few can do. If you are anything like me the author must capture me in the first few pages or else I find something better to do. Loved the book and felt it was worth the time it takes me to read 
With every Grisham book I read, I get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human as well. For once, we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain. However, this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune. However, she does not know this. A lawyer is sent to find her, and in the process, undergoes a fundamental change of his own. This story takes place in Washington, Maryland, West Virginia, and the rain forests along the Brazilian-Bolivian border. In typical Grisham fashion, he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book, enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes. You can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions. You can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight. You can envision the rainforest, and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of Nate O'Riley. This is yet another Grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue. The pages literally turn themselves. Do not start this novel before going to bed, or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down. 
The filthy rich are interesting. Missionaries are interesting. The jungles of Brazil are interesting. Lawyers are interesting. OK, lawyers aren't interesting but Grisham sure makes them seem interesting and his book does a great job of tying together a wealthy, spoiled family to a single woman living in Brazil working as a missionary. The Testament is more than just a story; I believe the story shows the great difference between living for personal pleasure and living for something greater than one's self. In the end, which life really ends in the most satisfaction and pleasure? Does chasing money and pleasure really result in happiness? No. I believe Grisham excellently illustrates this principle through the story of the Phelan family and Rachel Lane. The book is very easy to read and the story is told cleverly. Grisham's accounts of Brazil, missionaries and lawyers are all based on his own personal hands-on experiential research which enhances the book. 
John Grisham has done it again. I had read this book originally a year after release. And I just finished my second read. And though it all started to come back to me as I read it...It was still an exciting page-turner as it was the first time. That says a lot about this book. A self-made billionaire, the tenth richest man in America, has all his heirs come in to prove he is sane and competent before signing his last Will and Testament. Which he does, right before he commits suicide in front of those still present. And of course as he leaves out each and every known heir from his will. And as you learn how greedy and selfish they are, you are pleased he did. He does pay off all his children's debt and leaves the remainder of his holdings to his illegitimate daughter no one knew he had. Nor does anyone know where she is. His law firm sends a drug/alcohol addict just out of rehab for the fourth time to find her. He finds her an M.D. who has dedicated her life to God and is working deep in the jungles of Brazil. I found the book a very fast read that has some plot twist and is well written. Well worth the read. 
Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle 
Troy Phelan is an old man who is dying fast. He is the 10th richest man on the Earth with a net worth of over $11 billion. For the past several months he has been writing and rewriting his will and testament to split his money as he sees fit. His three ex-wives and seven children all anxiously await his death and their chance to claim a piece of the $11 billion pie. The first of many surprises happens early on with Mr. Phelan's death and more importantly what is in the contents of the will. In his last will before his death there was not a single word about any of his ex-wives or children. The only name given any money to was an illegitimate child of Phelan named Rachel Lane, a missionary living deep in the swaps of the Pantanal in Brazil. This kicks of a vicious legal battle. Nate O'Riley becomes the one man who can change the outcome of the matter, given the job of finding the woman in the jungle, where every decision can mean life of death. The quest of Nate is an adventure full of suspense, action, discovery, and surprises. Meanwhile, the legal battle in the states becomes bigger and bigger, while the magnitude of the stakes and the personality of the characters begins to really come out. John Grisham took two intertwining settings and plots to create the best of his books that I have read. I thought that all the plot twists made for a very quick read. At many points in the book I felt that I wasn't going to be able to stop reading because of all the action, suspense, and the writing style 
This is the story of Paul Vincent Galvin, who at the time of his death in 1959 was Chairman of the Board of Motorola, Inc. and one of the most dynamic leaders on the American business scene. The Founders Touch is also the exciting account af a vast business buit from scratch, and the story of a man whose life reflected the changing world of the twentieth century. --- excerpt from book's back cove 
It's been a while since I've read one of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, but a sudden need for light reading found Ten Big Ones at the book store. Plum's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after Joe Morelli or Ranger, how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station, and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed. Definitely light fare, even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic. He not only wants Stephanie dead, but he also wants her end to be spectacular. Stephanie's response is to break up with her steady boyfriend, Joe Morelli, again, gorge on jelly donuts, and go into hiding at one of Ranger's lairs. Of course, this doesn't work as well as it should because even Ranger's soap is too sexy for words. And Stephanie, glutton for punishment that she is, she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile. So, you see, this is standard Stephanie Plum fare - lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss, usually with bad timing. My issue with Evanovich's books isn't with any particular one, but with what happens if you read too many at one time. Stephanie's biggest problem is herself - a decided lack of common sense. Which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter, but leaves her gun in the cookie jar. In four hundred pages this is funny, but if you've been reading a lot in a row, the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is dï¿½jï¿½ vu all over again. After a break of a year or so this goes away and I found Ten Big Ones a pleasure to read. It introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history. By all means, if you need a break from the weight of the world, take the time to read this. 
I picked up the first Stephanie Plum novel out of curiousity and wasn't disappointed. I've gone on to read every book in the series and have enjoyed every one. Rarely does a book have me laughing out loud, but I do with each one of these. The characters are wonderful. Grandma Mazur is great. She may be old, but she doesn't let that stop her. She'll try anything, anytime. I love Ranger and Joe. If I had two guys like that in my life, I'd have a hard time deciding between them too. I love the family dinners. The conversations are hilarious. You can picture Stephanie's dad trying so hard to tune everyone out and not quite succeeding. And Lula! She gets better with every book. Sure the situations and the characters can be a little out there at times, but isn't that what makes a great book? I love to get lost in a good book and tune out everything around me. I'm starting the 11th book next, I already have #12 and can't wait for the 13th to come out. I recommend this series to everyone. Give it a chance and read it for what it's supposed to be, escapism. There's too little of that these days and I think we all need it to some point in our lives 
When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum. Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered. In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger. She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt. But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid. She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself. In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm. Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment. In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy. And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious. All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark. The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable. Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again. Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone. I'm taking a vacation from this series. Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas. The series could be written by a twelve year old. Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes. You get the idea. Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though. She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list. It was only mentioned every other paragraph. Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does. Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment. If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series. 
Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum and her co-worker Lula are off to buy nachos, but in the meantime witness a robbery from the "Red Devil". No one was hurt, but yet another one of Stephanie's cars gets destroyed. Stephanie finds out the hard way that she is now being targeted by a gang. Now she's on a hit list for the famous "Junkman", and Stephanie has to stay in hiding to protect herself. Morelli and Stephanie are having a rocky relationship, and with fear that she might be endangering anyone she lives with, she sets off to find a good location. However, Stephanie manages to find her way to Ranger's apartment while he is away. Ranger has returned just in time to get a lead on Junkman, but has also hired several bodygaurds to keep Stephanie safe. All the while, Valerie is planning a wedding, but Junkman has confronted and threatened Stephanie. --- I want to tell you the end so badly, but you'll just have to read it for yourself! I must say I was somewhat disappointed with "Seven Up" and "Hard Eight", but this one exceeded my hopes. I didn't beat the last novel, but it still is a classic. Janet Evanovich has done yet another great job adding an unusual twist to the life of Stephanie Plum, and I never would have expected it to even begin the way it did! I know I can always count on these novels to be packed with plenty of thrills, and I still laughed. The best part was that we finally got more information on what Ranger is about. We didn't exactly see his "Bat Cave", but I was happy to hear Stephanie had finally managed to scope out his apartment, and so cleverly too 
If you've been following the Stephanie Plum series, you'll probably be pleased to know that the principal characters haven't changed a bit. What has changed is the level of danger involved and this time Stephanie has managed to get herself on the hit list of a killer linked to a violent gang. Both Morelli and Ranger want to keep her under lock and key, but neither handcuffs nor stun guns can keep a good hard headed girl down. Add in a cross-dressing foul-mouthed bus driver, the usual exploding car, and her sister's upcoming wedding, and you get a delightful mix of madness that only Janet Evanovich can deliver. Fast paced and wickedly funny. Amanda Richards, August 20, 200 
This is my routine for beginning a Stephanie Plum novel: I grab a few peanut butter Oreos and a glass of milk and curl up on the couch in my comfy pants. I open the book and read the first paragraph: "The way I see it, life is a jelly doughnut. You don't really know what it's about until you bite into it. And then, just when you decide it's good, you drop a big glob of jelly on your best T-shirt." And that's when I burrow just a little deeper into the couch cushions, confident that Janet Evanovich has written another laugh-out-loud winner I won't be able to put down. Moments of hilarity abound in TEN BIG ONES, Evanovich's tenth foray into the world of Stephanie Plum. In this outing, Stephanie (out of that sheer bad luck she can't seem to escape) witnesses one of a chain of robberies by the "Red Devil," a gang member who's been terrorizing Trenton's convenience stores and delis for months. Not only does she see the robbery (and, inevitably, get her car blown up), but she also sees the Red Devil's face--which, unfortunately, makes her a target for two of Trenton's most prominent, scariest gangs. Since she doesn't want to put on-again love Joe Morelli or her family in danger, Steph retreats into hiding in the only place she knows no one will ever find her, a place she only stumbled upon by sheer luck (good this time): Ranger's apartment (be still my heart). More bad news is awaiting her outside the walls of Ranger's plush digs, however: The Red Devil's gang has hired a contract killer called "The Junkman" to ferret her out--and to show no mercy when he finds her. But Stephanie still has a job to do, and reading about her attempts to bring in her FTAs while at the same time being on the lookout for her assassin is pure entertainment. All our favorite characters are back--including Sally Sweet, rock-star drag-queen extraordinaire. He hasn't been around since FOUR TO SCORE, and he makes a triumphant return in TEN BIG ONES by adding school bus driver (think Otto, from The Simpsons) and wedding planner for Steph's sister Valerie to his rï¿½sumï¿½. There's Lula, of course, whose closet has no end of hot-pink and animal-print spandex clothing (if you could call it clothing); and Granda Mazur, who's 70 but looks 100; and Joe Morelli, who loves Steph almost as much as he is exasperated by her; and, of course, there's Ranger--enigmatic, good-smelling, sexy man of mystery who Stephanie (and me, too) finds completely irresistible. Steph's FTAs are great characters, too, as usual; among them is a woman who robbed a Frito Lay truck and has since developed an addiction to Doritos. Whether you like this installment or not will come down to your individual preference. People who prefer the more action-packed Plum plots (say THAT five times fast!) may not be in love with this one; the plot of TEN BIG ONES tends to meander--Stephanie takes lots of showers, eats lots of doughnuts, and feeds Rex quite a few morsels in this one. But those who read the Stephanie Plum books for the characters, who feel like Evanovich's Trenton gang is a second family--you will LOVE this one. All our favorites are there, in all their glory, being just as goofy as we remember. I'm a member of the second group of readers; I really enjoyed TEN BIG ONES. Aside from a rather abrupt ending, Janet Evanovich has offered up another winner. On to Number 11...I can already hear the Oreos calling my name 
Some writers are trashing this 10th offering and accusing the author of having someone else write for her. So What! I laughed and smiled a lot as this book kept me company on my long daily commute. Have fun, buy it.. enjoy 
After reading this series in order, and just finishing TEN BIG ONES, I still haven't figured out what the titles have to do with the books. Other than that confusion, I continue to be delighted with the characters and the plots. Stephanie Plum continues to be featured in this series. In the first installation, she had to become a bounty hunter in order to pay her bills. Stephanie has absolutely no skill as a bounty hunter and relies more on blind luck than anything else which is exactly what we see in TEN BIG ONES. As Stephanie is trying to decide on nachos or a sandwich for lunch, she witnesses a robbery. When the theft goes bad, partly due to her sidekick Lula destroying the get-away vehicle, the notorious Red Devil removes his mask for a split second giving Stephanie a chance to see his face. Seeing a criminal in action is bad enough, but when he belongs to a local gang, The Slayers, things go from bad to worse. We're given the usual group of support characters in TEN BIG ONES. I have to say that the plot is secondary to catching up with the happenings in each of the support casts' lives. I adore Grandma Mazur and just the mention of her name brings a smile to my face. She's feisty and refuses to be the sedate grandmotherly type - she relishes in Stephanie's escapades and joins her any chance she's given. Lula is becoming more of a partner to Stephanie as the series progresses and she's still the same street smart, smart mouthed ex-ho that we've all come to know and love. But TEN BIG ONES gives us a bit more detail about the ever elusive Ranger, bounty hunter extraordinaire. Stephanie is on a hit list from the Slayers and has to hide to stay alive. She discovers Ranger's apartment and moves in while he's out of town. I never would have guessed that the apartment is luxurious and full of amenities not thought to be associated with Ranger - like ironed sheets and towels so thick you get lost in them. Other sub cast members are delved into a bit more in this book ... like the return of Sally Sweet, the foul-mouthed drag queen rocker (Does Evanovich ever have "normal" characters? No, thank God! These are much more fun!). Seems Sally has become a school bus driver during the day and drag queen rocker only at night. He's loveable even though he's confusing. Lula is still around and enjoyable, but we don't see much of Vinnie, the owner of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds. I'm waiting for the book in which we get more info on him, now that should be interesting! The plot is a bit confusing. Stephanie sees the Red Devil, he's part of a gang, so she's placed on a hit list. Huh? Why is she on a hit list - he's not one of the head guys, he's just a member of the gang. She retreats to Ranger's apartment and when he returns, we're not given the romance we'd expect, instead they dance around each other yet again. And Joe Morelli (Stephanie's on-again off again boyfriend) doesn't even have a coronary when he finds out she's hidden out with Ranger. Things that make ya go hmmm... but not for long, because the plot doesn't have to be solid for this series to be enjoyable. The characters alone make the price of admission worth it! If you're looking for a solid mystery plot with fast action and a mind boggling journey, this is definitely not the book or series for you. If you want to enjoy a few hours and feel like you're at home with friends, and if you want to be entertained, then pick up this series and enjoy. You'll soon feel like part of the group and not be able to wait for more stories from them. 
A very thorough analysis of the contemporary trends in Western Europe from an American writer who lives there. Bawer starts with an indepth description of the European social structure and the state of mind of the Europeans since WW2, that exposed them to the risk of being taken over by an intolerant but dedicated idealogy. He concludes that Western Europe, as we know and cherish, is moving towards its own destruction through a takeover by the wave of Muslim immigration. He points the main reasons in: the tolerance for the intolerant, by the multiculturalism that is dominating the dogmatic thinking of the European elites and by the pasivity of the Europeans who lost their respect for their own values and culture. Bawer backs his thesis by both statistical facts, quotes from local articles, lectures and report, as well as testimonies from private conversations he had with native Europeans. A must read book, well written, that would bring tears to your eyes, if you have a sentiment to the Old World and an appreciation to its vanishing moral values 
This is an excellent and insightful book that should be required reading in high schools. I have never been to Europe and must say that after reading While Europe Slept I have zero desire to go. For years I have ranted about the scourge of "political correctness" to my friends and family and refuse to partake in it. This book is a great illustration of how destruction PC is. I wonder if Europe will wake up before it's too late? 
In his book Bruce Bawer outlines the negative impact of immigration policies in Western Europe. Essentially Bawer points out that instead of encouraging integration, Western Europe focuses on multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is the idea that new cultures maintain a separate identity, even though immigrants have taken up residence in a new nation (ideally multiculturalism is acceptance of all cultures; but that is rarely seen in reality). Multiculturalism in Western Europe has created a culture of fear. A culture so fearful of offending Muslims, that Westerners are sacrificing their freedoms and liberties to appease a growing Muslim minority. The combination of Islam's intolerance for the West and the West's fear of being perceived as racist has led to a society where Dutch women wear hijabs (traditional Muslim head covers) in public for fear of being raped. The murder rate in Sweden has increased to nearly double that of the United States.  The only hope for Europe, Bawer claims, is for Europeans to take a tough stance on extremism. Europe must punish, deport and deny entry to people who preach hate. Europe must be willing to force immigrant children to go to secular schools and force immigrants themselves to learn the national language. Europeans must be willing to defend their freedoms; otherwise we'll see a Europe ruled by sharia law (strict literal implementation of the Koran's law). 
This poor hodgepodge of a book should have been structured to explicate the immigration policies of each European country, then describe the experiences of each country with its Islamic radicals (and their families). Instead, there is just a spouting forth of this and that information in a way that does not help readers see which immigration measures are useful and which are negative. The poor linkage of measures to experience deprives readers of any handle on how the European countries can improve the situation in the future. The author seems to feel that the United States has a much better handle on immigration than the European countries; he fails to note that the U.S. also has inconsistencies and problems in how it handles immigration. This book is an example of a first draft that should have received far better treatment during the editorial process. It should have been improved beyond simply an emotional screed into a book that enables readers to see what policies seem most effective in integrating immigrants into the body politic and which leave immigrants as separate, poor, and disillusioned groupings vulnerable to exploitation by organizations trying to undermine the European countries 
This book REALLY serves to answer some questions I had about the current state of the world in general. Europe vs. Islam, US vs. Eurpoe, Islam vs. The World... Amazing. Some good details, but the first-hand accounts of the problems in Europe are more propelling, IMHO. Couldn't put it down 
I finished this book very quickly and found it to be both very illuminating on the Muslim-immigrant experience and the foibles of the native-born Europeans who, raised on socialism and convinced of their sophistication, have lost the ability to comprehend much less deal with a violent ideology that wants to destroy their 'utopia'. The author alternates between describing personal incidents (the assault on his partner in downtown Olso in the middle of the day, defending his country's history to brainwashed socialists) and local/regional events and discourse(growing crime rates, segregation at schools, growing anti-semitism, threats on free speech and expression, murder/assasination of specific artists and politicos). My highlights: *norwegian imams (religious leaders) claim state welfare should be considered jizah(sp?): protection money non-muslims must pay to muslims in muslim-occupied lands. *Forced-marriages: women are betrothed against their will at an early age. Their husbands typically come from the family homeland and after marriage they are legally entitled to join their spouse in Europe. This keeps muslim women 'under the yoke' of traditionalism (via physical abuse). *Political capitulation: actual politicians defend violent imams and their rhetoric and chastise the native born for any implied criticism towards the religion of Islam, or any individual muslim. * Political CAPITULATION: Norwegian lawmakers suggest that Norwegian women alter their dress to become more sensitive to muslim attitudes (the attitude that a woman is responsible for her own rape). Also, attempts to undermine freedom of speech go largely unchallenged. * Native born muslims (2nd gen immigrants) are incubated from the democratic values by their parents and raised to believe that infidels are pigs, their women are whores, and that they must eventually take over the country. CONS: * A bit short. Also, one standing question: why did W.Europeans import cheap laborers from Turkey,Iran, Iraq, Morocco, and not E. Europeans? * While several offical studies regarding crime, changing demographics, and opinion polls are referred to, i was hoping for more substantial coverage of the raw data. A bibliography would have been nice too, so we can check the data for ourselves. *This isn't really a con but a misfortune, this book was probably hitting the bookstores around the same time as the controversy erutpted surrounding the Prophet Muhammad cartoons. The author's insights on this incidence would have made a brilliant finale. What i found most compelling was the author's assessment of the European mentality: the internationalist and appeasment way of thought germinated in an, until recently, sheltered cocoon of intellectual hubris. 
While Europe Slept is one of those books that is a must read for every American today. The author is so knowledgable about the Europeans and their view of America that he dispels the notion that "Americans are the bad guys" Sure we have our faults but not in comparison to western Europe thinking. Bawer points out that the elite run Europe without any concern for the common man. It was interesting to note that the elite do not want the Muslims to integrate and they allow great amounts of funds to provide welfare to the Muslims. Therefore, they are jobless but receive welfare that allows them to attend mosques which preach against democracy, jews and the country in which they reside. Muslim law and practices are paramount to them, however, breaking the law (they often do)or laws of their country of residence and citizenship appears to be common. Muslim enclaves want to be left alone and ignore all other laws, courts and police. The current path of European thinking and governing will, according to the author lead to muslim domination of that country. This is such an excellent book and that all Americans should read it to put Europe in the proper prospective and to realize the continuing threat of extreme terrorism perpetrated by extremist muslims will not just go away. 
I can understand why the secular left does not the Christians here in the USA, but what I don't understand is how they seem completely oblivious to what their fate would be if Osama and those like him win this war we are in. The radical left needs to read this book. Someone get a copy to Rosie ODonnell and Michael Moore 
Bruce Bawer's book is informative and covers quite a lot of ground in its description of the insidious nature of radical Islam in Europe and how the political elite are more enamoured with political power over a propagandised electorate instead of applying themselves to the defence of freedom. But that is what European style government is all about despite the contemporary terrorism of radical Islam, and is--like democracy--the antithesis of freedom. Whilst radical Islam is a major threat in itself because of its inclination to subvert and murder to achieve its goals, the biggest problem that Europeans must address is the entire nature of the socialist-gangster political systems that all European nations are governed by in association with the additional layer of super-beaureaucy that is the EU. Before Europeans can banish the evils of radical Islam, they must swiftly move to a higher ethics devoid of philosophies-of-faith so that they have moral certitude about what must be done with the radical Islamists, even if that demands that the radical Islamists are expelled from western Europe by whatever force is necessary. I was somewhat perplexed by Bruce Bawer's relentless eulogising of America's virtues--even though they are many and laudable in comparison to those of Europe--since it it is well understood that the American administration is in the throes of implementing a draconian diminution of freedom under the pretext of the-war-on-terror allied to demands form far-right Christian fundamentalist groups who have vastly too much influence over Politicians and the judiciary. It can often come across like a propaganda piece for Washington :-) Readers of this book should also read Celsius 7/7 by Michael Gove for a more focused analysis of the problem of radical Islam 
Best of its ilk, The Rainmaker surpasses most legal thrillers without a doubt. A quick read; start to finish a great novel. This book as defiantly started me on Grisham saga, that won't end until I've read all his books. I highly recommend this to any one who has any remote interest in the law, or just reading in general. A 
I was a little reluctant to read this one, mainly because I was so bored by Grisham's "The Client" and because I heard this was a "funny" book. Usually funny means excessively silly and cute. However, just a few pages into this novel I knew it was different. Maybe becuase I could relate to the Rudy character, having graduated grad school not too long ago and having concerns about what Id be able to do with my degree, it kept me reading non-stop. THe writing is personable, like it's really written by a young man just out of law school. The humor in it is just right, not over the top silly, but enough to make me laugh every so often. It's also fascinating material for anyone who has considered going into law ot just like watching law-based shows on TV. A few reviewers have pointed out that there are a couple inconsistencies with the story, particularly the ending, though by that time I was more than willing to cut Grisham a little slack and overlook it. THe previous 500 pages of enjoyment I got gave him some leeway in putting together an ending that was, maybe, a little clumsy. Whenever I read one of Grisham's novels I think that the main characters, in some way, reflect on his own experiences and opinions from when he was an attorney. All I can say is that I am very glad that the legal profession turned out not to be his true love and that he decided to become an author. I highly recommend this book 
This book is a good read... fun story and the characters are very likeable 
The Rainmaker is an intriguing story that will keep readers wanting to turn the page. Written by John Grisham, this story has inspired readers everywhere. It's a story of compassion, devotion, and love- This is the story of a lawyers struggle through the beginning of his career. The Rainmaker is about a rooky lawyer named Rudy Baylor who just graduated from law school. He has passed his bar exam and has taken on his first cases as a lawyer. Since Rudy has no money and no place to live, he's just looking for some easy money makers. At least that's what he thinks these cases are, but Rudy gets in over his head. These so called easy cases turn into a fight for justice in this small town. With the help of his new found partner, a friend who knows the ropes of law, and some ways around it, Rudy finds the real lawyer inside of him, vs. the lawyer that breezed through college. He fights for what's right against a dishonest insurance company that won't cover a young man with leukemia and a young woman with an abusive husband. This story follows his struggles, hardships and breakthroughs. This is an extraordinary story. It's a story for all readers and one that everyone will enjoy. This novel is written so well you feel like you're not just reading it, but your there, in the courtroom, or in the office, or wherever the story may take you. The details, it's not superficial or unrealistic, and how the characters are written make the story even more real. It almost feels like a biography, like Rudy's thoughts were written down on paper as he thought them. Reading this story will inspire young lawyers, and young readers everywhere. I can truly say that this novel is one that I can read over and over and still be taken aback by this story of affection, love, and allegiance.

It was true to the movie, which was wonderful. I highly reccommend the book and Amazon offered it at a much lower price than Barnes and Noble 
I love this storyline. Baylor is a lovable character and has a true sense of what justice should be, and he makes certain that his clients do not go unheard 
This novel is an underdog story of a young lawyer, Rudy Baylor, barely out of law school who goes against the big guns--that of a very corrupt insurance company defended by lawyers from a big, prestigious law firm. You cannot help but root for Rudy, who put himself through college and law school and who is so desperate for a job in law that his job-hunting leads to a very low point: He finds work from a corrupt lawyer. However, through circumstances beyond his control, Rudy soon finds himself with his own struggling practice with a paralawyer (Grisham invention) named Deck. Deck is an unattractive, unethical guy who does what it takes to get the job done. He is an amusing character and rings true-to-life. I think that most people know someone like him, or know of someone like him. Nonetheless, in the end, I feel sorry for how things turned out for him. Rudy's biggest case is the Blacks vs. Great Benefit, an oh-so-evil insurance company. The Blacks are a senior couple with a dying son who needs a bone marrow operation that GB will not pay for. GB preys on the poorly-educated with medical policies that don't cover much at all in reality. (*Spoiler alert*: Don't read the following stuff within the parentheses, else it may ruin one of the best moments in the book. GB's employee manuals for claims handlers and underwriters instruct the GB employee to deny every claim initially! They only pay for claims that don't cost much and/or when threatened with litigation.) I really hope that insurance companies like GB don't exist; it is merely a Pollyanna hope, I suppose. However, if we didn't have evil companies (or evil organizations, agencies, etc.), we wouldn't have great courtroom dramas (or just plain drama). Things are more interesting when you have conflicts involving good versus evil, or some forms of those opposing realities. After reading this book, I know why Grisham is a bestselling author. He delivers the goods in an exceptional way. I find myself just flowing along with his words-it's so readable. There are parts in this particular story that aren't that believable (most of the breaks that Rudy gets in the case against GB), but somehow it doesn't diminish the excitement of the story 
Rudy Baylor is a law student in his last year of law school. As one of his projects, he is required to offer free legal advice to senior citizens at the local nursing home. Little did he realize that he would meet Dot and Buddy Black who would present to him the lawsuit of all times, one that would make him a "Rainmaker". Rudy jumped right in and fought for the Black's son Donny Ray who was diagnosed with Leukemia and then later denied medical treatment by a large insurance company for no apparent reason. Rudy is thorough and compassionate in his work and never gives up the case. He fights for his client even though he has little courtroom experience. An exciting novel 
This book really is an insult. It's "lesson" and "assignments" are HORRIBLE. They ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book. In a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on. Check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read 
I had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course...unfortunately, the instructor never even flipped through it. It is by far the WORST photography book, really the worst book I have ever purchased! There are typo's, the "example photos" and instruction sometime are not the same. The projects are lame and really teach nothing. I would not recommend this book under any circumstances...AVOID AT ALL COST!!! [... 
Edmund Burke (1729-1797)wrote REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE in 1789 which was four years before the rise of the fanatical Jacobins and the execution (murder)of Louis XVI. This book was not only well written but very prophetic on the tragic events that were part of the French Revolution. Burke showed historical insight and warned both the British and the French what was going to happen. Burke cited conditions in France prior to the French Revolution. He certainly did not give a false representation of the economic and social conditions in France, but he was clear that, while not perfect, the French had advanced culture and tolerable living standards. He also warned the French that abrupt changes without recourse to tradition and legal norms were dangerous and would end in tyranny. Readers should be aware that Burke's assessment of the French political system was that the French had reasonble politcal freedom and prosperity. To destroy this political system would end in political disruption, social and political violence, lack of law-and-order, and the rise of tyrannical military leaders. One should note Burke's assessment of the members of the French National Assembly which was vacilating and subject to the whims of any "political interest group" was serious. He suggested that military officers would be among those "pleaders" would be military officers who would be difficult to control. He also warned that when someone who understood the art of command got control of the military officers, the days of the French Republic and the National Assembly were over. The military commander would be in total control, and this is exactly what happened when Napolean I (1769-1821)started to exhibit military genius, he quickly got power by a coup d' etat in 1799 and became the French Emperor by 1804. Burke's warnings of disaster and tragedy were fullfilled. From at least 1792 until 1815, the French were almost constantly at war with most Europeans. While the French Empire expanded beyond anything prior French monarchs ever dreamed of, the collapse of the French Empire came quickly, and the French empire was ended by 1815 at terrible cost in both blood treasure. Burke warned of these dangers, and his predictions were accurate. Burke lived just long enough to see the rise and fall of the maniacal Jacobins which included the Reigh of Terror (1792-1794)and the execution of King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie antionette. Had Burke lived a few more years, he could have resorted to remarking, "I told you so." Edmund Burke has been defined as a conservative which is true. However, Burke was not a reactionary. Burke realized that progress, whatever that may mean, is often slow and within the confines of historical tradition, legal norms, and established law. Burke warned his readers, to use modern parlance, against "wipe the slate clean." Burke clearly understood that to "wipe the slate clean, meant mass dislocation of men and ultimately mass executions (mass murder). Subsequent modern political revolutions vindicate this view. Readers may wonder why Burke expressed support for the American Revolution but strongly opposed the French Revolution. A careful examination of these revolutions provides the answer. The American "revolutionaries" were arguing for their "Rights of Englishmen" which had a long tradition in Great Britain. Henry II (1154-1189) started the use grand juries. The English had the right of trial by jury by the time of Edward I (1272-1307). The fact is the American colonists wanted to rules of common law and long established legal traditions to apply to them. The British wanted to rule the American colonists with administrative law using clever bureaucrats, as Burke would probably have called them, rather than use British Constitutional Law and the Common Law which many American colonists demanded. The French, on the other hand, wanted to replace a weak monarch with "clever bureaucrats" which Burke knew very well could not work in France. Readers should note that Thomas Paine (1737-1809)wrote a response to Burke's REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION titled THE RIGHTS OF MAN. While Paine's views were different than those of Burke's Paine's book was just as brilliant as Burke's. Readers should read both works if they want exposure to profound political thought and excellent writing. This is much preferred to the current political nonsense that is pushed by media talking heads and journalists who cannot think or write. Burke and Paine were well read men and offered readers history lessons as well as politcal lessons. Edmund Burke's REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE is highly recommended regardless of one's political persuasion. This book is not a light read and takes time. However, one will be better informed and wiser for doing so. Again, this reviewer suggests the reader should read Thomas Paine's THE RIGHTS OF MAN to draw comparisons and contrasts 
In 1789, the year of the French Revolution, Burke received a request from a good friend living in France to provide his thoughts on the Revoution. The result- one of the finest pieces of political discourse ever written. For those encountering Burke for the first time, his adament defense of the crown, and of hereditary succcesion, seem to make a hypocrite of this self-proclaimed liberal. Burke, however, was not defending an absolute monarch who ruled under the charter of divine right, but rather, pointing out the danger of a perfect democracy, whose sovereign (the national assembly) was compelled not to a moral authority such as a Church, nor to a fixed consitution. In short, liberty was safer restricted in civil socity, than left unchecked. Whether you find Burke's analysis, consistent with your political leanings, or more likely, you find his writing very offensive, you can appreciate both the efffect of this work on American and European political though, as well as the reason and intelligence with which it was written. 
This small title is actually a letter that the author wrote to a friend in France. When Edmund Burke wrote this letter about the French Revolution (where the king was overthrown and beheaded by the masses aka Jacobins), English scholars agree that the result was the finest piece of prose in the English language; only a few poets have succeeded in writing something finer. Whether you agree with Burke's interpretation or not is not the point; he penned the finest piece of literature ever in the English language. As a historian and social commentator, Burke is a "structural functionalist" decades before that term was dreamed up. He recognizes that the French are not only creatures of their culture, but prisoners. And to compare them to the English colonists and other insurgents in the American colonies who revolted against the British government is to compare apples and oranges. Whereas the Yankee revolution of 1776 was Biblically-inspired and the propaganda for rebellion preached from the pulpits, the French were railing AGAINST the Catholic Church for keeping people ignorant and in their Dark Age. Burke says the French Revolution is a revolution without its moorings, without the necessary principles to guide individual behavior, and without the maintenance of institutions that long provided stability and security. What the French philosophes were writing was mere balderdash, says Burke. Without their traditions, customs, and institutitions that had slowly brought the French out of barbarity and into a civilized manner of living, Burke saw in revolution a rapid decline and fall of the French people into a visciousness of dog-eat-dog. In short, Burke saw the French Revolution as lacking virtue and descending into terrorism; whereas the Yankee Revolution was virtuous and grew into a democracy. Whether you agree with Burke or not, and I do not, his writing in this letter to a friend is the finest example of English writing to be found and should be read by everyone simply for that reason alone 
This is an indispensible essay for anyone who has ever been interested in politics. It is composed of beautiful prose, crisp logic, and perennially relevant material. You must read Burke to understand the why it is worth being critical of the French Revolution and to understand some major reasons for the counter-revolutionary movement in France.  
Very good in the sequel line, but I figured out "who dun it" before I finished. The characters are still developing well, waiting for the next one. I have the whole series. 
Boulder, Colorado author, Margaret Coel calls the wolf a wonderful animal. "It's always two looks ahead," of everybody else, she says. Using the wolf as metaphor, she gets the villain in her mystery novel THE EYE OF THE WOLF at least two looks ahead of both readers and main characters. The 11th in her series featuring the Boston Irish priest Father John O'Malley and Arapaho lawyer, Vicky Holden as the crime solvers, THE EYE OF THE WOLF takes the reader to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. There, traditional enemies, the Arapaho and Shoshone, share the land. Father John serves an Arapaho parish. Vicky works with an Arapaho law firm. The two are close friends. As EYE OF THE WOLF opens, someone has killed three Shoshone college students on the Bates Battlefield, where in 1874, Shoshone scouts led the United States Cavalry to an Arapaho village. The soldiers slaughtered everyone living there. Animosity between the Shoshone and Arapaho, two very different peoples with diverse cultures, has smoldered since. Father John fears the worst when he sees the latest bodies at Bates, all posed like dead warriors in old photographs. Someone wants to encourage the hatred. Why? And Who? He, his parishioners, and the police suspect Frankie Montana. This Arapaho trouble has often fought with Shoshones in bars,. Because he drifts around the reservation drinking and crashing at drug houses, most decent people of both groups despise Frankie. His mother, Lucille, begs Vicky to become Frankie's lawyer. Lucille believes he's innocent. Because Lucille is a friend, Vicky agrees to take the case. However, she, too, believes Frankie is guilty. He concern is to get him a fair trial. Frankie asserts he did not commit the crime, but will not talk to Vicky or the police. As he eludes them out of sheer terror of jail, Father John finds a fourth Shoshone victim at Bates. Looking at the evidence against Frankie, Vicky begins think he may not be the killer. So does Father John, after talking to people in the parish. But, then who is? Can Father John and Vicky find the person, and prove his or her identify to the police? Or--is the murderer like the wolf--two looks ahead ? Will that give him or her time to kill again? Worse, have Father John and Vicky made a mistake to believe Frankie? Is he really the killer? Will he prove it by shooting one of them? Their gamble on Frankie brings EYE OF THE WOLF to an end that one one could possibly expect. But the conclusion makes perfect sense, because Margaret Coel writes with understanding of Arapaho and Shoshone history. Through that history, she reveals the killer. Also through that history, she also makes EYE OF THE WOLF more than just another mystery with an explosive ending. As the story unfolds, she presents two Native American groups that get little attention from novelists. Working closely with people who live on Wind River Reservation, she makes sure her depiction is accurate. So EYE OF THE WOLF is not something like, or just like a wolf, it IS a wolf--two looks ahead of everybody. Readers will not only enjoy a gripping mystery, but they'll also learn something about other people and their lives. They'll receive the lesson through rich, well-developed and belleville characters, quirky little subplots, lively dialogue, and solid description of locale 
Margaret Coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and describes the Arapahoe customs in wonderful detail. In this installment, Father O'Malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians has been re-ignited, and that dead Indians can be found on an ancient battle ground. When Father O'Malley goes to investigate, he discovers three dead Shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles. Things heat up when the young Shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends. Vicky Holden, the other main character in the series, has entered into a law partnership with Adam Lone Eagle, and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling. Vicky wants to defend Frankie Montana, who is a suspect in the murders, and Adam tries to persuade her not to take Frankie as a client. As always, author Coel creates a wonderful setting and characters, and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series. 
It is hard to believe that Margaret Coel began her Wind River Reservation series some ten years ago with THE EAGLE CATCHER, which introduced readers to Father John O'Malley and defense attorney Vicky Holden. Each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between O'Malley and Holden. The latest installment in this series is no exception. EYE OF THE WOLF begins with a cryptic telephone message that is left for O'Malley on an answering machine. This leads him to the site of a historic battlefield, one that resulted in the slaughter of an Arapaho Indian village by U.S. forces, aided by Shoshone scouts. In modern times Arapahos and Shoshones are somewhat uneasy neighbors on the Wind River Reservation, with their antagonistic history providing a shadowy backdrop, gone but not entirely forgotten. But past differences are brought to the forefront when O'Malley discovers the bodies of three Shoshones on the old battlefield, positioned to mimic those of the dead killed in the historic battle. Frankie Montana, a chronic client of Holden's, is the primary suspect. Despite Montana's recidivistic tendencies, Holden does not believe he is capable of murder. It eventually becomes clear to Holden and O'Malley that someone is attempting to revive the long-dormant conflict between the Arapahos and Shoshones --- and that Holden has placed herself in terrible danger on behalf of her client. While Coel has created an extensive backstory contributing to the Wind River Reservation mythos, it is not necessary to read what has transpired before EYE OF THE WOLF. The tension between O'Malley and Holden builds from page to page, as they struggle to protect the innocent --- and each other --- from an unknown malefactor. At the same time, both are protective of O'Malley's priestly vows, even as their emotions practically --- but subtly --- beg for violation. EYE OF THE WOLF is an excellent introduction to the Wind River Reservation series, while providing a welcome return to the area and its people for longtime followers of the series. Given the longevity of these novels, it is clear that Coel can continue to explore this beautiful, dangerous landscape for as long as she wishes. Recommended. --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlau 
The poetic macabre message shakes up Father John O'Malley, the Jesuit Pastor at St. Francis on the Wind River Plantation. The caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths. Not long afterward, at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the Shoshone betrayed the Arapaho to the cavalry, three Shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here. Frankie Montana, who was seen recently arguing with the Shoshone and has quite a rap sheet is charged with the triple homicides. His lawyer Vicky Holden believes Frankie who insists he is innocent because she knows this low life would do just about anything but not murder. As she mounts a defense, she wonders if the culprit is cunningly trying to cause an Indian war between the two tribes for some unknown reason or a psychopath is avenging the century plus slaughter. The latest Wind River Reservation Mystery, EYE OF THE WOLF, is a fabulous legal thriller that uses brutal late nineteenth century carnage as the apparent motive to twenty-first century murders. The story line moves out rather quickly when Father O'Malley listens to the high pitched poetry of the killer on his voice machine and never takes a breather as Vicky tries to prove her client did not commit the crime though circumstantially he appears heading for the fall. Margaret Coel is at her best with this tale that affirms why so many readers feel she is the heir apparent to the Hillerman mantle. Harriet Klausner 
Eye of the Wolf by Margaret Coel ISBN: 0425205460 - Due out today (6 September 2005) - I was sent an ARC of this great book to read for review which I do gladly. I had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them, especially Spirit Woman and Story Teller, so was expecting good things. I was not disappointed - the series follows the adventures of Father John O'Malley, pastor of St. Francis Mission on the Wind River Reservation and tribal attorney, Vicki Holden and apart from a ripping good mystery, the author weaves the history of the Arapho and the Soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well, bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life. It is not hard to care about the "Indian priest" as they call Father John or Vicky Holden. I think what I enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well - they were brought vividly alive by the author's words. From the first mystery message "This is for the Indian priest", everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the 19th century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield - but does it?? This is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish. 
At a lunch with a studio executive,screenwriter John Dunne was insisting on a story point in the script that he had written with his wife,Joan Didion, the excutive mimed reaching under the table and bringing out,"The Monster",their money, to win the argument. Seven or eight years they toiled on the script that became ,"Up Close and Personal",this is the chronicle of their experiences. Fascinating and sobering, when you realize how things can dissolve and then reappear in a completly different form. It is very well told and forshadows his health problems that cost him his life in 2003, that his wife wrote so exquisitly about in "The Year of Magical Thinking". If how movies get made is of any interest to you this and his other film making tale, "The Studio" will fascinate you. 
It took eight years to make Up Close and Personal, a movie about a television reporter and her mentor, starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. This book, by one of the screenplay writers, is a must for anyone who wants an example of just how absurd movie making can be. From the original story of Jessica Savitch, an ambitious and ultimately self-destructive young woman, Dunne's screenplay transforms over many years and many rewrites into a story that would get Disney's stamp of approval, which translates into "a feel good movie with an uplifting storyline". Often hilarious and at times moving, Monster gives you a real feeling for the time, skill, and patience it takes to create a screenplay. Just remember this is not an instructional guide to screenplay writing, see it rather as a cautionary tale. After reading this, you may wonder how movies get made at all 
Even though L.M. Montgomery did not intend Anne of Green Gables to be a series, she still captivates with her eager readers in Anne of Avonlea. There are still quite a few differences, Anne has grown from a "queer", fiery, young girl to a wiser, calmer, auburn-headed schoolteacher. Yes, a schoolteacher. Also, as we follow Anne in this Bildungsroman literature, the romance between her and Gilbert Blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel. Some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first, and perhaps this is because Anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude. Altogether, my opinion of the book is that it was a good follow-up and I sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as Anne of Green Gables. 
How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction. I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books. At least the movies keep your interest 
Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all. The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series. My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them. Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time. This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues. I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly. 
Red haired with a flaming temper, the phenomenal Anne Shirley is back in her 2nd book! Marilla, a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing Anne up (when she was an orphan) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins, Davy and Dora Keith. Anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble. Davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes: like making his sister Dora walk the pig fence! Davy??s idea of fun includes violence and humor ?V but only for himself. The girls have to teach Davy manners, which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy. Anne??s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again, but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world. At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her ??Sweet Teacher??. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair ??carrots??) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn??t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger. My mom keeps telling me to go and do work but I cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written. I like the others in this series also.Thank you L.M. Montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life!~~ Referring to the special collectors editio 
I love this story. Echo lodge was great. It was about the last book where Anne is in Avonlea and a little girl. Very excellent book 
This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables. It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college. Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad. It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first). Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change). For anyone who liked the first book, this is sure to not disappoint 
It never ends, luckily!!! I will never tire of Anne's wonderful, lively imagination. In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles! Anyways, more happens in this story than a change in appearance: Anne becomes the Avonlea schoolma'am, and loves her students like crazy, especially little Paul Irving, who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher. Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT 
Anne of Avonlea was almost as good as the first Anne book. It is about Anne's life as a school teacher in Avonlea. Marilla adopts two mischievous twins and Mrs. Rachel Lynde moves in. So life is never dull for Anne at the school house or at Green Gables. You could read it on its own, but I recommend you read Anne of Green Gables first 
I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. Now I'm 21 and recendly read it again, and I liked it even more. The plot is great. The characters are alive, and the writing is superb.A must for anyone that wants to laugh, love and cry with the town from Avonlea 
The book encourages students to explore their own strengths and weaknesses, and prompts them to recognize aspects of themselves in ways they probably hadn't thought before. Most of us are quite curious about what our strengths might be, and with this book, the student's self-examination isn't a painful process. Rather than offering a step by step list of Do's and Don'ts, the approach taken here is to help the student develop a highly individualized action plan to help them take control managing their coursework. It's a relatively hefty book, at least compared to others I've seen in this genre, but this doesn't detract. 
This book is really helpful for those who have had difficulty with studying and time management. It also helps highlight some of those "everything I need to know, I really did learn in Kindergarten" moments. Often I don't keep textbooks, because I know I'll never use most of them again. This book is exactly the opposite, in that I know I will use it again, be it with relationship conflicts, time management, a reminder to detach from my identities, or anything else. There is such a wealth of helpful information, that I fail to understand the ranting low reviews. Apparently some people have nothing better to do with their time than bitch. Pity, really 
I found this book to be full of endless tips on how to study and make the best use of my time and energy. 
The item was how it was described, and shipping was speedy. It came in way before my classes even started. Awesom 
It's one of the BEST book I've ever read or seen.. Pages are all colorful and nice design very attracting the eye so we read more, and interesting story inside and motivational. I totally recommend this book if you are trying to pursue a better learning skills wether you are in school or you just want to learn to LEARNING about everything.. it's useful book for you 
This book was required reading for my "Introduction to the Freshman Experience" class and it is a must read for everyone. Ideas and concepts found in "Becoming a Master Student" can be applied to every aspect of life. The techniques found in this book were very helpful to me as a student,an employee and as a person. I highly recommend this book 
Whether it's the war between Bucky Katt and Fungo the ferret, Rob's ongoing battle to maintain control of the household, Bucky's never-ending quest to consume a monkey, or Satchel's innocent view of the world, there's something everyone can enjoy and relate to in this little gem of a comic strip. It is one of the most witty, refreshing, and downright funny stips to come along in a long time. Best of all, this daily calendar provides me with a laugh almost every day. If there's any downside to it, it's that I don't throw away the previous strips. There are just too many good Get Fuzzy strips to justify getting rid of them. If you're limited on space at home, or spend your day at the office in a veal cube like I do, this would be the perfect addition to bring a little laughter to an otherwise mundane day. I'm just about through my 2006 calendar and have an order in for the 2007 version. I need my daily quota of "Get Fuzzy"! 
"Impact" is a book my school has used for nearly a decade as an introduction to the short story, literary issues, and writing projects. An excellent selection of 50 short-short stories, "Impact" follows up each story with a discussion of some appropriate literary term, a selection of questions that are actually worth answering (as a teacher, I know how bad these usually are), and some really innovative writing topics. The stories are all first-rate, from Shirley Jackson's "Charles" to Hemingway's "The Old Man at the Bridge" to Arthur C. Clarke's "Who's There?" Most of the stories also hinge on some ironic twist, allowing that most difficult and valuable of literary concepts to be taught thoroughly. Although a bit pricey for purchase just to read, "Impact" is also an excellent collection for anybody aspiring to write short stories. They simply don't get much better than these 
During a very difficult stage in my life the Lord led me to this book. It is without a doubt one of my favourites. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. Why? Well it teaches on lust and the reason we are sometimes tied to others in relationships that may sometimes not even be God's will for our lives. This is the first review I have ever written for any book I have read - and I do read a lot - and I am doing so because I truly feel that this book holds such vital information. 
I had originally purchased the 1st printing of this book and gave many of them away. The cover was different and oh how I wish I had it now! This book is great! I cant really add anymore than what others have added here, but I can say please read this book, everyone should have this information under their belts. I would however recommend reading The Beautiful side of evil. Like many they are unable to see the reality of satan's plans to get us off into something that can be so destructive and even move us out of God's truth. See how this women was fooled into thinking something she was doing was from God and then how God reveals the truth to her. Much the same about Garry's book, who by the way I have personally met. The only difference between the 2 books is the story it tells 
This book is great for people "with a past." It gives many examples of problems that have resulted from easily made mistakes. It tells you how to avoid these mistakes yourself and how to build a foundation so these mistakes won't even come into play. Through the use of personal and second-hand experience as well as scripture, Dr. Greenwald teaches how to build a relationship with God and avoid and diminish relations with the Devil. Absolutely amazing 
This book offers invaluable insight to understanding soul ties and why it is imperative that they be broken. It is a must read for people who are in relationships and still struggle with their attraction to their previous mates. This book definitely sheds light on why the struggle exists and how to break the soul tie. It is a personal favorite for me. I recommend it to any single or married person 
Anyone at all interested in Mexico should read this book. This book is written in a style ala James Mitchner. It deals with a huge period of time, starting before the time of the Aztecs and moves through to modern times. The author keeps it exciting and accurate. He covers the highlights of Mexico City and because of it's governmental centralization, the Country of Mexico itself, without becoming overly bogged down in detail. If you are a fan of historical novels, this is a book you won't be able to put down 
La Capital tells an absorbing story by following the twists and turns of the history of Mexico City. The writing style is clear yet the author also gives a comprehensive history of the Mexican capital. Of special note are the many anecdotes which provide much of the human interest for the reader. My favourite was the story of Irma Serrena "La Tigresa", a presidential mistress 
Un libro que se lee sin mayor dificultad gracias al lenguaje sencillo pero preciso, y en esto radica la magia del autor que de ese modo nos motiva a continuar. Libre de tecnicismos antropolgicos o histricos esta obra es recomendable para todo aquel que desee enterarse sobre Mxico con una visin clara, veraz y hasta divertida 
This is the definitive work on history of Mexico City. For the student of Mexican history this is a well documented work. For the casual reader it reads like a novel. It should not be out of print 
As a resident of Mexico City, who has studied its history, La Capital by Jonathan Kandell is the finest example of what a history book can be. It reads like a page-turner mystery and the publisher should hang their head in shame that the book has not been reprinted. I'll run out today and buy whatever copies are left in Mexico, to give as gifts in the future 
I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands 
Hofstadter tickles every curious and philosophical bone in your body. This one is a long read with a lot of dense material. If you take the time to get through it, while understanding all of it (this ain't no dime novel!), you will find yourself sitting on such a mental high as you cannot yet imagine. Plus, you get to boast to all of your nerdy friends that you have read "GEB", but thats just a perk 
This is Professor Hofstadter's Thesis. Those thinking about reading this book should do some research before doing so since it is over 25 years old... Perhaps that will level set expectations, so that you might objectively evaluate it's merit, and make an informed decision on whether or not it is a good investment for you individually... But then that would be exercising exactly what this book is about... Put that in your pipe and smoke it! If you are intrigued and fascinated by what it means to be human and have a Mind... If you are the type who wonders... Why, or more importantly, how do I wonder? Then you owe it to yourself to read this book... Even if like me, you struggle to comprehend it and read it many, many times until the light grows from a flicker to a full on fire, you will appreciate your self-discipline in the end. This book absolutely stands on it's own as an illuminating discourse on how the animate springs forth from the inanimate. If you don't like it, put it down and read something you do enjoy, but don't take it personal and attack the author. Good, bad, or indifferent this book represents a monumental achievement for a brilliant human mind, and that is irrefutable. Whether or not this is your "cup-of-tea" is inconsequential, we should all be thankful for people like Professor Hofstadter, who dare to live without self-imposed limits, and take on the monumental effort of expanding the human collective consciousness 
Whenever I read a book in translation I often wonder if it's the translator I love or hate, or the author themselves. Literature in translation is essentially a complete re-writing of the book itself. Consider Lewis Carroll: How does one go about translating seemingly endless word play and words that are often made up? Now consider the fact that Alice in Wonderland had been translated into over 50 languages. If you could read all 50 languages, some would approximate your understanding of "Alice", and some would appear tangenital, or worse, dishonest to the original. Machine Translation (MT) is considered AI's hardest problem, and Hofstadter goes to painstaking length to show just why this is so. Despite marketing rhetoric he points out why such a solution is years in the making if it ever occurs at all (to a satisfactory degree - meaning literature, not technical documents). Though many who have read "Gï¿½del, Escher, Bach" or "Metamagical Themas" are sometimes disappointed in this book, to me it is part of the evolution. And being a word geek, a polyglot, and in the constant companion of one who makes translation a living, I have to say this book rates above those other tombs on my list. But be forewarned, you are leaving the world of complex algorithms and entering a world where just such analysis is not forthcoming. 
I read this book in 1980, and each chapter of it still stands out in my mind in glittering bas-relief against all I read before or have read since. What stands out the most, however, is that my thinking changed after reading this book. Everything since reading it has been inevitably processed through its filter, which has quite simply changed my life. Perhaps a first-reading today would not have an equal effect; in 1980 it was timely. Things we take for granted now were difficult to conceptualize then--the internet, for instance. But I'll leave it for contemporary readers to decide whether Gï¿½del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is as eternal as the title claims. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. I can say without doubt that my life would have been different if I had not read it at that time. Ok, if it's so great, then what is it that makes it so? Trying to describe what is great about this book is like trying to say what is great about a particular Bach Fugue, or an Escher print. A fugue doesn't typically have a great melody. The rhythm can be monotonous and predictable. You know where it begins and where it will end up, and the subjects will enter on cue and not deviate from their lines. Escher's prints, similarly, are composed of mediocre representations of their subjects. Shading is not sublime, some of the features may be grotesque. What is it, then, that makes that fugue or that print great? Ahhh... that's the subject of this book, and in beautifully crafted recursion, its own principles apply equally to itself. You will come away with an understanding of the underlying principles of intelligence, beauty, craft, logic, and universal principles of creation. A deeper appreciation for those things does not necessarily mean a simpler or easier means of describing same. In fact, it may be the opposite, sort of "the more you know, the more you know you don't know." This confrontation with, and participation in, the infinite seems to be the root of our longing--a sense that Bach, Escher, and Gï¿½del weaved intuitively into their own work without feeling compelled to explain. So, rather than expect to come away from this book with the answers to the big quiz of life, I would say what one is more likely to find is a deepening of "mu," a rendering of knowledge into its proper place where "answers" in the Western sense dissolve into the questions in a deepening spiral of association and metaphor to the point at which one sees so many possibilities that the original question loses its significance. So is it nirvana? Not this book. But one may get caught up in the craft of the author and his inspirations to the point that one might feel lifted up and deposited at the trailhead of a new path, and the best that one can expect in this life is a new, sublime path. I think Hofstadter would agree that nirvana, should it exist, is the path, not the destination, and this book may well prove the author to be a willing bodhisattva. Shooshi 
This book is a great way to expose yourself to new ideas, but, in the words of a previous reviewer, it was written by a passionate dilettante. Its treatment of Godel's proof is occasionally great, but it is sometimes excessively obfuscatory, and sometimes even just plain wrong. I think this book is extremely clever, and I encourage almost anyone to read it, but take everything it says with a grain of salt. It's a great way to start yourself thinking about some fascinating things, but don't take the book too seriously. IF YOU WANT A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF GODEL'S PROOF: read "Godel's Proof" by Nagel and Newman, and then read a good translation of Godel's paper itself. GEB is clever and inspired, but it should not be taken too seriously 
Plainly put, this book was a ride. Standing back from a distance and looking at what the author has done really can put you in awe - the sheer scope of this work is breathtaking. He digs into many different scientific, mathematical, and artistic disciplines, and somehow manages to work them all together into a sometimes confusing, but ultimately satisfying whole. The short dialogues that fit in between each chapter are clever and always thought-provoking, but the bulk of this book's worth comes in the chapters. From the beginning to the end, I constantly found myself having to stop and rethink my perspective on many subjects. As the end of the book nears, he wraps it up by theorizing profoundly on the then-blooming subject of artificial intelligence. While parts of this are dated by this point, much of it isn't, and that is a testament to Hofstadter's powerful intellect and foresight. As you may have guessed from my review's title, this is not a summer beach read. Admittedly I am not the world's fastest reader, but this one took me a few months to complete (I would often put it down for a stretch and pick it up again some time later). So take your time with this one - enjoy it, reread passages you didn't understand the first time, and maybe pick up a different, easier book when you feel bogged down. But for anyone with any interest in mathematics, computer science, or the philosophy of the human mind, this is a must-have and well worth all the time you can give it 
I spent a good part of the day yesterday beggining a reading of GEB and was fascinated at the way Hofstadter looked at language and Bach's canons and fugues. And there is much to come, I can tell. Although I consider myself an intellectual, I am not qualified enough in mathematics to really understand what is being said on the subject, but hope that Hofstedter is going to open that up for me, too 
It's the gifted individual who can make math fun: it takes a complete master to do the same with Godel's Theorem. Godel, Escher, Bach was first recommended to me by my piano accompanist three years ago. I flipped through it--it looked too bizarre and eclectic to bother with. Three years later, when I finally did start reading it, I couldn't put it down. Hofstadter is entertaining, fascinating, earnest, and--above all--unbelievably clever. The puns littered throughout, the triple-decker meanings, the symphonic weaving of the work is enchanting from start to finish. I can't imagine anyone not gaining something from this book, not seeing the world differently after it was finished. Logic seems different to me, music different, truth and math and reality different. And there are moments of just the purest wonder within, moments when I felt almost hyponotized, ready to find out that I was a character within somebody else's book, maybe a Djinn or a God Over one. I admit that even in this easily digestible presentation, I couldn't fully understand the Godelian proof--though I grokked the gist of it. It's no matter though--there's so much within here that I won't spell it out or explicate it, only point out that it is what is claims to be: a synthesis of the three titular men, a work of gold 
This book is a masterpiece for me. It accompanied me throughout a long journey that I took in Europe in the past. It is written in a poetic way that makes you think, reflect and enter into the fantastic world of the invisible cities of Kublai Khan's empire, created by Calvino. Marco Polo works for the Khan. He has to visit many towns of the Mongolian empire so that later he can share his impressions with the great Khan. This is mainly because the empire is so big that Kublai Khan would never be able to visit all towns of his empire. Each chapter has the name of a town, which is described by Marco Polo. In addition, there are many dialogs between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo that are, in my point of view, the most exciting part of the book. The dialogs are so intelligent and stimulating that I read some of them many times. They can trigger our natural curiosity about the way we see things around us, the future, the past, the present, etc. It is a book to be read in a slow pace so we can reflect upon each part. It helped me to slow down my frequently rushed rhythm of life. How conscious are we while we write the pages of our lives? 
Consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, Calvino's fiction is sui generis, a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory-oriented "If On A Winter's Night A Traveler." This is the kind of novel Borges might have written. A celebration of the unbridled imagination, "Invisible Cities" is also, I am convinced, a secret love letter to a single city: the imaginary dream-city of Venice, a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea 
Generally I like my books fast and plot-driven, with minimal description and at least quasi-linear plots lines. While Invisible Cities is none of those things, I would rate it among my favorite books. The prose is incredible, rich, almost erotic. At times I felt my heart beating faster as I read it. This is a book to linger inside of, to re-read often, to keep by your bedside to read snatches of before you go to sleep. 
This book has become my favorite, equal to a few others, but unsurpassed in its brilliance to me through its poignant insights, fantastic imagery, Calvino's exploration of his willingness to write in abstract terms, and, for lack of a better way of describing it, the sunlight that beams from nearly every page of this book. As others have written, to describe, or to try to describe the contents of this book quickly becomes irrelevant, for Calvino has opened doors through which, city by city, the reader not only visits but constructs cities of his own. This book, while short, is, nonetheless, the only one I have read twice in a row. Could be it's just my type of thing... I don't know. If you're a fan of science fiction, fantasy, or simply looking for a beautifully mysterious distraction, put it in your cart, check out, and wait by your door 
I read this decades ago, when I was barely more than a child. It is a brief volume. I recall that I burned through the first 50 pages before I even realized what was going on. Then I had to start over from the beginning so that I could really begin to appreciate it. This is a novel that fulfills all the usual requirements of a novel. But just not in any of the usual ways of a novel. There is poetry in it. And ideas. Ideas that shed light on ideas. And ideas that shed light on ideas, and maybe on people, but definitely on ideas. If you want something different, but not painful, then this might be it. But it wants to make you think, as Calvino usually does, so it might seem a little bit boring or tedious until you make the effort to try to understand. There's trying, and there's succeeding. All you have to do with this one is to try. Whether or not you succeed doesn't matter. If you just try, you'll have fun. Or at least that's what I recall from decades ago when I still expected greatness in this world. YMMV, ^ 
Immediately I can detect the luminous presence of magic in this slim volume. Although thin in pages, it is deep in meaning. Without much in the way of characters or plot, it sustains and enlightens. Laconic descriptions of fantastic cities woven together in a tapestry of voluminous nuance. Topics of memory, perception, vision, time, loss, longing, desire, death, signs, symbols and ultimately meaning are all carefully chosen and arrayed. Upon finishing this book, one has the feeling of have eaten a delicious meal too quickly. That upon reflection, it should have been savoured slowly 
The writing is pure seduction, whimsical, enchanting, all those words which mean totally freaking dreamy. The problem is, for me at least, that it's the sort of book that I can't read straight through. It might take me a few weeks or a year. Probably because there isn't a plot to speak of. Anyway, expect poetry, get poetry. And don't let go of your copy because it'll never come back. Mine didn't 
I was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good detox-read. To me the book was far from the brainless entertainment I was hoping for. In fact, Invisible Cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublia Khan. At first I was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities. Through Calvino's use of symbolism I began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations. This could have been the first time I really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams. With all of the above said, one problem I had when reading Invisible Cities was my mind seemed to easily drift off the page. The book reads more like poetry then a novella and I felt that halfway through the book the form of the chapters became almost too redundant. I think that if I were to re-read the book and spend some time with it I could have gained greater insight into Italo Calinvo's perspective and creative mind. Although I am not rushing to re-read it anytime soon, I would possibly read it again in the future 
Readers and fans of Calvino's Invisible Cities may be interested to know that an entire hotel has been hand-crafted on the theme of the book. It is located on the Balearic Island of Menorca, in Spain. Each room is based on a different 'invisible city'. I've seen it, it's amazing, no, it's overwhelming, astonishing.

My brother picked this book up in an airport on the way to Mexico with my family. He was literally laughing out loud for days and relayed sotries to me and my dad. I decided when he finished it, I'd give it a go, though I was unsure about some of the author's views on women. But let me say in short that I, as a 22 year old female, LOVED THE HECK outta this book. I picked up it one night and didn't put it down until I finished it in the wee hours of the morning. I had never read a book all the way through in one sitting before and doubt I ever will again (unless I pick this one up again). I laughed so hard at times I almost peed my pants. I was jealous of all the adventures Tucker Max had (on top of his moderate success) and kind of ticked that there was no way a woman could have such adventures, let alone write an incredible book about it.  As many others pointed out, it's not a book that offers a grand awakening at the end, giving you the warm and fuzzies. But it will make you laugh, and your friends WILL thank you for passing it on 
For starters this book is a good read, I rarely read and I knocked it out in a day and a half. Once you start reading it you won't be able to put it down. You will talk about it with your friends and they will be clueless about what you are saying but you will not be able to stop. So eventually they will want to read it and think you are the coolest guy ever for passing this book onto them. If you like to party, drink, sleep with girls, treat others with complete disrespect, and basically live life to its fullest you will kill for this book. Have a good day and next time I see you, you better be Tucker Max drunk (yeah read it and find out what that is punk! 
Tucker Max is going to hell....and I gladly followed. Reading his book brought non-stop laughs...and the occasional brimstone scorch. I have been lucky enought to have a friend like this...and realize...life is better than it could have ever been because of it 
If you just want to be entertained and dont mind if not a single deep thought will pass through your read while you read then this book is perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed...everyone wishes they had a Tucker Max in their life, cuz we've gotta live vicariously through someone...now we do and we can. 
Yes... I'm an actual girl who purchased this book, read it, and laughed until I cried. If you aren't easily offended and enjoy a good drunken story, please -- buy the book 
Those of us who have been to college usually know at least one crazy guy who was always the life of the party and constantly entertained the campus with his antics. Tucker Max is not one of these people. Tucker is nothing more than a standard belligerent, mean drunk. The type of guy who always ends up trying to start fights with people for no reason and then runs away if it actually comes to blows. The type of guy who is constantly bragging about how much [...] he gets, when no one has ever seen him so much as kiss a girl. I kept expecting Tucker to blurt out "My dad totally owns a Dealership!" Nothing truly insane happens in this book, it's mainly just Tucker and his buddies getting drunk and being jerks towards everyone they encounter. Generally, the typical behavior you might expect from someone who refers to himself in the third person. In most of these stories, Tucker makes himself out to be some sort of supermack that can screw any girl in a matter of seconds. This just seems a bit off for a guy whose original claim to fame involved trying to land a girlfriend online. I almost forgot to mention. Tucker Max has been outed as a fraud by Opie and Anthony and by the Miami Herald. None of these stories are true. He is just another James Frey. 
As a great fan of stand up and great comedy, I felt it was needed of me to buy this book. It was never any regrets about it. This book had me lying on the floor laughing several times, and is most lightly the best written piece of humor I have ever read. I think this is a great book which everyone with a sence of humor should experience 
great stories, crazy and simple, great lessons. first book to have me laughing. 
This is a seriously funny book, as long as you are the sorta person who laughs when a mate farts. I laughed so hard that at one stage I had to stop reading the book because I had tears in my eyes 
"Journey to the Land of No" is a first-person memoir of a Jewish girl growing up in Iran during the Revolution. The book describes what her life and the life of her family was like before and after this cataclysmic event. Having developed an unaccountable interest in the Iranian Revolution during the past year, I have read perhaps a dozen books about this subject. Hakakian's book, while not bad, would have to be toward the bottom of the list of books you should read about this subject. It just didn't grab me. And certainly there has been no shortage of books written by women who lived in Iran during the Revolution and have since escaped. But if you're only going to read one or two, there is much better fare out there. "Reading Lolita in Tehran" is searing and unforgettable, and the graphic novel "Persepolis" is simply excoriating. This latter would be at the top of said list. Yeah, the competition is pretty stiff these days. The bar for writing an "I'm an Iranian exile and here's why"-type book has been set incredibly high by so much good stuff out there now, and Hakakian's effort doesn't quite measure up. Anyhow. Compared to harrowing books like those, Hakakian's story is -- dare I say it? -- ho-hum. Occasionally it is tenderly written, but I left the book feeling that she had little to say, and because, at least compared to other authors writing about the same subject, little remarkable happened to her. What is most regrettable about the book, I suppose, is that Hakakian's Jewishness is almost incidental to her tale. This is sad. She certainly mentions that she was Jewish, and this does form the cornerstone for a few events in the story, but basically what happens to her and her family could have happened to pretty much any Iranian during that time. And this is regrettable because the Jewish angle was the one really original thing this book had going for it. And the author, I must aver, failed to really explore it or make it come alive. In fact, so forgettable is the whole outing that, a few weeks after having read this book, I am unable to recall a single incident from it 
Amazing story, beautifully written. It has all the elements of an exciting novel, and it is true, which makes it even more awesome 
A Persian friend gave me this book. I couldn't put it down, so poetic and real. As we live in times of war and devastation, this book reminds us of the power of ideologies and politics. It is about the turmoil of war and the price that innocent people pay so others can prosper and prove a point!! You feel the love of a country and the sadness losing that land, the uprooting of your beliefs in the voice of Roya. Her description is so vivid and sentimental. I am not sure if her suffering pertains to one sect or race, I think she meant to portray the universal downfall of humanity and the blindness of extreme 
Reading Roya's accounting of her ordeal gives one a profound feeling of the reality of the time. It is amazing that Roya's experience had such an effect on her that the details still remain intact for her reproduce such an amazing book 
Laugh, cry, remember and connect to home! Roya makes you do all that, especially if you grew up in Iran @ the beginning of the revolution. enjoy and pass it along to all the women in your family 
Roya Hakakian comes from a secular Jewish family who identifies with Iran. The family is integrated into Iranian life and Roya looks forward to the wonderful changes that will come with the Revolution. This is the story about the changes that came to the ordinary people of Iran. The dying of hope, the hopelessness of change. The story covers the lives of the Hakakian family, singled out for being Jewish, and the lives of the Moslem and Jewish families they know and who are their friends. This is not a happy story. It brings down to the indiviual level the failure of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. 
The somber cover, the title, and the reference to prison abuses at the opening of this book are a little misleading. This memoir is not especially dark or grim, and the journey it recounts is an internal one, more from the land of "yes" than "no." It captures that particular youthful optimism that buoys up children and adolescents in the worst of times. And the Islamic revolution in Iran becomes the worst of times for the community of 100,000 Jews living in Tehran in the late 1970s, as the monarchy is toppled and the Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile to assume power. Hakakian's book is a vividly and wonderfully remembered account of her coming of age in these tumultuous years. The equally gifted younger sister of three precocious brothers, an admitted "class clown," she happily plays her own growing self-confidence and self-awareness against the reader's knowledge of coming events. Through her, we experience the almost universal public euphoria that followed the fall of the Shah, and while she chooses to discount its significance, we see mounting evidence of the approaching political and social forces that will finally drive her family to join the Jewish exodus from Iran. This is a fine, well-written book, often entertaining and sometimes starkly moving. The parallels Hakakian draws to Orwell's "1984" illustrate the gradual erosion of self that occurs when the state attempts to control individuals' thoughts and desires. In this and other ways, it's an excellent companion to Nafisi's "Reading Lolita in Tehran.
