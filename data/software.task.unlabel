I already owned BOA 615,000 as well as the 2 - 50,000 Photo Objects collections. BOA 1 Million was a great addition to this collection. The search engine is fast and locates the other catalogs. I placed all the CD's on a data drive so that there is no CD swapping needed. Not sure how product support or future plans are going to be. I haven't needed any yet. Hemera seems to have sold these products to Encore USA. Some of their links do not work but support is found at [...] It you need to locate graphics to use in presentations then this is an excellent product. I am pleased with it 
Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!! And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep. This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale. There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements. 
I won't include my website URL here, but I'm a professional photographer, who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions. I've been using Photoshop since version 5.0, roughly 6-7 years. Frankly, I'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of Photoshop CS2, and that overall the product only gets three stars. I understand all the frustration, though. Even on a top-of-the-line machine, "PS CS2" can be slow at times. However, in my case, that's because I'm working on incredibly large files. For example, my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images. By the time multiple layers are added in PS, one image file can be 500 MB - 1 GB in size. This is exactly why I have a dual-Opteron system with 4 GB of RAM: so I can work on these monster files in Photoshop! For me, Photoshop is a must-have. There are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what I want to get done. I don't even want to mention all the advanced features that I use on a daily basis, frankly because that's part of my edge as a professional. I've spent over five years working in PS everyday, and have carefully studied several advanced books on PS. The learning curve is long, but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards. Yeah, Adobe's got some major improvements to make, along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned. For me, the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory. And I would agree with other reviewers here that for most people, the full Photoshop CS2 is probably a waste of money. Photoshop Elements is probably a better way to go, though I haven't used it personally. I know a good web designer who uses Paint Shop Pro, and who seems to be happy. IMHO, some people are probably drawn to Photoshop the way others are drawn to AutoCad or Solidworks or 3D Studio Max. All these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user. You can't make a career out of PS Elements, or Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP, or whatever else other reviewers may mention. PS CS2 is "the standard" for image manipulation 
I still have a LOT of learning to do, but just what I've been able to do with photos the last 2 weeks is amazing. I don't know why I waited so long to buy this thing 
I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant 
I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade..... 
I have viewed PDF files for years, never made one before. The installation was simple, and converting Word, Excel or other files to PDF is one click away. Only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied 
I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game. 
I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue fun just keep getting better better. In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion. He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture. Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion. Could they be related some how? As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette the stolen artwork. Overall, I loved "Danger by Design". It has the best graphics to date for an ND game it was great fun to play. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series. 
Having seen this product demonstrated at a recent photographic conference I purchased it as soon as I got home. When it arrived I immediately calibrated my PC monitor and Epson digital projector. The process is very simple with easy to follow screen prompts that walk you through the process. My images have been taken to a new level of color accuracy. This was the best investment I could have made to advance my photograpic color accuracy 
It does the basic job well. The calibration runs smoothly and accurately. Hardware looks and feels solid. My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side.  User interface is merely adequate. Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen. You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software). In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over. Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over. Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier. You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list. Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version. Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk. It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards. If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup. This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs, or on the box. Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP. After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor. You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default. Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles. And check it after you open the application. I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.   
The name says it all. It's a great program for custom sizing your hard drive especially for store bought computers that have only one partition. I've had this program since version 7 and have used it on several computers.Computer novices can easily learn how to use this progra 
Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2. I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD. Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done. Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running 
I installed a WD 320G usb drive to use as a backup drive. I used the HD backup software to do auto backups. Unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and I could not use it as you would a normal drive (Drag n drop)or access a particular file. I used Partition Magic to reclaim my USB drive and in the process I partitioned the drive. The drive now works as I want it to I have control! Partition Magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job. 
I love this Adobe product. It works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that's only a minor annoyance. Overall it is a very good product 
Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast. Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation; Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens. With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer 
I have yet to make a card with this software, but that is by choice...I prefer photo cards, and find it's easier to make the outside of a card with my Canon photo software, and the inside with Digital Image. I love the stationery section on this, however...lots of choices of paper designs, and it's very easy to use. I just can't figure out how to make the text larger, if you can. When you're typing up your letter, it has LARGE text; when you print your letter it has SMALL text. Making an envelope is easy, too...it's the only easy software I have for that! Only, I have to go to my Control Panel to click in my Canon printer properties to change the paper type to envelope. The Hallmark software doesn't allow this--at least not the envelopes that directly follow stationery printing, although it allows it when printing your letter. If I don't change the Canon to envelope, I'm left with ink tracks on my envelopes. (There is a separate envelope category, however, that I haven't used. Maybe that one brings up the printer properties.) There are loads of fun projects in this software, and it's a very colorful software. About installation...mine was a nightmare. Disc 1 was the only one that would download. The other two just froze my PC. I discovered that I was changing the discs too quick. If I waited at least a few minutes between changing discs it installed fine. I almost gave up on it, however, but am glad I didn't 
with plenty of opportunity to be creative. The only downfall is that there is no way to download more cards from the internet. All in all though, I would highly recommend this software 
Help! This program will not let me print all of my address's unto christmas labels. When you go down to the arrow to check all address's it will not move. Any Help would be appreciated. Thank 
I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive. Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!). I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run 
How quickly people forget the pain of managing RAW images with just the operating system and a copy of Photoshop. Thanks to Aperture (and its subsequent imitators) managing (and interacting with) huge RAW libraries becomes invisible and easy. I specifically like the full-screen mode, which puts the images front and center. Likewise, the Loupe tool lets you check focus on an image without taking the focus (no pun intended) away from the photography. And you can make changes to the images without having to convert them, then edit them, then hit Save-As everytime you have a new idea. Aperture is completely non-destructive. The RAW image is loaded and adjustments to it are tracked seperately (yet seamlessly) so that you never have to worry about losing your master. There's a lot more in the app beyond these things, which is what makes it such an amazing piece of software. Its a digital SLR's best friend 
I do quite a bit of teaching, so the latest versions of Power Point and Word are very useful to me. This software does feature some significant improvements of the 2000 edition, such as better presentation formats and backgrounds for Power Point, easier inclusion of graphics, animations, etc., and the new features for Word are also nice improvements. The price for these upgrades was reasonable as well 
Love this product. I like having these Microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios 
I am pleased with the product. I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it. All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it. Very easy. I bought it for my daughter, who is in college. I also have a son in the fourth grade, and I know that it will be useful for him, too. I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer 
This is as of today, the best office suite from microsoft that I've owned 
I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade. So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program 
I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD 
I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual. It practically loaded and started itself. Overall, I am very impressed. The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design. I better read the book again. I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas 
This is a good software for casual use (hiking, biking, geocaching), but not without issues. On the positive side, it definitely beats all non-digital (scanned USGS maps) alternatives. The level of details is good enough(how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet?). The fact that maps are digitally generated (with vectors I believe) makes all the labels clear at any scale. It has two advantages over its main "digital" competitor, NG Topo. First, all of the US is on one DVD for the price of separate state/region CDs from NG. And second, it is available. I could not even find NG's Northeast edition anywhere on the web! One might think NH and ME are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations. Now the few negatives. The Exchange feature with GPS is flaky. Sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my Garmin. Part of it could be that low and mid range GPS still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with COM-to-USB adapter (beats me why Garmin can't make all their GPS with USB in this day and age). In any case, regardless of whose fault it is, it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly. The second problem I noticed was with the 3-D window. It clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if I do a lot of rapid rescaling. I ended up just closing that window, since it is pretty much for "coolness" and does not add any real topographical value. Finally, I had a problem with Delorme's service. I purchased it from Amazon with a rebate offer. However, a month after submitting the necessary info I received a card from Delorme stating that the bar code I sent was not a UPC code. The box only had one bar code on it so I am not sure how I could have made a mistake. They requested that I send a correct one, but with the code cut out and gone, how do they expect me to come up with one?! I feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it. I would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem. 
I recently bought this version of Windows XP on Amazon.com after the release of Apple's Boot Camp. I printed out the installation instructions and followed the meticulously after setting up my new Macintosh. I then installed this software, installed antivirus (and other software like Office, Publisher, Visio, SimCity), and I updated the Windows OS. Everything operates as well as on my old pc, except it runs A LOT FASTER. I have a mac with 1 gig ram, dual-core intel processor, and a mammoth harddrive (4 times bigger than my Compaq), and I can access the corporate intranet, LiveMeeting, and other apps with so much ease. When I am done, I reboot and I am back to my Mac. Give it a whirl. It is awesome 
I agree, Windows could improve thier products but I'm not going to jump on the Linux bandwagon just yet. You can get this product Academic for 84.00 on the web. I own several copies for my home computers. If you network and use wireless this is the program to use. I use both Unix and Windows at work and the Unix is far more stable. Compatibility issues are what kills Unix/Linux for now and Linux is not user friendly. In the future Apple and Linux will have some of the same issues as Windows to deal with as they become more popular. Windows dominates for a reason. Also, when you upgrade select full install and not the upgrade. You will need a full version copy of Windows 98, Windows Me, or Windows 2000 to accomplish this. Registering your software with Microsoft is virtually painless, even if you need a new key. You can load Windows five times before your key expires. At that point you can call them for a new one. I'd buy this product again and Amazon is a great company to deal with- FIVE STARS to them!! 
I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go. For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it 
I have been using Kodak software for years to edit my pictures. Corel makes it easy to back pictures up and move them around. The editing software is extremely easy to use giving three choices for each option. There are also a lot of creative options as well. I highly recommend this software to everyone!! 
Very easy to use software. My best purchase to date. Have told many of my friends and they have fallen in love with it like I have 
I had a much earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio and really liked it. I think this new version (Deluxe 2006) is even better. This program is so easy to use and yet able to create some beautiful cards. My favorite part of the program is the Event Planner. The reminders are wonderful. I haven't missed a lecture, appointment, or any other time commitment since loading this program. I love the fact that I can set reminders for days and days ahead. Get this set for yourself and don't be afraid to get it for someone who is not too computer savvy. It should satisfy any user. 
This is a good product. My only complant is that you have to adjust the wording on almost every card to print correctly...maybe its user error...otherwise I like it 
I rate this 5 stars based on my knowledge of the Fantastic Four and X-Men complete editions. I'm writing this review to warn people about my receiving 2 defective copies of the Spider-Man version from Amazon. I'll have to try a 3rd time 
I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review. I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT 
Cool....read all the classic issues without getting french fry grease all over you collector's items 
Came quickly, was factory sealed, loaded-up as it should. Thanks: Dale Tollefso 
I don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about, but this program is only capable of going as far as your knowledge of the tools of the program. Quite honestly, Adobe Illustrator does not have as "steep" a learning curve as most people claim. With that, I HIGHLY recommend any beginner to get the Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann. (You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training") It has to be one of the BEST most thorough book to get you introduced into the program, and for about $20, is so much BETTER than what most college "intro" computer courses offer for $200-400. Now as for Illustrator CS2, most of the newest features have left me very satisfied with the upgrade. Especially the inclusion of "Live Trace" (eliminating the former "auto-trace" tool), with it's multiple tracing modes, makes converting bitmap images to vectors SO easy. Another feature I love is the top control palette, similar to that of Photoshop, which makes accessing options much easier. The only decision you might be faced with is whether these new features are worth the price of the upgrade (that is, unless your a student) 
A great way to manage projects and share with others in your group. Not intuitive to learn, though 
One could say that this is the standard by which all other project management software is measured ... but there are no others that compare. For better or for worse, Microsoft dominates this software segment like no other. However, instead of resting on its market share, MS keeps improving its product. In more than 5 years as a professional project manager at a Fortune 500 company, I have never seen another software product in daily use other than Project ... although I'm sure they are out there somewhere. If you require others to share your files and for your project plans to be backwardly compatible years into the future, you really shouldn't consider anything else. But don't be dismayed, this is well-designed software that is surprisingly easy to learn, use and an immediate, out-of-the-box time-saver. The bottom line is still incredible value, even more so if you qualify for the low-price Academic Version, as I did while taking a continuing ed project management course 
After removing Symantec and installing Zonealarm my computer speeded up by a factor of at least 10. I'm not certain why Symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast - in my case it insisted on scanning every program transferred and used and on scanning every outgoing email even though I truned those features off. I recommend Zonealarm for users with some expertise - during the initial usage you need to understand what programs to allow and what to block (look them up on Google) 
I installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and I find that it gives me wonderful protection. I would recommend this product to everyone. I am very satisfied. I feel my computer is very well protected 
Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar) 
This software is very user friendly,easy to install, easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone 
Given that this is a stripped down version of some of Sonic Foundry's more powerful (and expensive) professional tools, Acid Music 3.0 is still a pleasant surprise. I had it set up on my computer within ten minutes, and with very little tutoring from the instruction guide, was able to browse to the music loop library, "paint" out loops on the multi-track display, modify loop characteristics like reverb and bass, and so forth. Obviously, Acid Music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone. This software cannot generate its own unique loops, so I wound up having to find a MIDI program that would let me create original loops for making truly original music. But as a non-musician who hosts a radio program and is a bona fide electronic music fan, Acid Music 3.0 made it super easy to assemble my MIDI tracks into pretty good sounding pieces. I would recommend this program to anyone, musician or non-musician, interested in breaking into the world of digital computer music creation. It's been almost three months since my wife gave me my copy as a gift, and I've managed to put together many different kinds of pieces of music, using both original content and the great loops that come with the program. It's a lot of fun, and has me hungering to see what more I can do with the thing 
This one is definately the best out of all of the previous ACID Music programs. It has a ton of loops, a really cool looking skin, and much more options than in ACID 1.0 or 2.0. It comes with two CDs. One of them has the application on it with some loops and the other CD has nothing but loops and demo songs! It has over 1,600 unique loops! Definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous ACID Musics 
This product, as well as other software developed by Sonic Foundry, is used in the gaming industry. It was even used to make the music in Summoner! I've been using this product for a while, and I have made tunes like THAT and saving them as MP3s, WAVs, and so forth. Heck, if I make a digital home video or something, I can rig it with music by adding the music in with ACID Music! Get this if you want to make games with tunes, show off to friends and make them say "Damn! You couldn't have made this!", or if you got other reasons to make some good music without needing to hire an orcastra (eat your heart out, John Williams) 
This is a good package for backing up your PC. Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup. It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup. The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process. You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time. Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work. 
That's a great product. I strongly recommend without hesitation. I had saved all of my data when my laptop was stolen. Easy to use and easy to restore data. Only I had a problem with e-mail restoration. Still I am glad I have bought this product. 
This is unbelievable---it can tell the importance of the stuff on my PC. And I also can set a Weekly Backup task on my PC. This is fantastic. It is so straigh forward and easy to use. I will definately recommend this product to everyone I know. Well done, Alohabob!!! 
With individual images from a photo library costing about as much as this whole collection, it's great value. I'm a beginner in the design business, and was encouraged by Robin Williams' design books to acquire resources. Art Explosion is certainly a great way to go. The large collection of fonts was an unexpected bonus. Only last night my son was looking for photos of fruit for a project he's working on, and Art Explosion came up with hundreds. I'm working images into various items that I write and the huge variety means I can find something to match the other elements. I did have a problem initially with a mislabelled disk. However an email to customer support and a replacement is on the way. A better search would be nice but I'm aware of the enormous task of tagging a collection this big, with no doubt a huge increase in cost. As it is I browse it with an ordinary file browser (which I actually find easier than the inbuilt catalogues) or search with a desktop search engine. Overall it's a great product 
I had access to the CD version of this product that came with the Image Library Catalog in the box. I liked using it and although there was a lot of CD disc-trading with 34 discs, it worked well for me. I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt. Later, I wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought. They had sent back all the CD editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the DVD edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ($4.95). Whenever I go to use the DVD's, I have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if I request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser. I would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information. The store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf (or so the stock personnel said). I am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it's included on the box but isn't, the extra money for the shipping, and the awkwardness to use this 'upgraded' product 
I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished! Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do. 
For many who like writing HTML/XHTML code, Homesite holds a special place in the heart. It just feels so right and is addictive. The tool can be extended, and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy. Support from MacroMedia has not been good. Now Adobe is in the process of buying Macromodia (as on 2005-04-19) so who knows where it all goes. Saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it. If it fits you don't need support. You just run it day after day and it works great. (There are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet. CSE and TopStyle are two that are coming along.) For some it almost seems perfect, for WYSIWYG oriented people, it might be best not to even look at it 
Great program but the fact that you can't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted. Homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by Alaire 
This is by far my favourite HER Interactive Nancy Drew PC game, and I have played them all multiple times. I loved the food aspect of it [my sister's a chef], in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting Nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious New England clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for Katie; AND calling Bess and George to hear how Bess is learning to cook from a TV show and hearing her worry about what she's making. The puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them; they were challenging but doable, took some moving about and kept the game adventurous. The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water. I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer 
extremely helpful and superior graphics and choices to change your computers them 
The name says it all. It's a great program for custom sizing your hard drive especially for store bought computers that have only one partition. I've had this program since version 7 and have used it on several computers.Computer novices can easily learn how to use this progra 
This is an easy product to use. It saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space. It will grab it from another hard drive. It is also useful in setting up a D: drive for Documents, and and E: drive for programs. It is useful to have windows on C: alone. There are fewer crashes. Michael Common 
It's a useful tool. Combined with another Norton's products GHOST, you can easily perform PC maintanence using these tools 
I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic. That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography. A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast. Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions. If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007 
Simply the best software out there for digital photographers, graphic designers and anything having to do with digital image creation and manipulation. Packed with features for novices to professional advanced users. The only limits are your imagination 
It has some nice upgrades from version 6. It is quicker than the previous version. Highlighting text is a bit easier. It caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports, but I found a patch for the officejet and all is well. It is a product that is helpful in my work 
I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal 
I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser. Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office. I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6. There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile. Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement. I recommend 
I have tried a few other photo editing products but I always come back to Adobe. Easy to use and excellent results 
I have yet to make a card with this software, but that is by choice...I prefer photo cards, and find it's easier to make the outside of a card with my Canon photo software, and the inside with Digital Image. I love the stationery section on this, however...lots of choices of paper designs, and it's very easy to use. I just can't figure out how to make the text larger, if you can. When you're typing up your letter, it has LARGE text; when you print your letter it has SMALL text. Making an envelope is easy, too...it's the only easy software I have for that! Only, I have to go to my Control Panel to click in my Canon printer properties to change the paper type to envelope. The Hallmark software doesn't allow this--at least not the envelopes that directly follow stationery printing, although it allows it when printing your letter. If I don't change the Canon to envelope, I'm left with ink tracks on my envelopes. (There is a separate envelope category, however, that I haven't used. Maybe that one brings up the printer properties.) There are loads of fun projects in this software, and it's a very colorful software. About installation...mine was a nightmare. Disc 1 was the only one that would download. The other two just froze my PC. I discovered that I was changing the discs too quick. If I waited at least a few minutes between changing discs it installed fine. I almost gave up on it, however, but am glad I didn't 
﻿Sandra; hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program. Check your printer drivers and spooler. I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want having played with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair, Kildall, and Adam Osborne. Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine several years back. Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - my lady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wish could import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palm conduit?!-)(I digress!-). Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery. In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER. Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to go beyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (little thing code name of Palladium!-( There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32. Try removing your printer under START &gt;SETTINGS &gt;PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on and reinstall. Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program. HB 
How quickly people forget the pain of managing RAW images with just the operating system and a copy of Photoshop. Thanks to Aperture (and its subsequent imitators) managing (and interacting with) huge RAW libraries becomes invisible and easy. I specifically like the full-screen mode, which puts the images front and center. Likewise, the Loupe tool lets you check focus on an image without taking the focus (no pun intended) away from the photography. And you can make changes to the images without having to convert them, then edit them, then hit Save-As everytime you have a new idea. Aperture is completely non-destructive. The RAW image is loaded and adjustments to it are tracked seperately (yet seamlessly) so that you never have to worry about losing your master. There's a lot more in the app beyond these things, which is what makes it such an amazing piece of software. Its a digital SLR's best friend 
I do quite a bit of teaching, so the latest versions of Power Point and Word are very useful to me. This software does feature some significant improvements of the 2000 edition, such as better presentation formats and backgrounds for Power Point, easier inclusion of graphics, animations, etc., and the new features for Word are also nice improvements. The price for these upgrades was reasonable as well 
My daughter likes it because it uses the same format her high school teachers use. Also, she likes the research tools that it provides. And, it's easy to use. It's very practical--she uses it a lot 
I am pleased with the product. I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it. All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it. Very easy. I bought it for my daughter, who is in college. I also have a son in the fourth grade, and I know that it will be useful for him, too. I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer 
This is as of today, the best office suite from microsoft that I've owned 
I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program. One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that. Get it! You won't be disappointed 
Worked as expected. A few hardware glitches but that was to be expected 
Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs. 
Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem. As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great. You do get a variety of photos of objects. For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries. For $17 this is definitely worth the money. I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor. Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes. There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like. I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection. Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web. Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper. For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet. 
I already owned BOA 615,000 as well as the 2 - 50,000 Photo Objects collections. BOA 1 Million was a great addition to this collection. The search engine is fast and locates the other catalogs. I placed all the CD's on a data drive so that there is no CD swapping needed. Not sure how product support or future plans are going to be. I haven't needed any yet. Hemera seems to have sold these products to Encore USA. Some of their links do not work but support is found at [...] It you need to locate graphics to use in presentations then this is an excellent product. I am pleased with it 
If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade. You won't be disappointed. Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award. Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base. The proof is in the new version of Illustrator. Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of. I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands. There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version. No fear here! First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together. We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer. We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment. Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more. Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in. Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins. Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing. This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation. After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up. Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette. I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop. Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking. Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line. This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later. When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color. Voila! You are done. Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes. A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes. Sometimes it became a little unmanageable. However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette. This new palette sits at the top of the screen. First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information. Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style. No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features. If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too. Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator: * Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces. You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates. * Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration. Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless. * Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette. * CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes * Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2. Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow. * Macromedia Flash exports are now available. You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects. * You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator. This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop * Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path. * Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements. * These are a few of the new features! The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone. However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2. Upgrade now and be completely satisfied. If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop. This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout. Loren Elks Group Manager, D-MAG.org 
I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual. It practically loaded and started itself. Overall, I am very impressed. The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design. I better read the book again. I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas 
Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics. Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive). Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed. Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design 
I recently bought this version of Windows XP on Amazon.com after the release of Apple's Boot Camp. I printed out the installation instructions and followed the meticulously after setting up my new Macintosh. I then installed this software, installed antivirus (and other software like Office, Publisher, Visio, SimCity), and I updated the Windows OS. Everything operates as well as on my old pc, except it runs A LOT FASTER. I have a mac with 1 gig ram, dual-core intel processor, and a mammoth harddrive (4 times bigger than my Compaq), and I can access the corporate intranet, LiveMeeting, and other apps with so much ease. When I am done, I reboot and I am back to my Mac. Give it a whirl. It is awesome 
I agree, Windows could improve thier products but I'm not going to jump on the Linux bandwagon just yet. You can get this product Academic for 84.00 on the web. I own several copies for my home computers. If you network and use wireless this is the program to use. I use both Unix and Windows at work and the Unix is far more stable. Compatibility issues are what kills Unix/Linux for now and Linux is not user friendly. In the future Apple and Linux will have some of the same issues as Windows to deal with as they become more popular. Windows dominates for a reason. Also, when you upgrade select full install and not the upgrade. You will need a full version copy of Windows 98, Windows Me, or Windows 2000 to accomplish this. Registering your software with Microsoft is virtually painless, even if you need a new key. You can load Windows five times before your key expires. At that point you can call them for a new one. I'd buy this product again and Amazon is a great company to deal with- FIVE STARS to them!! 
I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure. 
I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do. I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents. Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so. Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do. Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet. It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities. The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating? I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so. I'm being petulant 
I ordered the box version from Amazon, instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive, but the main reason was so that I would have a paper manual. So many programs don't come with hard copy manuals and I prefer them over on-line help. As for the program itself, I trialed a download first. For me, the thing I fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images, side by side, and compare them! It makes selecting the best image a breeze - a HUGE timesaver. You also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez. Another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images, and sliding it, will slide all the open previews simultaneously, so you don't have to individually zoom and move each image. You can do this with up to 6 images at a time! You can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the "h" key, which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review. While you've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image. The colors can be keyed to whatever description you want. I do "1=green" for yes, "2=yellow" for maybe, and "3=red" for no. There's room for quite a few more colors after that. I then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red "no" images and delete them. After I have all my green "yes" images, I then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings. I resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and I can start processing them. You can batch process file name, and some other things that I don't bother with, as well. It's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your Photoshop files. What's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own, with those keywords, are immediately shown in thumbnails! Finding an image is actually fun! It will even give you thumbnails of images you don't even store on your hard drive anymore! Fantastic program - I highly recommend it! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is b/c it's not all that intuitive. This is a read-the-manual kind of program, but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book. ;) 
I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos. I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first 
It does everything I hoped for and more!! As a new user of Acrobate, I am very definitely impressed... in part by the ease with which I am able to learn the program, as well as its functionality! 
I have been using Kodak software for years to edit my pictures. Corel makes it easy to back pictures up and move them around. The editing software is extremely easy to use giving three choices for each option. There are also a lot of creative options as well. I highly recommend this software to everyone!! 
The service was good and it came undamaged and the product was easy to use and it has been very satisfactory for my needs. The description of the product was accurate 
Very easy to use software. My best purchase to date. Have told many of my friends and they have fallen in love with it like I have 
It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game. Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock. I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it 
These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game 
I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old. Wanted to update. I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features. Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing. Otherwise it's a wonderful program. Highly recommended!! Satisfie 
I had a much earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio and really liked it. I think this new version (Deluxe 2006) is even better. This program is so easy to use and yet able to create some beautiful cards. My favorite part of the program is the Event Planner. The reminders are wonderful. I haven't missed a lecture, appointment, or any other time commitment since loading this program. I love the fact that I can set reminders for days and days ahead. Get this set for yourself and don't be afraid to get it for someone who is not too computer savvy. It should satisfy any user. 
This is a good product. My only complant is that you have to adjust the wording on almost every card to print correctly...maybe its user error...otherwise I like it 
I'm not a Spider-Man fan. I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al. So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it. I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing. And that's just what you get. In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!). And all on 1 DVD-ROM. True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run. It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller. $50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything. And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it! 
This set has got everything. Almost every major Spider-man moment is in this collection. From Spider-man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, his wedding, and not to forget those great super-villain battles with the Green Goblin and Venom. Each issue is scanned in .pdf format. It has all the original colors, ads, and fan mail printed. They are all organized by year and it says they are all printable. If you are looking for the entire Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.'s run, here it is. It is great to see where Todd Mcfarlane, the creator of Spawn got his start on old webhead. J. Michael Strackzynski, the writer of Babylon 5 also takes a crack at Spider-man's life. The collection covers the beginning from Amazing Fantasy #15 to Amazing Spiderman #531, which is around the start of Marvel's Civil War. Instead of spending thousands of dollars on purchasing back issues, you can own this entire collection for around $40-$45. If you have the ink, you can print out any issue to your heart's desire. The only drawbacks are around the 80s when several spider-man books begin to crossover. You only get a part of the story in Kraven's Last Hunt or Maximum Carnage. One major moment of Spider-man's life is left out, where he fights Harry Osborn as Green Goblin. The conclusion of that story took place in The Spectacular Spider-man title. That problem is going to fixed in the future as GIT Corp. has plans to release a complementary collection dvd that includes The Spectacular Spider-man, Web of Spiderman, and Peter Parker: Spider-man. They say on the boards that it will be out by fall of next year, but you never know with this company. I waited about six months for this dvd after it was delayed from its original release date from march. Now that I have it, I cannot wait to dig into the mythos of the old webhead. I recommend this to anyone who loves comics and loves Spider-man. Be sure to look out for the Ultimate Spider-man collection and there are a few others like the Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man, and Captain America collections that are due out next year 
I am teaching myself Japanese. I want to learn more languages. I learned German, French, and Korean. I want to learn Korean. Because I have a friend who speaks Korean. This software is very awesome!!! This can really help students who are taking French or Spanish to get a good review. If you find a language you want to learn from this software... good luck with your studies and have fun 
My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it 
This is a great collection to get if you would like to read the comic's from the past at a great price. 
I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like. However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted. This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years. Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality. If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost) 
Cool....read all the classic issues without getting french fry grease all over you collector's items 
While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd 
Came quickly, was factory sealed, loaded-up as it should. Thanks: Dale Tollefso 
I don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about, but this program is only capable of going as far as your knowledge of the tools of the program. Quite honestly, Adobe Illustrator does not have as "steep" a learning curve as most people claim. With that, I HIGHLY recommend any beginner to get the Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann. (You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training") It has to be one of the BEST most thorough book to get you introduced into the program, and for about $20, is so much BETTER than what most college "intro" computer courses offer for $200-400. Now as for Illustrator CS2, most of the newest features have left me very satisfied with the upgrade. Especially the inclusion of "Live Trace" (eliminating the former "auto-trace" tool), with it's multiple tracing modes, makes converting bitmap images to vectors SO easy. Another feature I love is the top control palette, similar to that of Photoshop, which makes accessing options much easier. The only decision you might be faced with is whether these new features are worth the price of the upgrade (that is, unless your a student) 
A great way to manage projects and share with others in your group. Not intuitive to learn, though 
One could say that this is the standard by which all other project management software is measured ... but there are no others that compare. For better or for worse, Microsoft dominates this software segment like no other. However, instead of resting on its market share, MS keeps improving its product. In more than 5 years as a professional project manager at a Fortune 500 company, I have never seen another software product in daily use other than Project ... although I'm sure they are out there somewhere. If you require others to share your files and for your project plans to be backwardly compatible years into the future, you really shouldn't consider anything else. But don't be dismayed, this is well-designed software that is surprisingly easy to learn, use and an immediate, out-of-the-box time-saver. The bottom line is still incredible value, even more so if you qualify for the low-price Academic Version, as I did while taking a continuing ed project management course 
After removing Symantec and installing Zonealarm my computer speeded up by a factor of at least 10. I'm not certain why Symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast - in my case it insisted on scanning every program transferred and used and on scanning every outgoing email even though I truned those features off. I recommend Zonealarm for users with some expertise - during the initial usage you need to understand what programs to allow and what to block (look them up on Google) 
I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better. I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with. I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos. I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean 
Having seen this product demonstrated at a recent photographic conference I purchased it as soon as I got home. When it arrived I immediately calibrated my PC monitor and Epson digital projector. The process is very simple with easy to follow screen prompts that walk you through the process. My images have been taken to a new level of color accuracy. This was the best investment I could have made to advance my photograpic color accuracy 
I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features. A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro. Installation was a snap. Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection. The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop. I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools. (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them. However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks. I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results. I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software. 
Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar) 
This software is very user friendly,easy to install, easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone 
This is a good inexpensive GPS system. It does a good job of tracking your location. The map is excellent. The labeling is not as good as the previous version. POI finder is top notch 
Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!) 
Given that this is a stripped down version of some of Sonic Foundry's more powerful (and expensive) professional tools, Acid Music 3.0 is still a pleasant surprise. I had it set up on my computer within ten minutes, and with very little tutoring from the instruction guide, was able to browse to the music loop library, "paint" out loops on the multi-track display, modify loop characteristics like reverb and bass, and so forth. Obviously, Acid Music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone. This software cannot generate its own unique loops, so I wound up having to find a MIDI program that would let me create original loops for making truly original music. But as a non-musician who hosts a radio program and is a bona fide electronic music fan, Acid Music 3.0 made it super easy to assemble my MIDI tracks into pretty good sounding pieces. I would recommend this program to anyone, musician or non-musician, interested in breaking into the world of digital computer music creation. It's been almost three months since my wife gave me my copy as a gift, and I've managed to put together many different kinds of pieces of music, using both original content and the great loops that come with the program. It's a lot of fun, and has me hungering to see what more I can do with the thing 
This product, as well as other software developed by Sonic Foundry, is used in the gaming industry. It was even used to make the music in Summoner! I've been using this product for a while, and I have made tunes like THAT and saving them as MP3s, WAVs, and so forth. Heck, if I make a digital home video or something, I can rig it with music by adding the music in with ACID Music! Get this if you want to make games with tunes, show off to friends and make them say "Damn! You couldn't have made this!", or if you got other reasons to make some good music without needing to hire an orcastra (eat your heart out, John Williams) 
That's a great product. I strongly recommend without hesitation. I had saved all of my data when my laptop was stolen. Easy to use and easy to restore data. Only I had a problem with e-mail restoration. Still I am glad I have bought this product. 
I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side. This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art. It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images... I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images... I did and I LOVE this product!!!! 
With individual images from a photo library costing about as much as this whole collection, it's great value. I'm a beginner in the design business, and was encouraged by Robin Williams' design books to acquire resources. Art Explosion is certainly a great way to go. The large collection of fonts was an unexpected bonus. Only last night my son was looking for photos of fruit for a project he's working on, and Art Explosion came up with hundreds. I'm working images into various items that I write and the huge variety means I can find something to match the other elements. I did have a problem initially with a mislabelled disk. However an email to customer support and a replacement is on the way. A better search would be nice but I'm aware of the enormous task of tagging a collection this big, with no doubt a huge increase in cost. As it is I browse it with an ordinary file browser (which I actually find easier than the inbuilt catalogues) or search with a desktop search engine. Overall it's a great product 
My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen! Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous. This software gets an A+ in my book!.  
I run the after school program at the local JR high where i work. We try to push the importance of computer skills on the children. I just upgraded to the 800,000 clip art library. We use these images for just about every project. I have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it!!! 
I was an avid reader of Nancy Drew mysteries as a girl during the 50s and now as an old girl I get to revisit Nancy in another form. I enjoyed the game, was happy not to have to deal with an alarm clock this time. Just go up the stairs in the cabin a few clicks and you have the option to make it AM or PM. I got hopelessly lost in the forest in the beginning and the night sounds were spookily effective. I will admit I did resort to an outside tip after I put the sparkplugs in the wrong way in the outboard motor. Fatal error! It made me laugh, though. Love those second chances. This is the fourth Nancy Drew game I've played and I don't plan on stopping. The games are well put together and not just for kids. I find the puzzles to be challenging and the graphics and audio very well done. Keep 'em coming herinteractive 
AutoRoute Europe, not surprisingly, is very similar to Microsoft Streets and Trips. It is easy to use, the maps are very legible, and it has many convenient features such as distance measuring and route marking (highlighting), trip planner, etc. It seems to lack some of the detail of Streets and Trips. For example, it could not find Via Martinuzzo in Reggello, Italy. I believe the street appears on the map, but is unnamed. However, this is minor. Most of what you would be looking for is available and easily found. (I had no problems finding streets in Germany, even in small towns like Wittingen.) All in all, a very good product 
Recently we are traveling a lot to London and surrounding areas on business and this map program is helping us find details quickly about areas we want to visit, travel to, and eat at. So far the only functionality that doesn't appear in AutoRoute that does in Streets and Trips that we would like to have seen is the ability to use the mouse to draw a box around and area and then enlarge it. This function is much more cumbersome in Autoroute. So far we have enjoyed this program and are making a great use of it 
Great response and great product. I have used Photoshop Elements and others but I really like this program best of the under $100 ones 
I've had several other digital editing programs and for the price, this is the best I've ever used. It's user-friendly with lots of special creative processes available. I especially love to cut and paste several pics into one by using the transparency feature to seamlessly meld them into a montage. As with any other program, practice and experimentation makes perfect! Don't be afraid to experiment on COPIES of your pics... never the originals! I do agree with the reviewer that said the red-eye needs improvement. It's just barely "OK" on most red-eyes, but is lousy correcting "glowing alien eyes!" When I bought this edition with the library feature, I wasn't sure I would use it since I had others which I thought were good. Wrong! It is fantastic! I'm sorry didn't buy it sooner. Overall, it's a 5-star product, but because of the red-eye/alien eye problem, I'm ranking it 4-stars. Even with that, I highly recommend it 
Product is terrific. Just what I was told it was. It is missing a few good tools though-such as not having the original image side by side with the image you are editing (so you can see the effect you are producing next to the original) 
I ran across an internet review of HCS 2007. The reviewer said that the rights had been sold in 2006 and that the new owners had pretty much trashed the user interface. I don't KNOW that for sure, but what I DO know is that the 2006 version is great, like that reviewer said it was. The interface is well organized, intuitive, clear, and just plain designed with common sense. I was printing a nice card in less than 3 minutes - no lie.... AND it runs ENTIRELY on your hard drive - no CD required. That alone easily recommends it 
I was really impressed with this version of Hallmark Card Studio. It is really easy to use, and they have alot of cards to choose from. It is one of the best programs I have used. I would recommend it to anyone. 
Works great. Like printing options. Would like to be able to change graphics beyond clip art 
I found this product easy to install in my computer and was able to put it to use within an hour. This was very helpful since I had a project I wanted to use this to do and it arrived in time for installation and use to be within my deadline 
Premiere Elements has almost the same features than its "big brother" Adobe Premiere but the price is much more affordable. It is an excellent tool for amateurs and yet professionals. Regards 
I bought Premiere after I discovered that the software that came with my new DVD Palmcorder didn't let me edit on my PC. Somewhere I ascertained that Premiere did permit this, and indeed it does. I found it very easy to use, so much so that I was able to get my first two "productions" up on YouTube in a matter of perhaps two hours. Obviously I have not learned everything this product has to offer, nor do I use very well what I have already discovered, but it was easy to get results that, for a rank beginner, actually look sort of polished. This product would get five stars from me if it accepted DVD-RAM from my Palmcorder. It does not, and I nearly gave the product five stars anyway because my inquiry to their customer service people produced a very helpful and completely candid response that was clearly personalized for me. In other words, the quality of the customer support almost erased a small deficiency in the product. Overall, this is a really good product 
4000 fonts? well, counting both truetype and postscript versions, so really 2000, then take out the extended, condensed, outline, and other versions of the same fonts and you are left with about 800 different fonts, now that includes an oblique version of almost every font, which I leave in because it's a little difficult to make them on the fly. Many of them have regular, bold, bold oblique, oblique families, and THE VARIANTS ARE NAMED RIGHT, so they are easy to weed out. The fonts themselves are smooth where they should be, and appear well constructed. I cannot speak about the font manager software because I'm on a Macintosh, and so cannot run it, but the fonts are well worth the money 
Tried to install with previous Norton Systemworks and Norton Internest Security on system. Had all kinds of problems. Microsoft add/remove software method would leave tidbits of programs and foul up install. Finally went to Symantec site and found Norton Removal tool which completely removed all Norton programs. Install went smoothly then and Systemworks Premier is working quite well. (Had same problem installing 2007 Internet Security and installed it first, then found that you have to remove Internet Sec. before installing Systemworks!! Removed IS, installed Systemworks and then reinstalled IS, now all Norton programs working well. 
We have owned 14 PC's and now a MAC. In the last 10 years, we have never had a problem with Norton products. I recommend them to anyone who wants ease of use and excellent customer service. Some of the problems people in these reviews are complaining about things that either can be easily fixed or has something to do with their conflict of another program. Obviously, you do not run two simultaneous virus programs. Unistall any other previous versions of any Anti-Virus programs. Then install your new one. The bottom line, before you read hothead reviews, do a little research. I am a 10 year user of Norton with no problems. [...] 
I, too, used to complain about Norton's poor customer service and the awful inability to smoothly upgrade. That was until I tried two other major products at home and changed employers to one with another major Norton competitor (products included McAfee's AntiVirus, ComputerAssociates' eTrust, and a couple of well-rated free-ware packages). The bottom line is protection without getting in the way. According to numerous reviews, Norton provides excellent protection. In addition, it has the ability to exclude known safe directories and it stops protecting almost immediately when you realize that it's spending a lot of CPU cycles scanning a known good file and you ask it to stop -- for example, the eTrust menu allows you to tell it to stop, but it doesn't take effect until the next transaction, which is too late to speed up a lengthy, trustworthy transaction. Norton is easy and intuitive to configure, even in its significantly more complex Internet Security package. All of the products I've tried, including major ones, fail in one or all of these key attributes. Therefore, I'll put up with Norton's awful renewal process and weak customer service in order to have a product that does what it's designed to do and that is flexible enough to be reasonable about it. Since recent reviews reveal that no single product provides good coverage against spyware, I do supplement Norton's product with periodic scans for spyware using "AdAware" and "Pest Patrol", and I keep "Startup Inspector" installed and on guard 
I always use norton antivirus products and have never had a computer problem in 14 year 
I'm an interior designer and have Interior Designer 7.0. It's easy to learn, but I already had used similar programs and I know CAD, but you don't need any cad experience to use this program. Materials render well, but the library of furniture and accessories is fairly limited. For example I was creating a game room for a client and only had one style of pool table to choose from and no accessory items such as pool sticks, balls or wall racks. I've figured out some workarounds such as using round millwork items and sinking them into the pool table to look like balls. Bed styles are also very limited. I've downloaded all their bonus furniture, but it's still lacking. The fabric options are also fairly limited, but be sure to scroll down past "fabric" to find the category "BH Fabric". For colors, scroll down past "colors" to Benjamin Moore or download the bonus Sherwin Williams colors. Also the best plants are in the "Xfrog" category. To save time set your render quality to low for fast renderings, then change it back to high to place your accessories. The program does a good job allowing you to import your own images and textures. To show an image on a TV screen, define it as a new texture in your custom library with width set to 0 (so it doesn't repeat the image). Overall I like the program I just need to figure out how to get more furniture and accessories 
I used this application to design an addition to our house. It was very easy to use;it has an extensive library of furniture, window styles, flooring, etc. You can change the dimensions of whats in the library as well as colors, finishes, materials. It made it possible to view what the room would look like with our existing furniture and helped determine what size the room would have to be. I took my laptop and printouts to the architect and builder, and the room looks great! 
Running Norton 2006 it took almost 30 seconds to open an Excel Worksheet on my 2002 Dell with 256 MB Ram runing Windows XP. I uninstalled Norton and installed Kaspersky. It now takes 3 seconds to open the same file!! It did take longer to initially scan my machine, so what? I can do it at 3 AM. The machine runs faster. The one feature that I have not yet gotten to work is where already scanned and unchanged files are not rescanned. That would reduce the scan time to minutes. Allowing me to scan the machine every day if I wanted to. 
This is one of the better photo editing programs I have used. It is very simple and easy to use, yet very powerful. Most programs such as photoshop, and even elements are very hard to use. Although this isnt quite as powerful, it makes up for being so easy to use. Its nice and cheap 2, what could be better 
This is a great product for anyone wanting to correct or enhance their photos and it doesn't require any experience in photography. I used it to enlarge, enhance and correct pictures I had taken at a concert and I was completely surprised and very pleased with the end result. 
I recently purchased Omnipage 15 as I had some old articles I wanted to edit and archive. I had been told that Omnipage would do the job. It did not disappoint. It was fast, kept the format, and as a bonus had made the PDFs it created searchable. I got through my original project so quickly; I have been using it on other documents. It has done a great job. Even the ones that are poor quality have come out great. I highly recommend this program. It has been well worth the money 
I took the plunge and downloaded Apple's Boot Camp for the Intel based Macintosh. I had some old PC games so I thought this was worth giving a try. Apple's setup process was seamless for partioning a seperate drive I installed just for Windows XP. Then you get to the Windoze part of installation with the famous blue screen. It does look antiquated, but I followed Boot Camp's instructions to install. Windows XP took about 90 minutes via the "standard" insall method. Apple's OS X as I remember installed in about 10-20 minutes! Since my installation about four months ago, Windows XP has been running just fine. I have actually gone onto getting additional PC games of my Windows XP disk. So this is great for those who want to have a Mac OS X side for work and a Windows XP side for play. Plus it looks like there won't be many games available in the future for OS X. Apple's latest version of Boot Camp includes Windows Vista support, however I think I will hold off given the written reviews here on Vista. Windows XP does just fine for gaming 
I've owned the past 4 versions of Toast, and each has been a marked improvement. I use this to copy dubs for advertising, and it meets exceeds my needs! Thanks for a great product- Johnn 
Have used PE 2.0 in the past. Recently decided to rejoin the digital editing age. Chose this product after reviewing many products including Lightroom, Aperture, Capture, Photoshop Cs and decided this offered the simplest methods for home editing. Also purchsed Classroom in a Book from Adobe and am tutoring myself. So far, so happy 
I bought this Photoshop Elements software to help boost my digital scrap booking hobby. Unfortunately, it is a bit over my head. Perhaps if you are already familiar with Adobe Photoshop, then this software would be a cinch. But, for me, it isn't. I have spent more time trying to figure out how to use the Elements software versus having actually used it. If you are trying digital scrap booking for the first time, I recommend buying Scrapbook Factory Delux 3.0 version for less than 1/2 the cost of Photoshop Elements 
This is my 3rd year doing my taxes with TurboTax. I encountered some bugs with non-material stuff, but I didn't go and hand-check the entire return so I don't know if there would have been any material bugs that would actually affect the dollar amounts. The bugs that I encountered were the following: - When asking me for changes to my address which it imported from last year's return, it didn't provide phone numbers. One of those phone numbers had changed. Later, when doing the state taxes, it asked which phone number I wanted to use. At that time, it provided a choice of the old phone number but didn't allow me to update it. - It seemed to import all the information from my financial institution OK and it reported the dollar amounts of the net proceeds and cost basis correctly. However, on the worksheet, even though the description said it was a sale of 50 shares, the quantity field said one share. Little bugs like these make me wonder if all the math being done underneath is OK. I'm also worried that if you run the program in a different order, the results might be different. But who knows? With a cursory check things looked OK. One thing that I was bummed about was that when entering the buys corresponding to a stock sale it allowed me to enter things in reverse chronological order (and in fact didn't prompt me otherwise) and yet at the end of the program when doing audit checks, it wanted me to reenter the data in chronological order. I didn't bother since it only affected a worksheet. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there are no material errors! Unfortunately, it looks like other tax products also have these kinds of weird bugs 
The box was not factory sealed, but the product works fine none the less 
I am a nurse who works a lot of overtime and has several income properties to supplement my income. I don't have a lot of time because I work a lot of overtime. Turbo Tax Primier made getting my entire withholding for both state and federal refunded to me far easier than if I'd taken all that paperwork to an accountant for the same task. The cost was a fraction of what the accountant would have charged, too. My returns are very complicated, but doing them with Turbo Tax Primier was definitely not. I've used it for 3 years and am extrememly happy with it 
I've actually downgraded from Final Cut HD because when I bought that software it didn't work with my computer and then Apple couldn't fix so I was out $300. I needed to buy another software package but didn't want to spend another $300 so I went with FC Express. Because I'm a student it only cost me $99. To tell you the truth it's not that much different than the full version of FC. Most people that use FC are doing features which I'm not doing, and other people use it for the title generator and sound editing. I have other softwares for that. If you are looking into upgrading from iMovie and want FC go with FC Express. It's cheaper and there is not much difference in the two. If you are taking a video course at a college or other schools, check out the student discount price, it's great. 
Final Cut Express HD is awesome. But don't try to learn how to use FCE on your own - buy a book such as Final Cut Express for Dummies and spend some time working through the concepts. I had previously used Adobe Premiere, so making the switch to FCE was not quite the hurdle that is going to be for others. If you make the jump from iMovie, do realize you will need to spend a lot of time learning how to use FCE. If you are going to edit simple home movies, probably stick with iMovie. iMovie is quick and simple. But for professional results, definitely use FCE. But do realize there is a fairly steep learning curve. Once mastered, editing in FCE is quick. I use FCE for professional quality editing work when I need to edit down multiple cameras shooting simultaneously (a feature that Final Cut Pro now makes automatic, but not FCE), and complex editing involving numerous audio and video tracks. I routinely re-arrange my audio from one clip and overlay over another. I also routinely adjust audio levels and mix multiple audio tracks. While FCE HD comes with the Soundtrack application, most of my audio editing is done with the FCE audio tools directly. LiveType is a titling application that also is bundled with FCE HD and enables the creation of broadcast quality titling and titling effects. LiveType is worth the price of FCE HD alone! FCE also includes a huge assortment of both audio and video filters to adjust or clean up original content, or color filters to match the colors between multiple cameras. Except for simple home movies, where I still sometimes use iMovie, I use FCE HD for everything else. I could not produce the type of material that I create without FCE HD. I strongly recommend FCE for anyone wishing to produce professional quality video results, especially those who need to synchronize and mix multiple video and audio tracks and/or use advanced titling features of LiveType. Like most video applications, more RAM is better. FCE sort of runs on my 640 MB RAM Powerbook G4. But it files on the my dual 867 Mhz G4 with 2 GB of RAM (but 1 GB would be plenty). If you are going to be doing video editing, a GB of RAM will be very desirable 
If you've only worked with iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, you may be intimidated at first, but the end results speak for themselves. It is true that Final Cut Express HD isn't necessarily intuitive and the options are innumerable, but you will emerge from the other side of the learning curve amazed at how polished your works have become. You can update old iMovie projects easily; just import them into Express HD and add high quality titles and credits and an attractive soundtrack. If you want to take it further, you can experiment with an astounding variety of professional quality transitions, filters, and effects to deliver the full visual and auditory impact you desire. If you already have a previous release of Final Cut Express, the inclusion of LiveType and Soundtrack alone justify this upgrade. For a bonus, GarageBand musicians will love the hundreds of Apple loops included in the Soundtrack package 
This product has some of the best protection for on-line transactions. The product was able to view and secure my bank portal and allowed me to conduct my on-line transactions in a secure form. I am very happy to see that Symantec has moved into this space and providing added security to people like myself that do lots of pruchase on the internet. This is truly a revolutionary product for the consumer. 
I really don't know where is these people coming from saying the product do not work. I installed the product in just a couple of minutes and let me tell you I was just amazed !! It delivered on its promised and is giving me all the information I need on possible phishing pharming attacks, also the password feature is awesome Dann 
This program is a joy to use,the options for formating and editing are endless ,works very good on my old computer with Windows 2000 system. Prints very nice cards. The address labels are professional also does good job on envelopes and gift tags etc 
WordPerfect is a wonderful word processor. I have used both Word and WordPerfect. It is much more intuitive than Word. The reveal code feature is worth its weight in gold. Unlike Word, user has complete control over all aspects of their document. Quattro Pro and Presentations are equally capable in office environment. Since it allows saving in MS Office formats it is very handy 
First, after reading the reviews below, I noticed that only one person(Merrifield Winters) doesn't like this suite. Upon noticing that he is from Seattle(Microsoft's hometown), I decided to look at his other reviews. According to Mr. Winters, he purchases and extensively uses each version of WordPerfect Office, even after saying that each one is worthless. He also seems to have glowing complements for Microsoft products. This tends to make me think that Mr. Winters is a paid or voluntary basher. In my experience as a CPA, I have used both WordPerfect and MS Office on a day-to-day basis, both word processing and spreadsheets, and I have found that WordPerfect makes a product with many innovations that are then copied a year later by Microsoft Office. I guess they save a lot on R D this way. Also, WP is much more intuitive for new users. I have had some clients that start on MS Office, only to give up due to its complexity and lack of explanations. I suggested WP to them, and they found that it was easy to follow. The only time that I will use MS Office is when I am supervising a client at their office, while I am complaining about it. 
I would give this product a 5 star rating but it just came out and there are a few very small problems. I'm sure Microsoft will fix them in future updates. One problem: when trying to insert an image it freezes when going to the directory which holds the image, you can back out and continue without any problems. A work around is to drag and drop the image. I miss some of the features FrontPage has, like, photo gallery web components(counter, marquee etc.) But, you can cut and paste code from FrontPage to Expression web and they will work. So, don't get rid of the FrontPage 2003 you can us some of its features with Expression Web. Expression web is a world class product many more features than FrontPage (CSS, ASP.NET,XHTML etc). If you are a web designer like me you will see what I mean when you use this product. Not mentioned in the advertising Expression Web comes with a second DVD with several hours of instructional movies on applications using this product. 
I've had NAV 2007 3 user for about 4 months now. No problems. I think the key is being aware of these comments and being careful to uninstall any previous versions of NAV before installing. It is also generally true when installing many types of security software that you have to be careful about running security software from other companies (like a firewall from ZoneAlarm, etc) with that software. I don't use any other, including a firewall, since I'm careful about my outgoing activity/programs I install and my router protects me from uninitiated incoming activity. I think a good antivirus program coupled with some good incoming firewall protection (hardware(NAT router) or software, preferably hardware) and common sense and caution on the user's part about what they download, install, and websites they go to, etc is all that's really needed for most people. A bunch of extra garbage usually only complicates your life in time, money, etc spent on your part usually without a great deal of added protection (this includes user propensities as well... like getting sick of your software firewall nagging you all the time and so not looking at alerts as critically anymore, etc). A bunch of concurrently running security software also tends to bog your system down and increase the risk of a system crash 
I got the order really fast within 10 days. Word of advice is to make sure you have your other virus and spam blockers turned off or disabled so that you can install this new stuff 
I have used this software for many years and has worked flawlessly 
This is working out pretty well overall. Our business has been using it for 1 year now, and we have to look back and say it was great, helped us in many ways. Of course there are a few annoying things (we like to write long estimate proposals and it only allows line by line entries-it assumes you are selling items!). On the positive side we love that it backs up to .mac service every time you quit program, and it has never crashed, very robust. This was an easy and natural progression from Quicken 
This has really helped my company in increasing effeciency. It is pretty easy to use 
I originally bought a CD-DVD-RW drive that shipped with the O.E.M version of Nero 7. Every so often it would "freeze-up" and I would have to reboot the computer. Since I bought the full blown edition of Nero 7 there has been no "freeze-ups". What I really liked about this edition is it comes with about 20 programs and you have the option to install which ones you feel you may need 
Before I bought this product I noted with interest the negative reviews. For the record I don't work for Nero, and never have. I am s software programmer and small network admin who has a pretty fair knowledge of how software things work. I tried out the downloadable trial and then bought this product after using the trial for a few days. The download installs just fine in both WinXP SP2 and Vista RTM. Product seems fine to me. I guess others have had their bad experiences; I certainly don't know why. Oh, the reason I installed the downloaded version was that the package product notes suggested I do so for Windows Vista. I used the key with my retail package and then the product went from demo to full. I am pleased with what I have 
As a user of Norton/Symantec products for the last 10 years it was difficult to make the change, but I finally got fed up with the unintuitive bloated Norton resource hog and made the switch to the Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Security Suite. So far, I am very pleased with my purchase. I feel like I am back in charge of my firewall, and my PC is running more nimbly these days with 5 fewer processes running in the background. There is very little I can add to the excellent review by Amazon user Matthew Morgan as I agree in general with his assessment of the ZSS strengths and weaknesses. I bought it primarily as a firewall and anti-virus solution, and this is where the real strengths of the product lie. The firewall is very customizible, yet can be simplified enough that my un-tech wife can administer it when the need arises. I especially have confidence in the virus scanner after it picked up a trojan on its first scan that Norton had missed weekly for months. Sure ad and pop up blocking could be better but I use Firefox with its integrated pop up blocker, and coupled with Firefox's excellent and free Adblock extension I don't need any help in this area. Similarly I already rely on the integrated spam blocking in Firefox's companion email client Thunderbird, so any ZSS weaknesses in this area are not an issue for me either. If you are serious about stopping popups and blocking ads start by ditching Internet Explorer and Outlook/Express, then you will have less of a need for these kinds of features yourself. Lastly, I would like to respond to another reviewer's recommendation of using a router firewall in place of this kind of client based software firewall. You absolutely should use a router with a firewall enabled, but that is only half the battle as it will only give you inbound protection from port-scanning script kiddies. A router NAT firewall does NOTHING to protect you from Trojans you invite onto your machine via emails and downloaded files you execute, nor will it stop these Trojans from masquarading as legit programs with unlimited outbound access. So yes, use your router firewall, but ALWAYS in conjuction with a good software based firewall on all your clients. A good software based firewall like Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Security Suite 
Windows Firewall does not block outgoing connections. Check this using leaktest at www.grc.com. "Just so you know, WinXP's built-in firewall does not attempt to manage or restrict outbound connections at all. It appears to be a useful firewall for hiding the machine from the Internet (it has "stealth mode" unsolicited packet handling), but you will still need to use a good third-party personal firewall if you wish to manage and control outbound connections from your system." Quoted from the GRC website. I tested it myself. Zonealarm did block this whereas XP did not. This means that when my wife clicked on an IM virus, it was blocked by Zonealarm instead of sending out copies to all of her friends and email acquintances. With only XP, the virus would have spread 
I have not had the chance to use the item as much as I would like, but have been very satisfied with what I have seen. I was a French minor in college and have participated in numerous ways to learn and maintain the language. The interactive technique and exercises appear to be far more effective than those I have experienced in the past. I am pleased with the product, overall 
While not easy, this is a very good product for learning the French language. There is a variety of learning tasks that reinforces the learning experience. Although most of the learning options were useful, I found typing responses in French to be too awkward and time consuming to use without a French keyboard. The visual pictures would be more effective if images from France or the French speaking countries had been used. 
I have been a huge champion of WordPerfect since it was written by Satellite Software Inc (SSI) about 200 years ago. I was forced into MS Word and it is not as good, but you get used to it. One caution, WP X3 does not handle PDFs at any useful level. Even simple PDFs had so many formatting problems, it was faster to re-create them by hand (which is not a fast thing). 
Am longtime user of Microsoft Office. I admit it was frustrating at first to use this new system, but have been delighted overall. Really cool new features (or least now accessible to me): Outlook as nice feature of a to-do bar with just the next few appointments coming up to right of monthly calendar view. To do file management like delete/rename in Word open menu, (as opposed to going to to file manager), the real time resizing and recoloring of text as mouse passes thru the color and dropdown menus (as oposed to choosing, see if it works, go back to the size menu, choose, see if it works etc.). Their rational in going to the ribbons was that too many features were never discovered for use, and I do feel that as a power user my power is enhanced as I go through the ribbions by clicking on tabs at the top. Bottom line, for someone really into the esthetics of software and who is patient, this upgrade is probably for you. Otherwise the previous version will do nicely. P.S. If you've not download the free Microsoft Desktop search program, run to rather than walk to is my recomendation. James Warner, Seattl 
Being a fan of Microsoft products, this is one of the more advanced upgrades ever. You just have to stay up with the times 
I bought this for my dad as an upgrade, since he used the old version of Quickbooks (2002) and his tax guy bailed on him and never returned to upgrade. So, my father had 2 computers, one that was a dinosaur (6 years old!)and one that he just bought 2 years ago (top of the line at the time). He never got around to installing a version of quickbooks to his new pc so he always used his old one. I got fed up with him and his poor excuse for a number-crunching machine and bought this product for him. I backed up his old quickbooks company file to a few floppy disks, installed the 2006 version on his new computer, and the update was a snap. All I had to do was go through a few menus on 2006 and it asked for the floppies. I threw them in one by one, and it not only transferred ALL of his company information and ALL of his thousands of customer invoices and estimates to the new computer, it also updated to files to 2006 all in one "swing of the bat". E Z install, E Z company data transfer, all of this was installed and transferred within an hour (would have went faster if his old PC didn't take 10 minutes to boot up)! And to think, that was my first time dealing with Quickbooks. Not to meantion, I found it easier to navigate through the menus in comparing to 2002. A significant improvement over 2002, undoubtedly 
My girl has always loved Mia and she loves knowing words in other languages, so Mia's Language adventure in a real winner in our home. I sat with her through parts of the game and was amazed at the depth of the educative activities. The story was fun and I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in second languages. Bravo 
I've been using Norton products for over 10 years. Each year they get more complex and more bulky. However, once the product is configured properly it tends to run well, detects intrusions and can improve the health of just about any Windows based system. The online update process seems to work well. However if you change your hardware system configuration you may have to re-activate the product. The default (out-of-box) settings ALWAYS needs tweaking. The 2007 version is even more bloated than this version. 
Well let me tell ya..... I`ve use this Same Norton System Works now for 4 Years , By Buying a Renewal Disk each year . I use this system Because it works 24/7 and has "Never" Failed me one time . It WILL Keep your system safe and the IDIOT Hacker A-holes outa your Computer 100% ! It keeps your E-mail 100% Virus Free Automatic !..... It has some Very Neet Tool`s to keep your system running smooth as a babys butt , and You can set it up to do all of the diff. tools on Automatic if you want or on Manuel . Your Option .... I like that. PS: .... I like all of the Norton Anti Virus System they have out , But This System is the "BEST" System I like . 
I ordered this product as a result of a recommendation from a nationally known artist, who uses this software to assist her in composing ideas for her paintings. One of the features I most appreciate is the ability to straighten out pictures that were taken at an odd angle. The software is very easy to use and intuitive. I would recommend it 
I have been using Paint Shop Pro for many years the last was version 7. This new version is, from so far limited use, very much easier to use for editing photos and produces pleasing results. I have not used the graphics on this version but expect that it will as usual be an easy interface. 
I bought this for my wife and she thinks it is grea 
My boys gave me this set for christmas and i love it. Igrew up with these comics and this is a great way to reread and share them with my boys. Bring us more of the, PLEASE!!!! 
OK, so I got some old comics but I never found number 79. I always wondered what happened in that one. I read 78 and 80 many years ago, but there was always holes in the story. Now I can find out exactly what happened without paying a small forture for a collectors item. I will never be able to afford all the different comics and bound reprint collections to own all of the "FF." Now for a relatively small amount of money, compared to the cost of every comic at it's original cover price, I own every individual comic and then some. Wow, unique. This is kind of different. It works as promised, so I can read any story I want. A story I own that is packed away in one of several boxes from my youth, or a new one that came out when comics were the last thing on my mind. I won't buy many of these collections. But having one presents the possibility to go through one title and see its history. Few people had this option until this product came out. Give it try. See what you think. It will take a lot longer to go through than a TV series that costs the same. 
Since I can remember, the Fantastic Four has always been my favorite comic book. It was not just that the characters were interesting and had their own issues, but it was also that they were human as well as superheroes. The appeal of Ben Grimm, the sweetness of Sue Storm, brash Johnny Storm and the ultra-scientific (and never quite dorky) Reed Richards were a perfect team because they grew together and drew you into their lives. But let's not forget that the FF also brought many novel comic aspects: The Watcher, the Negative Zone, the Inhumans, and of course, Galactus and the Silver Surfer. Growing up with the FF I consider the "Golden Era" of this comic book to be the years in which Stan Lee and Jack Kirby worked on them (up to issue 100 or so). In particular, the issues between the introduction of the Black Panther (one of my all-time favorite stories) to the introduction of Him (Warlock) were particularly interesting. In this 2 year time frame, Dr. Doom stole the Silver Surfer's powers, the Kree resurfaced, Blastaar made his presence known while Reed was in danger in the Negative Zone. All wonderful stories, and Jack Kirby's artwork was at its peak. You can see all of this for yourself in this collection and more. You can read Stan's most eloquent prose and admire Jack's creative capabilities as one of the great comic book artists. You will also be able to see the ebb and flow of stories, how different writers took the FF in other directions, how the comic book floundered and how it was reborn. Indeed, due to its longevity, the FF are not just the indomitable team of 4 superheroes, but the collective effort of great artists and writers that brought these creations to life in the pages of a medium not considered artistic by many. The collection contained in the DVD is all in Acrobat format and are scanned images of real comic books. Thus, you will see yellowing pages, smudges, tears, etc. For me, this is a good thing, because it shows the comics as collector items. (I don't think making an antique look new is a good thing. If an antique is well-preserved, that is OK, but it still has to be an antique.) On the whole, I am very satisfied with this purchase and for a few dollars took a stroll down memory lane in the convenience of my computer or laptop. I still have my own collection, including those captured in Marvel Collectors Item Classics (the first reprints of FF comics that later became Marvel Greatest Comics), but the collection in this set is unsurpassed and well worth every penny 
44 years of the fantastic four, for 40 bucks. incredible. it's easy to manipulate the comics with the reader, and they are extremely easy to see. a subscription (which is still a great deal) to ff now through marvel costs about 23 bucks a year, but here you can get 44 years of the greatest team in comics for less than the cost of 2 years worth of subscriptions. amazing. imagine how much it'd cost if you just collected trades of the great lee/kirby or byrne storylines. but instead you can get 44 years plus annuals just for 40 bucks. crazy. fantastic. this is probably the single greatest ff collectible out there, outside of owning the original comics. 
Just as promised, Stan Lee has reproduced the entire Fantastic Four collection published for the last 44 years. Theres no way I have been able to read all of the issues, but it is really easy to pick out the issues I wanted. Some of the comics scanned could have been in a little better condition, but at this late date most of those are sealed and graded by CGC. It would be nice to have a search engine to help find issues with particular characters as well. Overall, though, it is great to have all 500+ issues on one disk for a reasonable price. 
If you want to get the digital photos out of your camera and out in email, this is a good place to start. Snapfire puts the basic functions where you can find them and makes them relatively easy to understand. It helps if you understand pixel dimensions, but it isn't required. The first thing you need to do is to see how big your photo will be when displayed on the computer screen of the email recipient. Simply open the photo and click on "zoom to 100%." That's the true size. If you drag your photo into the Photo Tray (see more below on dragging restrictions), you can also see the photo dimensions and the file size by placing your cursor over the photo thumbnail. If the photo is too big and you want to resize it, you can do so from the Edit menu ("Resize") by setting new pixel dimensions (e.g. 800x600) or by setting the new size as a percentage of the original. Then view the resulting photo size by using "zoom to 100%". When it's the right size, save it. Crop is also easy. You can crop to any shape you want, or to standard proportions (e.g. 4x6). Again, "zoom to 100%" to see the results. That's pretty much all it takes to get a photo ready for email. My only complaint is that when you have resized a photo and it is still in your editing window, you can't see its current properties (dimensions and file size) without saving it. (When you save it, it is placed in the Photo Tray, and you can put your cursor over it to see the details.) Snapfire has standard photo enhancement options such as red-eye correction, "quick fix," adjustments to brightness and warmth, and also a "makeover" option which can be used to whiten teeth and remove blemishes. You can also, of course, rotate photos. And you can insert text and add picture frames. The same options are available in other software, but I like the fact that this product is not so overloaded with options that it is difficult to use. I would find it relatively easy to guide someone through the processes even if they were inexperienced. And it still has all the features I would need. I haven't used the Download software, but it appears to put the photos into My Pictures, the standard location. When you go to the Snapfire Home page, you first highlight the folder you want to work with using "Find Files" in the left pane. The individual photos in that folder will appear on the right in the main editing screen. From there you can select one photo to edit, or drag multiple photos into the Photo Tray at the bottom for easier access. If you put your cursor over a photo in the Photo Tray you can see its dimensions and size. One option that I personally like is the ability to unlock the aspect ratio when resizing a photo. If you ever capture photos from a video source, you sometimes may find the photos to be distorted. For example, people may look fat. Unlocking the aspect ratio allows you to fix the photos. A warning: I tried sending a Slide Show to a friend and they were unable to open it without obtaining Snapfire software. I felt that I was sending Snapfire advertising, so won't be using this feature. 
I have evaluated only the free version of Snapfire, which is pretty polished and seems to work ok for me (I didn't run into bugs), but runs pretty slow on my laptop. I find Picasa 2 and Adobe Photoshop Album to be more full featured. Both run better on my PC, and are easy to use. Picasa 2 is free, and I'm leaning that way. PC Magazine has a good set of reviews of these software packages, so that's a good place to look to learn more. 
I'm an advanced amateur photographer who takes photos mainly for my own pleasure but I've also sold some prints and I also do some paid assignments. Anyway, trying to calibrate my monitor to achieve accurate color has been a difficult, seemingly impossible, sometimes almost futile endeavor. I've used manual (eyeballing) software tools such as Adobe Gamma without any success. Adobe Gamma got me whole lot closer to my ideal of a perfect color match than my factory default unadjusted monitor, but it was still off... the colors were a little too warm and the gamma a bit too high. Then I decided to order a hardware calibration tool. Enter the Spyder2Express. This thing is amazing! It was very easy to install and set up. About 10 minutes later my monitor was perfectly calibrated! Now my prints match what I see on the screen with amazing precision. I should have ordered one of these things a while ago... it would have saved me tons of headache and wasted prints 
Pros: Good, well contructed, colorimeter for the novice, easy to use software walks you through every step. I notice a definite improvement in my new 22" WS LCD's picture. I had tried Adobe Gamma and Quick Gamma, but these programs rely on your eyes for making brightness and contrast corrections, and setting gamma. My eyes are not as sharp as they were 20 years ago. Cons: The new updated software, version 2.3, has been out since June, 2006 but Colorvision is still shipping with the older version. Go to their website [...]), download 2.3 (110.3 MB), install it, and use the keycode on your 2.2 version to run it. The 2.3 version changes the target white point for LCDs to 6500K instead of Native. I personally prefer 6500k anyway. Gamma 2.2 and 6500K are the only choices with the Express. If you want more choices you will have to purchase the more expensive Pro version. After calibration and exiting the software I got a "Can not find color profile" error message. Rebooting solved this. With the counter-weight adjusted, I still had to tilt my LCD monitor back 15 - 20 degrees before I could get the Spyder to lay completely flat on the screen. 
I tried to live without monitor calibration for a long time, but my prints were always so disappointing that I broke down bought this one. I found it very easy to use, and my prints match beautifully now. Definitely worth the expense 
I was getting stressed out on how behind I was on scrapbooking- so I researched scrapbooking software. Ulead's Scrapbook 2 program was rated as an affordable, but good option, so I bought a copy on ebay for 21 cents. No big investment, just wanted to try it. It was a more stripped down version of the program, with 350 clip art items, and 100 pre-made pages, instead of the regular hundreds or thousands (I'm not sure), but that was fine, because I paid 21 cents, right? It was, in my opinion, hard to use, but I did like the possibilities of digital scrapbooking. So I went on the recommendation of another Amazon reviewer, and bought the Broderbund program. LOVE IT!!!! I've kicked out 10 or so pages tonight that look better than ANYTHING I've tried to make with paper and scissors. If you can use Printshop or Printmaster, you can easily master this program in a matter of minutes. Tons of scrapbook templates, tons of cute paper, tons of impressive effects. (I like the "torn" look around the photos, I always loved the look, but could never actually tear the paper to make the effect look halfway decent!) A very affordable, great program. Get it and get caught up! Let go of the guilt and burnout!!! You're still a woman, even if you can't cut paper:) Don't let your first kid have a huge scrapbook, your middle kid have a medium sized scrapbook, and your last kid have a box of unlabeled photographs....LO 
I got this set from my kids for Christmas and love it. I wish they had added the Giant-sized issues in with them but this is a great way to look at these old books and let your kids enjoy them also 
I have a Mac at home and the DVD Rom had difficulties with my Mac. I'm on OSX and when I tried to read the PDF file, there was a transparent MARVEL logo across the center of every page that was annoying. When I tried to move onto the next issue, it would be missing and I would have to reload and start the disc again. When I took it to work and put it in my PC at my desk, it worked great, no transparency and a better presentation of menus for usage overall, so I guess I'll be reading this at work when I have time.. 
This is a great chess game. It comes with an animated tutorial and various games that teach young children how to move the chess pieces and also discusses beginning chess strategy. This is my second copy of the game the first one got scratch and I could no longer use it. In fact, the only bad thing I would say about the game is that it doesn't completely install on your computer. In order to play the game you have to insert the disc in your computer 
Registry Mechanic was very easy to use and found over 800 errors in my registry. It cleaned them up automatically, without causing any problems. My system runs faster and boots up quicker. I was reluctant to try fooling with the registry, but I'm glad I did. 
This DV editing software is one of the best in the industry. While if you one version 1.x or 2.x who really are missing out on this new version. If you do NOT run OS X you should think twice about buying this product. However OSX users should definatly buy it because it adds native support. Also if you do not own a G4 also don't consider it because it is truley optimized for the G4 and will not preform well on a G3 
I use this clip-art at work. The selection of art is great. We have several other clip-art collections but I mostly use this one because it is so simple to search for what you need. Some of the photographs that I have wanted to use for backgrounds have been too small to convert to 300 dpi, though. But other than that, I really like this clip-art. 
Have been using Turbo Tax for the past 7 or 8 years. When Quicken, in their wisdom, decided to no longer support WIN98 I thought I'd give Taxcut a try. Worked great with simple interview process.I think I'll just stick with them now due to their thoughtfulness. Even when I upgrade to doing my taxes on upgraded computer 
I have used Tax Cut over the past few years, for my federal returns. Tax Cut does the job, and was relatively easy to use. I do not use the state programs as I can file on-line for my state, which is simpler and faster than using the option provided by Tax Cut. I think the high on-line filing fee ($15) is a bit much, since the process probably costs about 2 cents to execute, and a stamp and envelope is not much more costly. That said, filing method is a personal preference. Having to download a state return is pain in the rump for someone without a high speed internet connection, though it probably makes business sense for H to structure the process this way 
This is the NLT Life App Study Bible in Camel/Camel Leatherlike. First of all, the colour of this Bible is fantastic---actual eye candy for me, so out of all the other Life App Bibles, this one drew me. I like these colourful Leatherlike editions, and they were made in South Korea, which means that the bindings are sewn, and will last. The ribbon-marker is a decent length. The translation is very, very well done, and professional. Now, remember, this is not a 'literal', or 'Formal Equivalent' translation. It is 'Dynamic Equivalence' or, it translates the thoughts of the Biblical writers. With that in mind, the New Living Translation is a re-do of Ken Taylor's Living Bible Paraphrased, which, in my mind, was the most exciting and riveting Bible there was. The NLT is much tighter, and can be used for study. The notes are superb, as well as the character studies, which inform very well about different Biblical personages. The only thing I do not like about this Bible is the red-letter text in the New Testament. It almost makes the red-letter verses seem more important than the others, which is not good. On a practical basis, it is very glaring. I wish Bible publishers would publish just the black-letter text. This Bible is also not a lightweight. It's a good 2400 pages. But, all in all, this is indeed an edition to have. And the NLT is a great, great read. No seventeenth-century English to have to translate. And the colour on this one is a knockout 
I love this Bible. I love the Lord but struggled with reading his word. I prayed about it...now with this Bible and by reading out loud (so I don't daydream) I have finally found a way to enjoy and understand God's word for me 
Having used Vista off and on since the release of the first public beta, I had already become familiar with the interface by the time the final version came out. Menu and computer browsing are different from XP, but no less functional. I think the biggest complaints I have heard seem to be based solely on resistance to change. Change is not a bad thing, and in many cases the web browsing interface makes things much more intuitive for me. Many of the flashy effects are fun to play with for a day or two, but most have now been turned off to divert resources to productivity. My computer is fast enough to handle it all, but I tend to prefer alot of overhead in my processing power. Utilizing the system monitors, I very seldom go above 60% CPU usage, even when rendering full 3D drawings in Auto CAD, so I would tend to disagree with the "system hog" classification. I have also tried Vista Ultimate on slower/older machines, and can see some slowing down of the system, so the best warning here is to heed the minimum requirements. Most other issues that I have heard seem to stem from driver support, and there are several missing drivers for pretty common pieces of equipment. Usually beta drivers are available if you take some time to look, and it is always advisable to gather your drivers together onto a single CD or external drive prior to beginning any upgrade. All of my software has worked so far, with the exception of PalmOne Quick Install and my Lexmark printer companion software. As for Vista, it is a solid, reliable operating system that has so far proven to be secure and free from any major bugs. Constant updates solve the little problems as time goes by, and the enhance customization features allow you to tweak the system to get rid of anything that slows you down or even annoys you. Overall, I would call it far more solid than any previous version of Windows (including XP SP2). All-in-all it was an easy upgrade that left me with very little clean-up work to do when it was complete. As for those calling it a "rip-off" of Mac OSX, you've obviously not spent much time working with Vista or OSX. There are some similarities in user interface, but those are primarily in response to user feedback of what is desired in an operating system. Just because Ford was the first car manufacturer to use the pneumatic tire, does not mean that others were "ripping-off" their ideas when they too began to use them. In a capitalistic society, market demands drive product features, and Vista is an example of bringing more of those demands to the OS standard for PC based systems. While it is not as polished an OS as some might have hoped for, the foundation is solidly laid for add-ons, upgrades, and enhancements in security and functionality that will come over the next few years. I also feel secure in knowing that these upgrades and service packs are included in the price I have already paid. During that same time, I know that I will buy several upgrades for my Mac at around $130 each. The real point is this: "Know what you are getting into before you leap." Check compatibility for all of your hardware AND software before upgrading, and know what you will expect when the upgrade is complete. If you cannot live without a certain piece of your total system that is incompatible, DO NOT UPGRADE til the compatibility is worked out. Simple.. 
I previsouly used an accountant for my S-corp (federal, state and NYC) returns as well as (federal and state) personal returns. That can easily come to $1000. With turbotax you save a bunch around $750. The business product DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE RETURN which is another $50, and the NYC return is an additional $50 (available from inside the program). I used it the first time this year, I am pretty good with numbers, accounting and excel. It tool me well over 10 hours to enter the business returns after having all my numbers estimated in excel. The customer support by email was helpful as was the community forum, but responses are not always quick. and it is a time consuming process to research questions. The is VERY LITTLE GUIDANCE in filling out the state and NYC return. TT basically gives you the form and let you fill in the areas not generated by numbers on the federal return. TT reviews those returns for errors which certainly adds some value (relative to pencil and paper). It was too difficult for me to fill in state and NYC myself off the fed business return without any software, so I don't see that as an option (to save $100) despite the limited additional information needed. BOTTOM LINE - The first year using it will probably cause some of your hair to turn grey, subsequent years should be much easier. The navigation and interface is not intuitive enough for to make the first year smoot but over the years you can save a substancially in preparing you own taxes. One strategy might be to try it one year and run it by a tax accountant (as training wheels) and then in subsequent years do it on your own. (of course year one would be time consuming and expensive but that probably makes sense in the long run. 
The 2006 version is much improved over earlier versions. It took me only an average of 2 hours each to do two trust returns 
Very helpful. Had it reviewed by my CPA and he had only 2 minor comments and it is ready for submittal to IRS 
I usually dread installing and patching Turbo Tax. This is my 8th year using them and in the past it has been a headache to get the latest updates sometimes. This was a SMOOTH process. It self updates, downloads the patches, applies them and tells you when a module you are using is still going to be updated at a later date (and gives you that expected date too). I found this version to operate just like all the others, but the UPDATE experience is what really impressed me 
Thanks to a member of the development team assigned to online support, even down to phone calls and shared desktop technology the "stopper" issues are surmounted. Otherwise the program gets you home. To 
if you don't have this software, it is a must. I travel on business a lot, and could not live without it. However, if you have the 2006 version, don't bother with this. I still haven't found any real upgrades with noting. It does update roadways and locations if you need that. 
This product has met our needs ver well every year we've used it. We used the online only version last year, and it was slow and clunky (we couldn't pick up right where we'd left off). BUT... The desktop version is great! Faster than ever compared to earlier years, and no tax category was overlooked for personal or business. We ran it on Mac OS X 10.4.9. Buy with confidence 
Interface, Schedule C and handing Partnerships and multiple State Returns was SO MUCH better than last year. I don't know why maneuvering around the Federal Return is so much easier than the interface for State returns. I had to visit the Turbotax forum to get pointers on restarting the state interviews. You really have to review the printed returns because the software kept deleting one of my large tax credits that I couldn't add except through the forms option and outside of the interview. It took a few whacks at the apple to get the entry to stay in the final calculation. 
Excellent upgrade! Read all the problems other had, was concerned. Did a dual boot, kept XP just in case. One month latter no real issues. Upgraded from XP MCE, HP suppled all the driver updates. Cons: Learning where some options have been moved or hidden (they are still there). Did not like UAC, you can turn it off. I did for awhile, now I've left it on. A couple of freeze ups, only in the first days. Software - Upgraded NERO Pros: Faster start up - even with a complex system (3 hard drives) "Start Search" feature. "Voice Recognition" very good, there is a learning curve. "System Diagnostics" with a system tracking record. Also there is a VISTA compatible version of "Open Office" free download Have not used XP since (seems dated now). Congratulations Microsoft, job well done 
I have been reading these reviews for a while and wondering whether or not I should upgrade my laptop PC to Vista. Would I be an upgrade success story, or would I be one of the disgruntled reviewers whose PC now performs like a chimp? There was only one way to find out. I bought my laptop about a month before Vista was released, so I was entitled to order a free upgrade of Home Premium from Toshiba. I made the order one day, faxed my proof of purchase the day after, and my upgrade DVD arrived two weeks later. I am satisfied with how fast they sent me the package. Anyway, back to Vista. I'd read the reviews, took the good comments with the bad ones, used the Vista Upgrade Advisor, which told me all of my hardware was compatible with Vista and that I'd have to remove some software and drivers. I did everything I was told. All I had to do now was keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best. The upgrade DVD contained a link to an exe file that launched a help wizard that would guide me through updating my BIOS and removing incompatible drivers before launching the Vista installation. (I did an upgrade, not a clean install.) I didn't have to do anything -- just let the wizard uninstall the programs and reboot the computer when necessary. It involved no intervention on my part. Then came the actual installation of Vista. It was quick and painless (one hour), no blue screens of death or lockups. So far, so good. When Vista launched, things were a little crazy at first, with the OS recognizing new hardware and Toshiba's help wizard installing the new drivers. Things went a little awry at this point because the help wizard stayed stuck on a driver that wouldn't install. It would reboot and try to install the same driver again when it should have moved on to the next one. So I exited the wizard and decided to install the drivers myself (I had already saved most of them on a CD). Installing most of those drivers hadn't been necessary after all, for Microsoft had already installed most of those drivers anyway. The OS felt clunky at first, which meant some intervention was needed. I removed some applications from startup, managed the gadgets on my sidebar, and tweaked it around until Vista worked for my needs. It now runs smoothly. Despite my laptop having only 1 GB of RAM, it purrs like a kitten. Sometimes the OS is a resource hog, but not enough to render the PC useless. I haven't had much opportunity to use all of it and take advantage of its features, but this is what I like so far: * The interface. It's actually prettier than the Mac OS X (which I also own). The aero glass is very easy on the eye. I also like the 3-D flip and live thumbnails on the taskbar. I like the look of the Alt + Tab thumbnails much more than the ones on Windows XP. * The search bar on the Star menu. Of course, we already have that on Mac OS X, but it's nice to finally have it on Windows as well. I'm lazy and I don't like to have to look for stuff so this tool is very useful and attractive for me. * I like that it's more multimedia friendly than previous versions, including Windows XP Media Center Edition. I am able to burn DVDs and CDs and create movie montages with much more ease. (Though this tool is user-friendlier on the Mac.) * I like Windows Mail. It looks nicer and seems more secure than Microsoft Outlook. * It seems more secure. Windows Defender comes bundled with the OS now. I hope this OS can resist malware a little better than its predecessor. * The names of the processes running on the task manager are much clearer now. You get the names of the software and not just jargon like ehtray.exe, which you don't know what it is unless you google it. * Network connections are much easier to handle. My laptop now picks up on my home network the moment the computer boots up. I had to look for the connection and sign on with XP, but now I can go straight to browsing the Internet with Vista. There are, like all Windows OSs, cons as well: * I detest the whole Cancel/Allow thing. They ask me whether I want access to something I've just clicked on! Windows has gone from cautious to downright paranoid. The Cancel/Allow feature could be an useful tool in case an unwanted application tries to access my computer, but prompting me every time I click on a program, and a program I've clicked on numerous times at that, is just annoying as hell. Ugh. * I didn't like the huge desktop icons. So I right-clicked and switched to classic view. * I was lucky to find an anti-virus software that is compatible with Vista and that uses flawless real-time protection gratis (Avast! Antivirus), but I haven't been lucky finding a compatible third-party firewall. Neither Comodo Firewall Pro nor ZoneAlarm (free or pro), my two favorite firewalls, in that order, has released a Vista ready product. (They both claim to be working on it.) I am stuck using Windows Firewall for now. And I refuse to use Norton or McAfee Internet suites. They are resource hogs and overhyped products. Also, I've heard they are buggy with Vista. * This OS still comes with the typical Windows nuisances that I hate, like leaving folders and registry keys after uninstalling a program. I had hoped they'd found a way to fix that, but no suck luck. I still have to manually remove program leftovers. I guess Macs will always be far cleaner than PCs in that regard. * This "innovation" doesn't feel so innovative when you've been using most of the same features for years now. Mac OS X has had all of this stuff for a long time now, so the "Wow!" factor doesn't apply to me. As usual, instead of feeling that Microsoft has created something unique, I feel more like they have finally caught up with everything else that is out there, not only with Mac and Linux, but with other companies like Google and Mozilla. That is all the insight I have for now. I will edit the review as I continue to use it. All in all, Windows Vista is a vast improvement from previous installments and it's lovely eye candy to boot. I love to be ahead of technology and I'm relieved to finally have this on my laptop. (And even more relieved that I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it.) I know I'll be repeating this whole process again with the release of Leopard for my MacBook Pro. I also have Ubuntu, Kubuntu and DreamLinux to play around on Live CDs. I love seeing what is out there. As for potential buyers/upgrade hopefuls, all I can say is if you want to upgrade to Vista, give it a whirl. Don't let the negative reviews scare you -- instead, you should learn from their experiences. Use some common sense, from the best of your abilities at least, and make sure to use the upgrade advisor before you install it. Good luck! : 
If your into car racing sims then this one is for you. Great graphics and sounds. Excellent driving models. A must for online play 
I gave my grandson, ages 12 15, the Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007 for Christmas. I thought it would be a wonderful aide in the subjects they were studing at school. However, my concern was..."Would it be difficult to navigate and not be used or would they even use it enough to discover all the benefits of the software?" Well, they are raving about how great it has been in assisting them with their schoolwork...especially in Geometry and Algebra. Mom loves it too because the math help not only gives the answer but explains the steps on how to arrive at the answer. For my book...money well spent. It is so hard to buy a gift for teenagers that they get excited about... especially one that pertains to schoolwork. I was well pleased with their excitement about the product. I was satisfied with how easy the program was to use. Use the product once and you will find a live-in tutor 
Microsoft Student has exceeded my expectations. It includes Microsoft Math which is an incredibly useful program--it has the following advantages over a graphing calculator: 1) it is MUCH faster, 2) it can explains intermediate steps on certain types of algebra problems, 3) the user interface is both easier and more pleasant to work with, 4) symbolic input is allowed, meaning you can work with such things as cube roots without using clumsy keyboard workarounds, and 5) it is cheaper than a graphing calculator! I have not yet used the other components of MS Student, but they look promising, too 
This student helper software makes the best Santa's gift this Xmas! It's got tons of tools and runs smoothly on my PC. BTW it's on sale for almost free at Staples this week. Merry Xmas 
Easy to use and a lot of customer support to edge the learning curve 
Photoshop 3.0 has some great new features, but one of the best is "Auto Red Eye Removal." Removing red eye just takes one click. It's a real time saver. There are lots more. If you have an older version, you'll need to spend some time navigating 5.0, but you'll be impressed 
I use Photoshop as well as the other Adobe products in CS2 on a daily basis at work. This product provides a reasonably priced alternative for home use as well as providing a means for turning your home pictures and movies into a DVD. Amazon is wonderful about getting the products you order to you in a timely fashion 
I think this is an outstamdimg combination of digital image software. I have used a simpler version of Photoshop Elements in the past but this one has so many options that the learning curve makes it more difficult to master. However, it is worth it and I keep on learning its possibilities 
Installs easily and does what it does well. Love the fixing of photos and it is eas 
Only if the online version was this good. Had no problems. Simple to install and to uninstall. Started with Taxcut online, finished my Fed taxes only to discover I could not do my state taxes. Had to buy the flash drive. Next year I will just get the flash drive to start with 
Give them a break. So what, they don't support Macs. This is a Windows program. It is unfair to give this one star because it's a Windows specific program now. Everybody knows PC's are for office work and taxes, Macs are only for fun. Besides, it's on a flash drive! Cool 
My 10 year old daughter really loves the typing tutor. The only problem we had was the animated tutorial. It was cute, but lenghty. I would definitely recommend this program 
My 7 year old daughter loves playing with this typing instuctor game. It tracks her progress so we can see her accuracy and her speed in the days or weeks to come. It shows the child in an easy an accurate way finger placement. I think there is up to 11 games to play, but we haven't gotten that far yet. I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because we haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. Love it so far 
Time and time again this program has allowed me to create wonderful VCDs for all my life's important events. Now at every important large family event a slide show is expected. A slide show was played at my grandparents wedding anniversary, the family reunion, and Christmas 2005 2006. Everybody enjoys watching them and I truly enjoy creating them. The first time I tried to create a VCD I was confused on exactly what I needed to do. I wondered to myself "what are PAL and NTSC settings, and what in the heck a SVCD is?" I was not at all experienced with video technology. I phoned technical support with these questions and many more. The representative was more then helpful; he basically held my hand through the first VCD creation. Then he patiently and professionally let me "pick his brain". I am now an expert in video creation. I even bought a DVD player that supports PAL and NTSC so that I can swap videos with my uncle in England. This program was diffidently worth its weight in gold! At this moment I am expecting the new version 2 to arrive and provide hours of entertainment for myself and my family.  
Please don't expect to get the rebate. I was very disappointed in the rebate offer. I sent it in when I received the software. The rebate never came so I checked on it they told me how to fax it to them. Didn't hear anything after I did that. Everytime I tried to check on line it did not show again. So I started trying everyway I could to contact them. Finally, I got a response back to fax it again. Right away, I started contacting them with no answer until finally one day in January-I got two responses-"sorry this promotion is out of date now". This is after I felt I had to get nasty with them sending messages through the website to customer service that no one was answering me. So don't expect to see your rebate. They didn't care at all about the fact that it was sent to them and I started contacting them in time. I feel that it is a "come on". It is a good product-just don't lie to your customers. 
Good product. Easy to use. Does automatic internet searches for you and brings you the results. Would definitely recommend this product 
If the "free" Ancestry.com subscription is a consideration in your decision to purchase Family Tree Maker, you might want to know there are strings attached. Even though the 9 months are free, Ancestry.com requires a credit card number along with your name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. Why would they want that information unless they intend to automatically bill you and extend the subscription at the end of 9 months? No information is provided on how to to cancel the subscription at the end of the free period 
I have enjoyed using Family Tree Maker. It helps to organize genealogy data and is easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone working on their family history 
Amazon is easy to access, easy to order from. It's also easy to find what you are looking for. Amazon also has great shipping. I have been very happy with anything I have ordered from Amazon 
I am a s/w professional and I been using this product suite for the last 2 years and i am happy with this. This is a wonderful product except Pestpatrol which made my system very slower (sometimes) during startup 
I got this for my room-mate and she just loves it. She uses it everyday and likes all the different things you can do with it...it will automatically divide the Bible chapters so you can read it in an entire year and the memorizing tool are her 2 favorites 
This has been a great gift for my husband, who commutes on the Metro. It's made it easier for him to find time to read the Word, and he enjoys using it during church as well! No problems 
works like advertised--have your info ready and it will prompt you thru the necessary forms, saving the caculations and determinations for behind the scenes processing. This leaves you with a concise, good-to-go tax return. If you ever manually processed more than a very simple return, you know exactly what I mean 
I bought this last year and just upgraded to 2007 lets see how it works. 2006 verson was great i never had a single virus in last 1 year 3 months 
After going through weeks with activation problems with Norton Anti-virus and then for them to tell me to get off dial up and go the high speed internet in order to get their product to work and still come up with the activation hang up, I then was referred to PC-Cillin. It was difficult to switch, because you get use to Norton, but now I am fine and my computer has been okay so far. It's recommended by most computer technicians.. 
I can't say enough about Microsoft OneNote 2007. This product is exactly what I have been seeking for a long time...you can save everything from website shots, files, scans, photos, audio, video, links, drawings, free text, handwriting, etc. Just about anything you can think of to compile and organize can be compiled and organized in OneNote. The interface is designed as a series of virtual notebooks that can be divided into sections and chapters, with an infinite number of pages in each section. Each page also has its own title, as well. Best of all, the entire program is completely searchable--even scanned documents are searchable with OCR technology. The searches are lightning fast and extremey accurate, I must say. THis makes the program excellent for datebooks, planners, address books, contact list, agendas, lists, the myriad of things we need to remember, product links for user manuals, genealogy info, cool website links that you don't want to clog up your "favorites" with, and just about any type of research or project. The notebooks are share-able within a network and real-time syncable as well as usable with tablet notebook technology. I do wish that Microsoft had integrated the same toolbar "ribbon" interface that some of the other Microsoft Office 2007 products received... All in all, I think users will find that OneNote is one of the most useful programs available for collecting and organizing information from many different venues. Compiling the sticky notes of my life into one organized and retrievable composite has simplified my existence beyond belief. I highly recommend this product. I am a textbook ADD humanoid, and I needed a simple system that is easily searched. I LOVE the OneNote notebook system. Information is so easy (and--dare I say it?--FUN) for me to find what I need immediately on my laptop. In my previous life, I would easily spend twenty frustrating minutes rummaging through three or four messy desk drawers just to find the little scrap of "important" paper that I remember saving three months ago. One Note is well worth the $79 I paid for it. It is also available as a free trial from Microsoft. Give it a try and see how it can help you simplify your life.. 
Microsoft's OneNote is a vast improvement over its original release. It is more intuitive, easier to navigate and just plain easier to use. As a writer it has significantly improved my productivity in compiling interivews and notes for my articles. I recommend it very highly and I do not, as a rule, make such recommendations lightly. More bang for the buck 
Happy that item still works great with the vista upgrad 
It is very broad and improved compared to the 2006 version and the fact that you can update topics via their website is awesome 
In the aftermath of Katrina I found myself wanting to help people anyway I could. I ordered this program so I could design my own t-shirts and sell them. I designed my own art and inserted it in to the program. People seem to love them. So far I have raised $1700.00 for Katrina victims 
They changed and made Microsoft Office 2007 more in line with the flashy new Vista operating system. Problem with that is you need to relearn a lot of steps. Microsoft has a good interactive web site that without it I may never have mastered the new "improvements". Now that I'm getting used to it, I have to think I like it better if not just because it's a lot flashier to look at 
It is very functional, I like it a lot 
No matter where you are with your PC, whether its brand new or a few years old get this if your using the internet.I had been previously dealing with spyware, viruses and other nasty stuff until I got Spysweeper. I used Mcaffe, Adaware, Spy Bot and a couple others. None of them could clean my system or find the root problem.I would still have a Utillities program to use and maybe another Antivirus program but for the hardcore stuff Spysweeper is the best. Thanks Spysweeper, A happy customer 
Every anti-spyware program has its pros and cons... no single program can find everything... Pros: Its had good reviews in a couple of magazines, and on NPR. It has an Internet Shield, Startup Shield, etc so it can alert you if anything has been added to your PC that you don't want. It finds some things that other programs do not (and other programs find things that this does not). Cons: Cost. Ad aware and Spybot search and destroy are free. Also, I'm not sure how up to date they keep their database. Its one of the OK programs if you decide to pay for one. E-trust's pest patrol has had better reviews (Maximim PC). Overall grade: B 
Great software - is capable of keeping your pc clean 100%. Would highly recommen 
I have had both McAfee and Norton over the past three years. McAfee subsriptions would expire early and customer service could never help long term. Their website was no help. Norton's hindered my system performance dramatically and its' Junk Mail interface would only sporadically load in Outlook. I did my research this time and heard much the same from other reviewers. Purchased Zone Alarm, received a competitive rebate from my old Norton disk and installed it. It installed smoothly and interfaces seamlessly with my Outlook, doing a great job in segregating Spam. The ratings filters work great and my system just hums along. The scans and automatic updates work perfectly. No complaints here and I have had it over 3 month 
When I first switched over to the Mac (after years of believing in Windows XP's superiority, mind you), it was a Powerbook G4 with Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. After using it for just a few minutes, I was finally convinced that I was wrong about Mac vs. Windows in a big way. Once you get used to it, OS X is not only easier to use, but it is prettier, more powerful, and far more stable as well. Tiger improves on that platform. My favorite new feature is Dashboard, which brings a whole bunch of handy little apps to your fingertips, such as a calculator, calendar, stock tracker, weather forecast, dictionary, sticky notes, and hundreds more available for download at Apple's website. Spotlight is also a cool feature; certainly better than any other search feature I've used. Microsoft will be coming out with its new Vista OS pretty soon, which basically steals most of OS X's ideas. Personally, I could care less. Give me OS X any day. I will be one of the first in line to buy Leopard when it comes out this spring 
I had been using Mac OS X 10.3 for a really long time, and it was running very slow since about 75 percent of my hard drive consists of iTunes stuff. I don't know how it happens but it does and i decided to upgrade to version 10.4 and it is definently worth it. The installation process doesn't take too long but it isn't two seconds either and once you get it all going, it keeps your mac exactly the same and it runs at a quicker speed which is great, and it has an added feature with things called Widgets which are great because they are very helpful in daily life, when you wake up, you can click the area for widgets and the time comes up along with the weather and a 6 day forecast and my favorite feature is the Flight Tracker feature because i do a lot of flying so now i don't have to log on to the airtran website, i can look at the widget and it gives me all the flight info, like being on time or delayed. So i say you have to get it, or miss out on the fun 
I have used Microsoft Office for PC in the past. This product for the MAC is great 
If you just need to type a few emails to friends or to make a little flyer for a party or something, just get a cheap program. But if you are a professional writer or want something that can do it all after you invest a little time learning your way around, buy the MS Office, Standard or Professional as your needs require. I bought the Mac version and love the way it looks on my big high def. 24" iMac, 2 pages wide. I am producing a book with it. If your IQ is below 50 it may be too much to handle. Otherwise, bite the bullit and get the features it offers. I also do training and seminars with Powerpoint and look forward to using the new additions added to this latest (2004) upgrade. P. S.: Ever notice how the people who write the majority of these reviews never should have passed any English class because they can't spell the most basic words in the language. And they expect us to give some credibility to their negative, "cry baby" reviews 
I read reviews constantly, but my questions never seem to get answered. So I will try to answer the questions that I had about this item. First, It works really well. Second, it's easy. Third, for the price, this is probably the best you'll get. This item comes with the software to instantly burn DVDs. Plug this into your USB port after installing the software. Click on the Instant DVD Recorder, and use the advanced option. You get the whole menu on your screen, you pick what you want, and bam, your video is now recording right to disk. Quality? It's fine, you're going from tape to DVD, it will still be tape quality. Cautions: Make sure your computer/laptop isn't too old. This item NEEDS USB 2.0. Get an PMCIA adapter card if you're still running USB 1.1. Online auctions sell them cheaply. 
I ran into a problem trying to install an upgrade that can be downloaded from the Pinnacle website. The on-line help was very helpful and after two personal messages I got the installation to work. The product works as advertised and the Studio10 movie editor is very nice. 
what it does is awesome, unfortunately i wasn't able to make it work with adobe premiere on my computer, so if i want to capture with it i'd have to use the included pinnacle software. the free software works and it's pretty intuitive, but it takes way longer to load than premiere (for me anyway) and doesn't do what premiere does. overall, great product, just needs more compatability 
this item was bought for a friend's grandaughter after purchasing the math software of the same character. Her reading level has improved since using this program. We're hoping more of Mia's software will be available for other subjects. I recommend the Mia series for young children to help them increase their reading and math skills 
CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number. i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me. Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on) Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on) (EDIT: i learned this IS possible in Illustrator CS2 via the EDIT/Keyboard Shortcuts, or Alt+Shift+Ctrl+K) In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me. So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly. 
I have had the last two preceding versions, and this one far exceeds them in ease of use and stability. There are more cliparts, pictures and other things on several discs to give you most anything you are looking for 
I've been using graphics apps since they were invented and I remember well who has been the first to invent new features in the major drawing apps. In the old days illustrator had almost no market share because, well lets just say it had no market share. it is in my humble opinion the most difficult program to learn and to use I have ever seen. Freehand by contrast was adroit, thus it had all the market share on the mac platform and has for instants always been united press internationals world standard. with the release of version 7 of freehand macromedia announced that in order to reduce the apps growing tool set they would now build controls into objects. perhaps this is why some neophyte reviewers think coreldraw is a knockoff of freehand but in point of fact this was corels original innovation in version one of corel draw many many years before freehand copied it. Some of illustrators newest features like the ability to add spot colors to a bitmap were in version 3 or earlier of the corel package. Draw was the first program to offer true transparent vector objects, gradient transparency of vector or raster objects, interactive controls and draws vector lens effects are simply incomparable. The list could go on for days. Corel Draw today is by far the most capable app in the world. It's feature set is unapproached by illustrator. It's output to any device is always flawless and for my money it's lightyears ahead 
Excellent program with many features like owning a real aquarium.The only catch is going to the website to get additional fish, etc....I still want a trigger fis 
I received this as a gift and I am very impressed with the quality compared to other PC screen-saver aquariums I have seen. You may also see it used as a demo in stores that sell PCs. The fish are highly realistic in the way they move as well as the 3D graphics. Watching fish move in and out of the gently waving tentacles of a sea anemone is almost as fascinating as the real thing. There is also a FishCam mode from a fish POV. You can select different aquariums and then add one or more fish from a selection of about 40. The choice of aquarium effects the choice of fish. Additional fish can be purchased online. If you have an older PC this program may not work well for you. The requirements include "3D graphics acceleration and support for DirectX 8.1". Also, I have not found a way to display the aquarium across multiple monitors. It would be great to see fish swim from one monitor over to the other. 
iPhoto 2006 is a huge improvement over the last version 
I'm a big fan of iWork and have always looked for new office apps that out-perform Microsoft's apps which have become so feature-rich that functionality has become akward. I love Pages and the formatting features it provides. I do more layout work than word processing so I'm real happy with the way Pages works for me. Keynote is nice too. I don't believe in lots of slide transitions and builds when making a presentation so a lot of the flash and panash that PowerPoint tries to interject is useless to me. You have lots of capability with Keynote but its clean, simple interface and robust formatting and import capabilities really works for me. Nice package to be sure! I would love to see a spreadsheet tool incorporated into iWork that is cross functional moreso than with Excel 2004 for Mac. I think that Appleworks is a great start but needs to be taken to the next level. Perhaps capture the spreadsheet piece from OpenOffice and build into a component of iWork and call it "Tabular" or "Sheets". (just a suggestion 
Apple's iWork software presents two applications: Pages and Keynote which is Apple's answer to Microsoft's Publisher and Power Point. As someone who has used both, I can honestly say that iWork blows Publisher and Power Point clean out of the water. Keynote has some added features such as 3D graphs and the capaibility to add numbers in charts (like a very limited spread sheet) added in this version. You can make truly professional looking mind blowing presentations with Keynote that will make any presentation look like a multimedia jewel. Pages allows you to do desktop publishing and print media with the finesse and end results of professional looking print catalogs and brochures. Both applications are well designed and, just like all of the iLife apps, feature the classic Apple interface whereby all of your media content is available and intermeshed into the work flow. There is not really any new earth shattering features in 06 from the 05 version, but mainly just tweaks and enhancements. By far, the biggest disappointment is in the lack of upgrade pricing availability for users of the previous versions. You will have to pay full price even if you bought iWork '05. The family pack version for $99 is a really good buy as you get five licensed copies versus the single user copy which only gives you one installation for $79. The family pack is definitely the way to go especially if you need to install to more than one Mac. This is an excellent product that works really tight. I only give four stars for no upgrade pricing and for no new applications bundled with the package. If you need to do slide show presentations in front of a group, then the purchase price is worth the cost of Keynote alone. It really rocks 
R u board with PowerPoint? Business meeting seem to go no where! U think u have seen it all till u try KeyNote! Folks I landed a promotion thanks to KeyNote just last week! I had a major presentation for a major central monetary agency (dead serious types) and I can tell u that they have never seen anything like KeyNote! I have yet to try PAGES but Keynote is the best presentation tool out there. Takes a bit of getting used to since we (the business users) have been on PowerPoint like forever! The best part is after I finished my 57 page presentation it was exported flawlessly to PowerPoint (without the special cinematic effects of course) and PDF and QuickTime movie! You can also import from Powerpoint but u must use your styles carefully so u don't end up tweaking each slide in keynote. Next time I am starting my entire project in keynote. (it does a flawless job of exporting but importing needs some work) If u wana wow the crowd with simple and graceful presentations (like the one's Steve throws @ Mac Expo) You open your mind to Keynote! A must have. Other wow products BTW I have been using on my MacMini is Merlin (the best Project management software ever) Good Luck to al 
Working with Photoshop Lightroom First, I click on develop and then click on Basic sliders. Next, I use the sliders to send instructions to Photoshop Lightroom stored in my hard drive's Picture folder. The Metadata allows me to name my photo images. Lightroom does not change my flash card digital numbers. You can Heal photo spots and blemishes with Photoshop Lightroom. Check out the excellent help menu in Photoshop Lightroom. The Remove Spots tool lets you repair a selected area of a photo with a sample from another area. In the Develop module, select the Remove Spots tool from the Lightroom Toolbar. Using the Toolbar Clone: Applies the sampled area of the photo to the selected area. Heal: Match the texture, lighting, and shading of the sampled area to the selected area. (Optional) In the Toolbar, drag the Spot Size slider to specify the size of the area affected by the Remove Spots tool. Keywords become my search engine for locating my edited photo images. My favorite Photoshop Lightroom keyboard shortcuts and Function Keys: B - Add to Quick Collection *D - Loupe view E - Jump to Library in Loupe View G - Grid View in Library module L - Cycles through Light Out modes *N - Remove spots R - Crop the overlays T - Hide/Show Toolbar V - Grayscale/Color Z - Zoom to 100% Control-Click Virtual Copy Function Keys F5 to F8 Various functions *The above missing Keyboard shortcuts letter functions. Excellent Instructions in Photoshop Lightroom Photoshop Lightroom is nondestructive editing of your photos. Your photographs are not changed by Photoshop Lightroom. Your photo changes are stored in metadata as a series of instructions. This saves your hard drive space because you do not have to save your edited photographs. Lightroom applies instructions to the original photo file. This allows you complete control over your photographs. Changes you make to your photo images are reversible. Pro Reaction The answer is Photoshop Lightroom 1.0 developed for professional photographers. This is the Adobe application that is quick and easy to use for editing your digital photographs. Now, you can create your own digital photo style and look. You have elegance and power in your hands when you use Lightroom application. The Photoshop Lightroom tool suite is powerful. You can use Photoshop Elements or Photoshop CS2 for your difficult photo editing work. The fill colors in Photoshop Lightroom are white, light grays to dark gray and black. Lightroom's Library views are grid and loupe. You can use Lightroom's clone stamp features and make virtual copies of your photos. Con Reaction More fill color themes in the preference file would be a good addition since Photoshop Lightroom's interface is black. Different color theme interfaces in the preference file would be a good addition to Lightroom. Keyboard shortcuts is incomplete. The following are the missing letter functions: N - Remove spots, D - Loupe view, Control-Click Virtual Copy. There is no help menu's mention of Function Keys F5 to F8 for Photoshop Lightroom's various functions. Final Notes Photoshop Lightroom allows you to spend less time sorting and organizing images. You have more time to shoot and edit your digital photos. 
I've just started using Lightroom 1.0 and I love it. I especially love the organizational capabilities and the develop module is terrific. There is a bit of a learning curve, but with time I know that Lightroom and I will be producing some superb images. I'm not sure yet if I will bite the bullet for CS3. Digital photography is always expanding, always improving and alas....always getting more expensive. What does annoy me is the current trend towards very little printed documentation. Lightroom arrived with a little booklet...only much later did I discover the documentation file on the cd. What ever happened to providing a basic book with the software??? 
It is very easy to go wrong with this product. It is being brought out in a relatively simple form that you just know is going to grow. It is NOT photoshop or even photoshop like. It isn't what you use to fix a picture (though you sure can). Something has happened. Film is going away. People used to have to pay for film and for images that were anything from totally black to whiteout with maybe 1 good image out of 24? Now we preview and shoot freebies as digital. Lots and lots of pictures. Some of us shoot over 1000 images in one outing. Ohhhh, but it gets more hairy than that. Now digital cameras are taking images that are as good in print as film. And - if you use the original data from the camera (in raw form called RAW data) rather than an automatically interpreted shrunk (JPEG) version, you might even get paid money for what you take. But those unshrunk RAW files are big? Yes. So how do you zip through 1000 RAW data files and sort them into Aunty EM, Lion, Scare Crow, Oz... or make a slide show, or print certain ones or make contact sheets. and brighten 30 at a time or boost the contrast in this bunch - fast. Lightroom 
This is being written without any corrections. It is certainly a lot easier than manually typing for someone who can't type worth a darn. Recommend it highl 
I have used a voice to text translation device for several years. I was interested in the Dragon NaturallySpeaking product for two reasons. My current product is much less accurate than I would choose. Secondly, it does not provide automatic punctuation. The advertisement for Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard suggested that it not only increased accuracy, but did that without training, and it provided autopunctuation. I purchased the product and met with a disappointment when it arrived. Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard will not install with less than 512 MB of RAM. I didn't know that. My machine had 256 MB. I had to purchase an additional 512 MB in order to load the product. While I was waiting for the memory to come, I used the new microphone on my old product. The new microphone was at least five times better than my old one. The accuracy went up. I was very happy about that. When the memory arrived, I installed the product. I was surprised when it asked to go through a training exercise, but I did it anyway. I was impressed with the increased accuracy. That was very good, but the autopunctuation wasn't there. I found out that that is an option. When I turned on the option. It began to work. It doesn't do as good a job as I would hope, but for normal sentences, it's okay. All in all, I like the new product. I also like the rebate that may be quite affordable. I hope this evaluation helps 
It's late at night and this will be a quick review based on my experience with VISTA business. I've only used the product for a week. First, i'm at experienced PC user and like to always keep up to date with the latest hardware. I was reluctant to upgrade to VISTA at first because it didn't support my online postage provider's software (so I thought) as well as a game I play (that's now supported, but wasn't at first). The one big thing that held me back from the upgrade is that Microsoft sure loves to confuse the customer. Until I ran the Upgrade Advisor I had no clue that the Vista Home Premium Upgrade couldn't be used to upgrade XP Pro without a clean install. In the end I had to go with this version. I normally refuse to upgrade an OS without doing a clean install first. That's for a very good reason! One last thing I don't like about Vista is that you can't do a VISTA clean install with the upgrade without first installing XP. Why is this? So, I opened the box and put the disc in after removing several programs from startup such as my anti-virus program. The upgrade went perfectly fine and I ran into no problems at all. I was never once asked for a driver disc. Really. At first I was surprised at how much background hard drive activity there was at first even when the system was not doing anything. I fixed that by disabling some things in Vista that run in the background. That seemed to help and I don't experience this as much anymore. Overall, programs seem to run just as fast as they did in XP. Maybe a little slower, but I haven't noticed much at all. All my old programs ran fine. My online postage software, Internet Security software and even my Video Capture program. So far I haven't found anything that hasn't run properly, but that'll probably change soon. I did however have one graphical glitch. There was a weird halo effect around my mouse pointer. It seemed to clear up a little bit when I installed some new Nvidia Beta drivers for my 7800GT. It still occurs, but rarely. I also had some problems with the Windows Switcher randomly going to non-3d mode. I didn't realize at first it will not work in 3d mode without the Aero theme enabled. I don't understand why this is. To be truly honest, i'm generally not a fan of Microsoft products. I'll use them and that's about it. I really thought i'd hate Vista, but I actually like it.. a lot actually. Sorry to sound like a commercial, but I really enjoy using it. I really have no clue why it's so expensive though! The price is way too high. The basic edition is priced ok, but I don't get why the other versions cost so much more. I'm sure i'll come up with some bad things to say eventually. A few things have been annoying, but I can fix them with a little work. I'm quite annoyed that at default you can't delete or save to the root directory of C: without special permission. No big deal. The backup feature is nice. I currently have my entire drive backed up every morning at 8am through the Windows Task Scheduler. There was no "easy" way to do this. I had to do some checking online for the settings to add this to the task scheduler. I also found it strange that the other got I received an error message saying I couldn't edit video from an external drive without copying it to my main drive first! Hopefully I can figure out why this occured. Something I can fix quickly I hope. Overall, I like it a lot. I definitely wouldn't bother installing it on a computer that's over a year old though. I imagine it would be pretty slow. 
Having been an avid windows user (from 95 to XP) my fascination for OS X snuck up on me slowly. Having to run a mac only scientific application, we got a powermac in 2001 that came with 10.0, the very first flavor of OS X. RIght on my first day with OS X, I figured out all the PC equivalents to personalize it to my taste and even set it to share files with PCs in our windows network - just plug and play, no IT help EVER required (Windows XP Pro won't do squat without the IT guy comes and binds it with his magic password!) Imagine you going to a completely foreign place and start communicating with the locals BETTER than the locals themselves...that's how it was! That was when I realized the legendary ease of use and the silent power of OS X. I have OS X on three machines now and one is mac mini as a home server (OS X ships with everything you need - apache, PHP, PERL etc to run professional server at home!) OS X never requires a reboot - except when software update wants a reboot. They run for months sans choking up like PCs that are up for a few days. Besides running your own apache server, you could train an electronic slave called Automator to fetch your newspaper and print the pages you want every morning before you wake up; get organized with industrial quality apps like Mail, iCal and Address Book; get any of the several thousand Widgets to satisfy your fetishes...and I am only beginning to understand the power of this OS. The possibilities seem endless. Trust me - you will not miss windows - you will not regret if you switch. I have not touched my Vaio in years. Speicifically to address one reviewer below: No matter what your field is, you might like, enjoy and benefit from OS X. I know people in many of those categories he classified as 'better off with PCs' that use a Mac as their personal computer (some of them boot windows in it so as to earn their wage as IT specialists for large windows networks - go figure!) Unlike what he claims, IMAP access with Apple Mail is fantastic, easy and delightful. Haven't had a single issue with two and half years of accessing my mail from a MS exchange server. If you have a mission critical application that only runs on windows, even then Parallels can launch Windows XP inside OS X in 10 seconds and you are good to go. I do this for using my MS Streets and Trips. The only deficit in software on mac platform, in my opinion - no good mapping software. 
First off, I gave it 4 stars because for windows users- 5 star product, but for mac users- 3 stars windows users- if you're still using windows, you are missing out on no more troubleshooting problems, great user interface and next gen features like spotlight, dashboard and of course the great iLife. Tiger is about two times better than vista ultimate, and combining that with the expensive price, tiger is 8 times better. Even though vista copies many of the features in tiger, they are far from being as productive and easy-to-use as tiger's (not to mention tons of bugs and problems). SO GET A MAC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! [... 
I purchased a PowerBook last year, so I was forced to start using OSX. Up to that time, I was using OS 9.2 on my G4 tower. Within a month of using OSX on my notebook, I almost completely stopped using my desktop computer because its operating system was so outdated. Finally, I updated to OSX on the tower. Now I have two great computers to work from. OSX rocks 
Very easy to install. Watch for print drivers that will need updating. So far system has been running fine 
OS X is solid, stabe, and easy to use. But don't think it's not powerful--with the Unix core you can get as far under the hood as you care to learn about 
I had the Hallmark card program on my last PC, and found it to be comprehensive then. The Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2007 is full of professional-looking graphics, and is easy to use. However, I would have paid the price for this programme just for the Event reminder calendar! I have all the family birthdays, and various appointments entered into it, and each time I boot up, the reminder pops up on the screen. Brilliant 
This is a great program for making all kinds of cards. You can add your own pictures and text very easily, personalizing the cards. There is a huge variety of cards for all occassions. Also the event planner is very user friendly and you can easily import all your important information. I really love this product. I have had other programs of this type, but the Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe is the very best 
I've owned previous versions of this program and this one has not let me down! Easy installation, easy instructions, beautiful artwork! Can't ask for anything better 
Excellent product, but unfortunately no business cards. That would have made it perfect. The ease of use is simple. Lots of downloads available too. I really love this software, especially the E-Cards 
These is a great software ! Fun and educational my entire family plays with it. It is fun for all ages. And it is a great deal 
The Kid Pix software is a treasure...It is very user friendly and easy to learn. I especially like the templates that kids can choose the colors and fill in the pictures, as well as being able to draw freestyle. I used it for drawing cells, water cycles, atoms and labeling the digestive systems organs for a science class. It worked superbly because I have trouble drawing stick people so I could redo some things as often as needed until they were good enough to submit for grading. Thanks Learning Company, I would recommend this product to anyone needing a beginning art program 
My grand child, 8, requested this program specifically. She used it at school and said she'd have many uses for it with her school work. She loves it and I've been impressed with all this program does. The price is very reasonable for the product. 
Fantastic product. Great for CNC and laser engraving work. A great product even better 
This is an awesome product. Very easy to manipulate photos and make stunning layouts using the premade pages. Perfect for putting together a book when you don't have a lot of time. My college age children LOVE the results 
I love to scrapbook. When I am doing my own scrapbook I still have to go on to the computer and pick and print my pictures. With this program I do it all on the computer and get the same finished prodct. I work a couple of books together one with the computer and one with all my own supplies. Keeps my creative memories and stampin up products in use while I can put something together a little quicker when needed with this program. Have a blast with it ~ I do! 
This is a great way to enjoy comics of the past. I enjoyed reading them all. One thing that use to get on my nerves is you buy a comic and the story is never finished, and you may never read the ending of the story if you can't get the next issue. This was great because I could read each issue without wondering what happened they are all there for me to read. I hope they continue to put the most popular back issues on CD/DVD. It is just great 
This is a great set of cool old Marvel Comics, which, I think, is somewhat associated with Marvel editor Ralph Machio. The problem I have is that, some of the covers are not from the original comics. They're from the Marvel Masterworks Reprints editions. Spider-Man and The Avengers seem to include all of the original covers... but... The X-Men #s 1 though 7 look like heck (Not Don). They are missing all the very nice half-tone blends and toned grays that were apparent on all the early Marvel comics. The insides look pretty good. They've been photoshopped to make the borders and gutters white - which is fine, I guess. But I like the look of the yellowed cheap newsprint (inside the panels), because that's what old comics were made from... If you spend a lot of time perusing these gems... I'll bet you can almost smell the old paper and mildew 
The future of Comics Collecting Ultimate X Men the Complete Comic Collection on CD ROM is available at Best Buy for $9.99 and it's a keeper if you love the new Ultimate X Men. When I would ask about comics on CD and DVD ROM I'd get these strange looks from clerks who'd say "who'd want to buy that?", but it's catching on as a new way to look at comics. It's the ideal format for preserving comics history. You won't feel guilt about selling your old comics and trade paperback books when you have this. I like them because you can install these on a laptop or any PC or MAC. Gone are the days of having an entire room to store your old comics. You can slab them and sell them (the paper versions) on E BAY because you can always read them forever on disc. GIT Corp was smart enough to include the annual in this edition. GIT, if your reading all future collections should include crossovers. That was the mistake of the Avengers and X Men DVD ROM comic collections. Without the crossover issues a fan can't read the entire story arc. One of the best aspects of the Ultimate series is the artwork. A lot of care was taken to show that these represent the next generation of X Men. We might be downloading new comics instead of purchasing them in a shop 5 years from now. 
Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them. Plus it is only 70 issues but for 9 bucks thats awesome. I think they could have put another series on the disc like the complete X force or Exiles or something just to fill it out more.Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics. 
This is the second year I have used this product. I found it simple to follow and a great convenience since we were doing all our taxes manually before. It was even better this year since it automatically imported entries from last year saving me the time of re-inputing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to simplify the tax process! I had no problems with the install either 
I am 100% satified with the product and the price. We have used the program and GPS to guide us to a destination point and it works great. 
This system is very good for road trips. I just went on a road trip for spring break and it worked. I had a similar system from back in 1999 from Co-Pilot. The Co-pilot system was not a accurate but had some features that should have been in Streets and Trips. For instance Co-pilot had a voice recognition and could verbalize the turn by turn directions. It could also answer select question such a 'how far' 'next turn'... Over all I am giving Streets and Trips 4 stars because is does have a great receiver and an incredible number of points of interest. I would buy it again but just expected more from a product 8 years newer than my last system. I mean think about how far laptops have come. 
Excellent product for major cities. It will be better once I find out where to find the cities I want. I don't think EVERY city is available. Otherwise it's pretty goo 
Pros: Simple to setup and use CD has S/W easy to install Editing capability to fine tune tracks' start and end times Cons: Default in Wave Corrector program not to put a suffix can be changed but on each save; cannot change default setting permanently. Intensive PC activity may cause program to skip a moment in recording (start that track over). Cannot append to an existing file. Could do a better job of finding gaps between tracks. Despite the Cons (I'm just telling you what could be better), the product does a good job of copying records and cleaning the sound. Worth the money if you have records in good shape and hate to spend money buying CDs to get them portable. Peace, LJ 
I've used Quicken since around 2004-2005, and have upgraded with each new release. Quicken 2007 is not without a few bugs and quirks, but has nonetheless served as a worthy upgrade for me, and I certainly have not had the dismal experience that some are reporting. The primary change in 2007 is the interface. It's just much easier for me to find and run reports in this version. I also love the cash flow feature integrated with the calendar, where you can set up known income expenses and monitor your cash flow. Just a great tool. I also found it easy to set up accounts and integrate with credit card statements. I have not yet set up investments or mortgage but that's the next step. There have been a few quirks. A couple of times I've clicked a button and the program has just closed. Also, I had to reinstall the product at one point because the automated account setup screen kept popping up every time I started the program (actually the underlying reason why I did a reinstall was b/c I was a bit hasty and set up some things incorrectly; once I figured out what I'd done I decided it's just be easier to start from scratch). But the reinstall did seem to solve the problem with the setup screen. About the only thing I can say that I don't like about the program is that when you are in the register, the control buttons for that entry do not allow you to see the next line item in the registry. A few times I've been looking for a specific expense and it was hidden just b/c I so happened to be on the entry above it. However this is a relatively minor issue. In short, if you're happy with Quicken 2006 then you probably don't need to spend the money on an upgrade at this point. But if you've found some of the reporting and other features a little cumbersome to figure out, then 2007 solves this problem with a much cleaner interface 
Norton has maintained its status-quo over the years and has not failed with the 360 suite. Runs in the background and never hinders PC performance (except during inception). Norton, you always come through 
I don't understand why people are having issues with the program unless they are not uninstalling all protective software first (anti-virus, anti-spyware, and Fire walls) Warning if you have Norton products download the free Norton removal program just search on Google (symnrt) download it and run it than all Norton products will be removed any that don't uninstall can be removed safely from the add remove program that windows has. Restart the pc and than install the program. do a full update using live update and restart after doing that the program should have no flaws. Now on to the pc i put it on to prove that yes it runs on slow and old systems. I have a laptop with a centrino processor running at 1.7 ghz 512 mb of ram 80 gig 5200 rpm hard drive and to test the capability while scanning i ran the cleanup wizard and the anti-virus scans at the same time while playing solitaire the system manager while these were going on didn't rise above 90% and the scanners changed speed to accommodate each other. As for my tech skills I work in a IT dept that services customers computers for a large retail and I feel confident on recommending this product for vista along with trend micro pccillin. Now to those who read the negative reviews and are getting vista do not buy McAfee because it is not certified for vista the only two anti virus companies that have received certification is Norton and Trend Micro because McAfee is not certified it is not guaranteed to protect your system. If you want to see a list of certified programs go to Microsofts website and search for vista compatibility and they have a list that they have certified and one that is compatible but might have issues use this site before buying security programs for Vist 
Bought this usb gps just before christmas for my trips to Virginia and DC. Had to weigh it against a similar product from Garmin. But the price, usability track record of Microsoft and user reviews persuaded me towards this MS product. I must say, this is an excellent value for money. Not only does it it give unambiguous directions (voice), other feature like GPS trail help you determine HOW lost you are from the actual route. Also you can recalculate the route from your current position. The voice giudance in one or two instances was a bit slow, but I pretty much got adequate time to make the turns and merges in nearly all instances. Extremely useful during night driving when it becomes difficult to read street names. The maps are very detailed and some cool features like "Nearest Items" (gas statn, railways stn, bus terminals, restaurants, hotes, etc) impressed me very much. Since this plugs into your laptop, its is best suited for your navigator, although I did make long trip with the laptop on the front seat and just listening to the voice driving directions. But since it does not call out the street names but shows it on display, you would neeed to look at the screen which is ofcourse dangerous. It does say "Wrong Route" when you go ofcourse but you'd need to hit a button to relculate the route from your current position. All said, for less than $100 this stuff rocks !! 
I found GT Legends to be a very realistic game. Plenty of user controlled variables. Tracks, at least the ones I could get to, were well represented and realistic. While I found the graphics quality good, the overall presentation was somewhat plain. I would have expected a little more "punch" to the visual representation of the tracks. I was quit disappointed with the fact that so few tracks are available at the start. I am a firm believer that if I paid for the whole game I should have access to the whole game no matter what my skill level. This idea of having to find cheat codes to play the whole game is a bunch of bull. Finally, 3 CD'S is a hassle why not a DVD option. 
Ratings relative to other racing games. No doubt if this is your thing you will like this game. It's not an arcade game like GTA or NFS but is intended and seems to succeed as simulation. Several help / assists make it easier for rookies. Extrordinarily difficult on maximum settings, but satisfying if you "dumb down" the competition a bit, otherwise the learning curve and intensity is extreme. On line play available but expect to contend with both obsessed and extremely skilled components as well as crash happy losers. I would consider this the most compelling and perhaps realistic racing simulation around. Fabulous 3D rendering really requires current high end hardware. Using with a MacBook Pro (XP on boot camp) it works really well. Hate to admit of how much time I've spent playing this. Way cheaper than running real race cars and a lot safer. Works great with the Logitech G25. Problems: Missing online code available from manufacturer via e-mail. Starforce copy protection is annoying (requires original disk in drive) but has not caused any problems that I am aware of 
GT Legends is a racing simulation that is based on the FIA GTC and TC leagues. What this means is that you get real world, present day tracks and old school autos to tear around them in. The graphics are very good and the sound is amazingly good on a decent sound system. The trck selection is very good and varied. The same can be said for the car selection. The game is heavy on the realism so if you are a fan of arcade racers it may not be for you. Though there is a career type mode where you have to run short championships to unlock tracks and earn money for new cars a la Gran Turismo. This system has been heavily criticized by sim enthusiasts but it gives the game a sense of purpose and truthfully its a lot of fun as well. If you don't like it you can search GT Legends forums for a fix that unlocks everything without having to do the championships. To play this game a steering wheel is a must. Although you can set it up for the keyboard or a controller neither does the game justice. Any steering wheel will do but I would recommend one with at least a shifter because it just doesn't feel right using panel shifters with these old cars, and frankly its alot of fun pumping the clutch and changing gears. If you have a force feed back wheel then you are in for a treat as it really adds to the game. The multiplayer component is easy to use although there doesn't seem to be alot of activity. Might have somthing to do with time zones as if you visit the GT Legends forums there are plenty of posts about online races. Just have to find a good group to race with I guess. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who really likes racing games 
I am an older guy who can remember these great cars from the 60's and the races they ran. This is a terrific game and great fun. It installed and ran without a hitch (except I had to call the company to get the online code - a real person answered the phone and sent me the code immediately - amazing customer service). I am very pleased with this game and can't believe you can get such a quality game for such a low price 
Outstanding! The copy protection kind of stinks but the software itself is GREAT! Very, very realistic driving experience. On-screen performance matches the true vehicle's performance. Many customizaton options. I did end up downloading a "cheat" to give me more options rather than win them racing 4 cylinder econo-racers but the overall experience is outstanding! I would highly recommend this software to any racing enthusiast 
Seems like the most cost effective way to get Groove and OneNote. I could really have used Visio and Project as part of the package though...the pricing for Project has become frankly insane 
This is a pretty good program for creating partitions; a little difficult to use off the bat, but fairly easy to learn 
It re-partitioned my C drive with no problems when it was almost full with a bad sector or block on the drive. I also had drive I was having difficulty formating but director 10.0 did the job, a must have utility program. There is a learning curve with this program if you want to get into all its aspects but its not very steep. 
I accidentaly deleted a partitiom off my friends computer while repairing it - good job ehh. This program really saved me. Definately something a power user wants in their tool box 
I had gotten tired of paying the continual price increases at Symantec so I searched for another partition maker. Finding Acronis I tried it and liked it. The only drawback that keeps me from giving it a 5 is that the instructions are a bit clunky - not clear in all cases. Other than that, it is an excellent value 
I thought it should also have a single player with levels. The single player mode isn't great but multiplayer is fun for a group of friends that love FRIENDS!! If you are looking to play alone, get the used at a discount. :) *******A True FRIENDS Fan! 
This is perfect for a small business to keep track of virtually everything! From sales taxes to inventory, customers to vendors...you can keep track of it all! It's start up interview makes it so easy to use that anyone can be successful with the set up process 
It is much easier to navigate than 2003 and the Ribbon is excellent. The ohter features speed up the process in Word, Excell and Powerpoint. Way to go Bill Gate 
I BELEIVE THAT FINALLY MICROSOFT FINALLY FOUND THE RIGHT FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS IN A VERY GOOD PACKAGE. CONGRATULATION 
Finally a true upgrade, its GUI has changed, but its for the better. Options are no longer hidden. Once you get comfortable with it, you won't go back. Highly recommended. 
Been using these programs for years. They make the whole process pretty easy. I like owning the program so that I can easily open my electronic tax files in the future and not rely on obtaining access to previous year programs thru web servers 
Don't know how I ever got along doing my taxes before TurboTax came along. I've been using it for years now and will continue as long as they have the program and I have to file taxes 
purchased it for a gift for my brother and got it two days after I ordered it. 
This software isn't actually your excellent version of notation software, but what I mean is this: There is nothing out there that you can get this cheaply that works this well. If you are composing for an orchestra, you will need to pay a few hundred dollars and get the real thing, because Finale SongWriter can't notate for orchestra, but if you are just trying to write down some basic music for your own enjoyment or if you are trying to make your band's music look more official, this is the software for you. As a kid, this is something that I can buy with my own money easily compared to the hundreds of dollars that I would have to save to get the real deal, and this provides about everything I need to write band songs or duets to do with friends. It's easy to use, and it does not require one to study the manual for hours to understand. Even friends of mine who do not know how to read music have had a fair amount of luck creating what they want on it 
*This is an upgrade edition* We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. "Starter" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. "Home Basic" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. "Home Premium" has limited networking interaction. "Vista Business" has the extended networking interaction. "Vista Enterprise" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. "Ultimate" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase. Installing Vista is very easy. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. "Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the "gadgets" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's "widgets" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called "Konfabulator", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures. Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard ("Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?" "Oh yeah, the documents folder!"), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX. Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story. 99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is. XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do. The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again. 
I got this on request as a Christmas gift last year, along with an M-Audio KeyStation 61es keyboard. The combination of the two works really nicely on my PowerMac. I didn't really start going through the lessons until about a week ago due to shoulder surgery I had at the beginning of the year, but so far so good. For the record, I studied music for about 10 years when I was younger, though not piano. While I still remember much of that earlier training (in particular, how to read music) there's plenty new about piano so that I'm not feeling these early lessons to be too easy (though they may be slightly easier). I do have a few complaints about the program. First, as another reviewer noted, you cannot turn down the volume of the accompaniment / instructor. This makes it impossible for me to hear my own playing when going through a lesson, even with the KeyStation's volume cranked all the way up. So what I do is play the instructor audio once to get the idea, then play solo so I can hear all my flubs and faults (and also when I get it right! ;-D). Second, the program seems slightly crash-prone running on Mac OS X 10.4 (a.k.a. "Tiger"). I've found it will crash at least once in any given practice session, and when I re-launch I'm right back where I started for that session. True, I can just click the right arrow until I get to where I left off, but if I'd been going for a half-hour and managed to get through several screens it's a little irritating. Third, though not a bug, is how the music is displayed on screen. As another reviewer noted, the programmers / designers seemed to feel that 640 x 480 was plenty of resolution, but this means that many of the songs you play cover multiple screens. "When the Saints Go Marching in" took up 3 screens, which seemed ridiculous when I'm on a 1280 x 1024 monitor. Yes, the pages auto-turn for you when you to the end of one, but the first time or two through a song it's very irritating as I'm trying to read ahead and figure out what fingers need to move next. But maybe most importantly, I'm finding that this software, while it certainly teaches the fundamentals of playing well enough, still doesn't fully take the place of a real, live instructor sitting there with me. In particular, I can tell that my hand position is not completely right because when I play the fingers in my right hand (especially my ring finger) get sore rather quickly, like I'm straining the muscles/tendons on the top of the fingers. I've got large long-fingered hands, and even with the full-size keys of the KeyStation I find it hard to get all five fingers seated on the keys without at least two fingers curling quite a bit. Maybe this is normal when you start playing piano, but it would be nice to have someone there to confirm whether I'm doing it OK. I'm certain a live instructor would see anything I was doing wrong right away and help me correct it right then and there. Videos showing proper posture are all well and good, but the program can't see me or tell me that I have a posture problem. All it can do is say that I played a wrong note or that I held a note too long / short. I'm hoping that I'm not developing any other problems with my technique, since I do plan on moving to a live instructor at some point when my schedule opens up and I've become certain that I can devote the time to serious practice. I'd hate to develop some decent playing skills only to find I have to start over because my core technique is all wrong. So, five stars because of the generally good quality of the technical instruction, minus one star for not being able to point out purely physical problems with my playing. Not the program's fault, but I can't give five stars to something that can't perfectly replace a live teacher 
I've been using this piano trainer for about 2 months now, and am up to lesson 100 or thereabouts. I've been spending about 1/2 hour each day with it, on an OS X Mac with a MIDI/USB piano keyboard attached to it. Each day, I start at my "tail" lesson, then work through all of the other ones up to my "current" lesson. Then I do the "tail" lesson again. If I can play it with the computer rating me at 99 or 100%, I declare that I've "passed" that lesson, and move the tail up to the next lesson for the next day. If I don't pass, I keep the tail where it is. At the other, "current", end, I usually move up one lesson per day, unless the current one is particularly challenging. I also usually have one "goof off/preview" lesson where I just relax and try to have a little fun with the next lesson beyond the current one, giving myself a little treat to look forward to. I usually take the weekends off, and only do my lessons if I'm feeling like I want to. During weekdays, I find it is a nice way to just do "something different" after a day at the office, and quickly find myself sucked in; the lesson time passes quickly. The system has worked quite well for me so far. I've stayed motivated and am making definite and consistent progress. The program works very well for the most part. Each lesson displays the sheet music, and has a button that plays the lesson as it should sound. Plus, most lessons have video snippets of an instructor giving detailed examples and hints. Most lessons also have a button where you can play accompanied by other instruments. After you play the lesson, the computer rates your performance, from 0 to 100% correct, and shows on the sheet music where you made mistakes (wrong notes, notes played too long or short, etc.). There are a few bugs in the OS X Mac version. The worst is that the sound volume level for the instructor / example music can't be changed. There's a slider for this in the preferences window, but it doesn't work. The volume is stuck at maximum, so it is far, far louder than the sound coming from my own playing. The other serious bug is that the automatic lesson grader almost always indicates that you've played the final note of the lesson too short, even if you hold it down far too long; this seems to be especially true if the final note is a whole note. The other bug I regularly see is that a window will pop up saying something about the script interpreter crashing. This doesn't seem to cause any problems, but it is annoying. Other than that, the program seems solid. It uses a better piano sound than the one that comes built-in on the Mac; it still isn't realistic like the ones on the Casio and Yamaha keyboards, but it's good enough 
This CD had so much useful information, and a great deal of it I had not even considered. Usually I can glean one or two things that I get from a book (CD) that makes it good and useful, this had many things I found useful. It was in a format that was easy to follow and I could skip over the parts that I did not find useful. Some sections were more geared for military personnel or foreign diplomats, but I guess I could use some of the strategies if I was traveling overseas? Some of it was also basic common sense, but if there was ever an emergency, it would be good to have it to refer to just to be sure we did not forget something. I also think some is more useful if we were already attacked as I would not use many of the strategies today. I kept waiting for the part where it would say buy lots of guns and hide cash and gold coins, but there was none of that. Overall, there are so many things in here that I had not thought about, and it was presented without a lot of fluff -- just the facts -- in an organized, easy, and comprehensice manner. I would highly recommend it for the entire family 
I have recently become more serious about web page design. I looked at other products and tried them out. However, Dreamweaver has exceeded my expectations. I am not an advanced user by any means, so my rating might have a "new user bias" to it. My first web site used a WYSIWYG editor similar to Frontpage. Then, I downloaded the 30 day trial of Dreamweaver and redesigned the site. Productivity greatly increased and the interface is very easy to navigate, once you get used to it. The new web site is by far more impressive, user friendly, and feature rich without a cut in productivity. Learning Dreamweaver is a pleasure. If you are familiar with web design, the learning curve is very nice. I was making web pages within a couple of hours of downloading the trial. Tutorials are readily available in the Help menu and on the Adobe web site. Of course, you can always find a good book here on Amazon. If the price of Dreamweaver can fit your budget and you are serious about making impressive web sites, I highly recommend the consideration 
I think that any paranormal investigators that deal with EVP's (Electronic Voice Phenomenon" can agree that this is probably the most important program that you can own. This is used to apply noise reduction, loop, slow-down, normalize, etc. when editing an EVP. Adobe if you are reading this review please oh god please someday release this product for the Mac. A great and certainly very powerful program 
We've been using this program for our business for about a year now. I find it to be easy to use and a good value for the money. We used it to create invoices for our customers, to keep track of our checkbook, to have easy access to the amount of our sales each month, quarter and for the year and more. I would recommend it for small businesses starting out. 
I recently left Corporate America and set up a consulting practice which required balancing my own books instead of relying on the Finance group. I looked over several offerings and decided I only needed to track billings and create invoices. QuickBooks Simple Start handles these tasks quite well in addition to providing useful reports on outstanding invoices, sales by customer and a host of other great cuts at the data. I do agree with other reviewers that expensing of business supplies is not that well done and I couldn't figure out a way to depreciate a computer and software that I bought for the business. On the positive side, it is very simple to use and given the limited transactions avialable pretty much forces you to do it right. Overall I would purchase this product again given it's low cost and ability to meet my basic needs of keeping the books for my small business 
I'd been vacillating between Money Small Business, Quicken Business, and then stumbled across QuickBooks Simple Start. I bought Quickbooks because I expect my small business to grow to need the more advanced versions. The install was simple, the set up equally easy, and using it a breeze. It does just what I needed, with the exception of allowing me to charge by the hour instead of the product (or maybe I haven't figured out how to do that yet... that's what cost it a star. If it can do that, bump this up to a five.) Clean, simple interface, easy to use. Thrilled I bought it, but paid twenty dollars more for it last week than it's listed for now. :( Aw, well. It's tax deductable.. 
My husband and I bought two copies when it was a Gold Box featured product so he could install it on both of our computers. He is a computer consultant and rates ZoneAlarm at 4 stars because, after using it for a few weeks, we find too many spurious alerts for items that ZA should have had on their "safe" list, particularly the "suspicious activities" of the OS Firewall. This program is puzzling for a casual user such as myself to navigate alone. I would still rather have more protection than I can handle, rather than a dummied-down version that I would understand better but that might not provide the virus protection we need, but he says he wouldn't recommend this to his novice clients unless they wanted a lot of hands-on control of their systems. 
I highly recommend the new Microsoft Office. Works very well with Vist 
I find Ad Aware better than SpyBot which gets rec's from all the popular magazines. Why? The interface is more sophisticated. Spybot is not very intuitive and requires more clicks of the mouse to do what you want. Ad Aware is more of a one-click solution. But the worst thing about Spybot is that, during a trial on my client's pc, it would not update. An attempt to update the definitions file would result in a progress bar which stalled midway through. You could leave it there for hours, and the process would never complete. This, on a fully functional broadband internet connection. After that happened, I uninstalled SpyBot, then installed and registered Ad Aware directly from Lavasoft. Lavasoft's baby is a first-rate program that, with the important addition of Ad-Watch which you must register to use, effectively puts an end to spyware. Diego, below, must be confused. There is never a charge to update the program or to download definitions. I used Ad Aware for two years without paying for it (it's free) and only registered to get the Ad Watch program to protect my elderly parents from nasty spyware which had disabled their PCs. I read recently a review of Ad-Aware in PC WORLD. The writer was mentally retarded. He claimed, falsely, that Ad-Aware possessed no real-time spyware blocker. What he was doing was comparing the FREE version of Ad-Aware to the PAY versions of programs like Webroot. Is that fair? No. Nevermind. "Please discontinue my subscription to PC WORLD, because I insist upon intelligent articles, and detested reviews that are influenced by bribery." I think there needs to be a law where anyone who reviews anything should disclose how much they were paid by a certain vendor. In the case of PC WORLD I would estimate a mere $10,000, but that's enough to buy the writer's daughter's braces, isn't it? If you drop $27 on Lavasoft you get the Real-Time spyware blocker which works like a charm. And you can take your copy and share with friends and elderly parents, ho-ho-ho! You will find, however, that the Pop-Up interceptor is overly aggressive and can't be used all the time. It tends to cause problems on certain web sites. I recommend just using the most critical protections. If you're curious, download the free edition directly from lavasoft. Then if you like it, register and get Ad Watch. I think you will like it. The criminal organizations that write and distribute spyware bundled inside their games or utilities should be prosecuted the same as virus writers, because their junk disables or reduces the performance of infected PCs. Spyware is no better than smashing my car windshield with a hammer. Uninfecting a PC potentially costs $100 and up, and requires a few days of down-time. I think this is a law enforcement matter, and that the police should be knocking on the door of the guilty corporations. Executives that made the bad decisions should serve jail-time, same as any vandal who has caused millions of dollars (collectively) of property damage. The reason major players in the PC marketplace are silent on spyware is it's driving lots of new PC purchases. People find their old PC (infected with spyware) isn't as fast as it used to be, and they think the solution is to buy a new one. The real solution is to install and register Ad Aware. But a non-technical person will not know this, and most people are non-technical including many people I care about. I am angry at the way the computer scene is today, and how non-technical people are getting the shaft. 
I bought this as a means to cost-effectively to re-build my system. It installed without any problems. I chose the 'full format' instead of the 'quick format' at the very beginning. Be warned, this takes about an 1.5 hours! The HD is a WD 320 GB 7200 RPM EIDE with 8 MB cache. I wonder if the 'quick install' would have gone quicker? Anyway, after that format, the OS was ready to go in less than 30 minutes. There were a lot of updates (75 or so). And you will manually have to update to IE 7 and WMP 11.0 if that is of interest to you. Oh and don't forget to install the drivers for the MB. I could not get updates until I installed the drivers for the ethernet. I have not tried the Vista update and may hold off for a bit. The form was in the package for the upgrade. For my other machines, XP has been better than their previous OS versions I have used. I don't know what the differences are for the retail version versus this OEM version. This is the full install with a key for authentication. The only difference is the money you will save with this OEM. And I don'y see the major differences between Home and Pro editions. For me Home and Pro seems the same. Early on, I heard Pro was better (or more stable) than Home. I don't think it matters anymore. I docked it one star for the potential security problems and the authentication stuff. All in all, I am pleased with the purchase. And I am a satisfied Amazon customer (and their affiliate Tigerdirect) 
I've been using EazySpeak Spanish for about a week now and find it HIGHLY enjoyable and amusing. I do, however, have to agree with other reviews in that it is not for children. I was a little surprised at the semi-nudity of the characters and how, in one exercise, one bikini-clad female had semi-circles in her chest region to suggest nipples. Also, elsewhere in the program, one is introduced to the Spanish words for beer, rum, brandy, cigarettes, and various types of wine. All of these topics should be off-limits to a 12 year-old, which, the box claims, EazySpeak is suitable for. Overall, the program is fun. However, a parent should know beforehand that there are exercises such as "Help the Thief," which is a numbers game in which you assist a burglar in breaking into a safe. Also, there is an entire exercise dealing with drinks which takes place at a bar. Finally, there are the occasional moments spiced with "adult humor"... one such moment being a man kissing his wife goodnight while in bed, but fantasizing about a cute female at his job. Again, not child-appropriate, but all of this should be left to the discretion of the buyer. 
The average person doesn't usually have the cash on hand to hire an estate attorney at $300+ an hour to put together a will or living will for them. The average person with kids is even less able to afford it but the irony is that they need it the most in order to assure their kids are taken care of and that involves additional intricacies related to trusts, guardianship of the kids and such which makes the whole thing cost even MORE. Now that my custody arrangement has gotten sticky, I'm remarried and have something in the way of assets, I decided to spend a few bucks on my will. Key to that notion is 'a few bucks'. I still didn't have thousands to spend. So, I bought a copy of nolo's Willmaker Plus. If you're like me, when approaching the topic of wills, legalities, living wills and trusts, your gaze kinda glazes over and you realize that it is all very big and very complex and far too big or complex to 'get' without a law degree. This software makes it a no-brainer. It asks you questions and you either fill in information (like someone's name) or answer yes/no to very clear, easy to understand questions. Where free form text is allowed, you get very clear instructions and examples. It also adjusts the questions and forms depending upon what state you live in and what options you selected on previous questions. Most importantly, you don't just go through this experience blindly. It guides you through each step with detailed background information and explanations and offers reference material on each item beyond even what's offered in the instructions. At the end of the process, you know what you filled out and why. At the end of each form, it automatically saves it to a saved library of forms that you have filled out for quick access later and gives you the option to preview, modify or print. The printed copies come complete with signing instructions and notary and/or witness fields. Having all of the contact information for everyone together before hand and a general idea of what needed to go to who, it took me about an hour to create a will (complete with a UTMA), a living will, a temporary guardianship letter for my son and his step dad, a final arrangements declaration and automatically generated letters to my executor and elected health care agent. It is exactly what I needed. It's quick. It's in plain English. It's easy. It's cheap for what you get, which is essentially hours of an attorney's time for a fairly cut and dry task and peace of mind that everything is taken care of. 
I used to have Norton for years. After all it was the industry standard, but after it let many a virus slip on through; I had enough. I knew I would not get McAfee as I have repaired many computers with Mcaffee in the past (working in the computer field.) So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings. I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky. Well two years later I have not looked back. I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out. They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc. After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle. When I had Norton, I would have to email them or be charged $40 for a phone call after their software let a virus in. Talk about nerve. No more, Trend Micro is head and shoulders above the rest 
I work in IT, for a Cable ISP. I used to swear by Norton's products, until 2003. After the 2003 Antivirus, their products have been junk, however with the only other mainstream security software out there pretty much being McAfee (which is wretched, stinking garbage and I've never known anyone who had it to NOT get a virus), I considered it to be the lesser of two evils. At my work we frequently refer people to Trend Micro's Housecall, and the consensus amongst my colleagues seems to be that it does the best job of cleaning up infected systems for those of our customers whose service is suspended due to virus activity. I found that dozens of people were recommending the housecall scan over those of Norton, McAfee, and even the program that our company partners with to provide our free customer security suite. Upon finding out about Trend Micro's 30 day free trial, I decided to give it a shot. I think it's a great program, and is as user friendly as possible for the amount of features it has. It loads quickly and isn't a resource hog. I think it's really cool that you can see the mac ID's of people connected to your wireless network. The bad reviews of this program frustrated me. You can't fault a product for having 'larger updates than Norton'... I'd RATHER have a suite that was releasing more updates that were greater in size than Norton - how novel to find a security suite that does its job! It's not Trend Micro's fault you live in the boonies and use dial up. And I don't think it's fair to give it a 1 rating just because you have a particular type of epilepsy where that is what sets you off... If I am eating at a restaurant, and somebody next to me is wearing perfume that triggers a migraine headache for me (also a recognized medical condition), I don't give the restaurant a bad review. After all, the food was great. The only thing I don't like is that if you are trying to change the licence key for the version you have on a machine, there isn't an apparent way to just change the key... so I took the ten minutes to uninstall and reinstall the program, and then enter in the new key (literally, I think it took less than 10 minutes). Keep in mind kiddies, installing ANY security suite on an infected pc or one that has scores of junk left in the registry from McAfee, Norton (or both - some people think that if you install 2 it "protects you more" - SO NOT TRUE) makes you much more likely to experience problems with the install. I NEVER had problems with uninstalling Norton (on the 5 pc's that I did it on) and installing PC Cillin, even without deleting the registry entries that Norton left behind. And as always with a security suite, It's always best on a fresh install of windows. Overall, it runs quickly updates often and has almost every component you could want out of a suite. I personally think it's the best option out there - but keep in mind, you can get a flu shot but it doesn't guarantee that you're not going to get the flu, it just highly reduces the likelyhood. It's a great program and I think it's cool they give you a specialized area on the website to manage the licences and get access to personalized info based on the products you have. Also - Norton charges 30+ bucks for support. McAfee only has online support. PC Cillin is free (not that I've ever had to call since I've never had a problem with the program). P.S.: For the person who reviewed in broken english that they couldn't log into yahoo mail, ten bucks says your security and privacy settings in IE (only someone who uses yahoo mail would use internet explorer) are probably set at "high" and that's why you can't log in 
So, the interface for the new version of Internet Security is very nice and is very easy to use. I have used the previous version in the past upon the recommendation from CNET as the one of the best internet security suites available. I have not been disappointed. The software was very easy to setup and start up and seems to be very secure with regular updates and scans. Fortunately, I have a prety isolated network so I don't worry too much about virus contamination but I do want to monitor my network's usage - especially since I have a wirless system. The software allows me to monitor such activity easily and alerts me to anyone trying to get on without permission. The one time I did have a virus, the realtime scan function caught it before it could embed itself into my system and deleted the malicious code immediately. I haven't seen too much activity overall from the sentry software which is a good thing (I think) and attests to the overall functionality of the software (I think). Either this is a great piece of programming or my computer has been taken over by spyware gangsters in Russia and I'm none the wiser. I hope this help 
It seemed like it took forever to install this software. After properly uninstalling my previous software (norton) and all of its registry enteries, I began installation. My initial problem was that as I own 3 computers, and was running PC-Cillin one one of them, I had problems registering this software....even though this has its own serial number. It is rather amusing that as I purchased a multi pack...the registration process makes no allowance for those of us which own multiple computers. As of 2 days later I am still waiting for a fix. The rest of the installation was easy...it tiresome ( I live in a rural area and have to use dial-up). All was a smooth install except for the lack of error message, when line noise dropped connection (I did not figure this out until after I had performed my first scan and was informed I did not have the most recent version of anti-virals). Decent GUI interface, but clunky. I would rather the development money goes into the software anyway. IF you are a new user it might be more confusing...but the quick start guide is reasonably set out...once you figure out that the order on the quickstart guide is different than the order on the program interface. I am reminded of what Norton used to be like before it sold out to marketing companies/spyware/greyware providers without telling us consumers. I would recommned this to anyone. My only caution is to READ THE DIRECTIONS before jumping into the install. But shouldn't even experienced users do that? I just wish the quickstart guide checklist was in the same order as on the interface. I am confident because of my past experience that I can get the registration problem fixed...when someone who is a native english speaker reads my email to customer service. Dont bother calling the phone number, by the accents of the staff it just goes to a call center outside of the USA (probably in India) 
Great product! Does everything I expected and more. I have been using this product on my home computer for over a year and knew that my office computer needed to be upgraded to this version. 
For me the upgrade was a great thing. There had always been things about Office XP that just didn't work right. After the software was loaded, indeed I had some configuration issues. It worked, but it wasn't slick. But Microsoft Help stepped in. The software support guy took control of my computer using net-meeting and looked at all the configuration issues. Turned out to be some conflicts with my virus protection (I've had these before, P.N.) and with some Microsoft add-ins. Point is, he made the conflicts go away. Microsoft "help" has been a sometime thing, in the past. Today, it rose to the top shelf. I am quite happy with Office 2003. 
Good product but when are they going to fix the screen that says you have not UPGRADED ! ! ! ! It drives me nutz to have that pop up every time I go to Quicken online. I have written as I'm sure others have but still it is there with no way to remove it even after "registering" my upgrade. Quicken is easy to learn, easy to use, maybe not so easy to import and export data as it is very propriatary but still and all I love it online for portfolio views and data at a glance. 
We were using 2003 version and decided it was time to upgrade and I think it was worthwhile; all the reports and features are fresh and clean 
When I slammed the Canon PIXMA 4300 for being terrible, I indicated that I only write reviews when the product is very good, or very bad. In this case, this product is truly amazing. In fact, it is the coolest software I have ever owned or used. In fact, I'd say this is the coolest thing I have ever owned, but that would make me a geek. Buy it without reservation! Running on a MacBook Pro with 2GB RAM and OS X. I suspect the 2GB is a very good idea though I have never tried it with les 
Before I write my review, I would like to note that I have had one semester of Mandarin Chinese, so I am familiar with some of the most basic words and phrases. I am using Rosetta Stone in addition to my Chinese classes so that I will learn to speak better and be able to listen to Chinese on a regular basis outside of class. I read the User's Guide before -- and while -- using Rosetta Stone. The program is not 100% user-friendly, so I needed the User's Guide to find out how to get started in the program, how to put the program in test mode, how to view my test scores, etc. It is very easy after you read the user's guide and play around with the program for a little while to figure everything out. You can select "preview" to see and hear what you will be learning, "guided exercise" to be taken through the lesson automatically, or go through the numbered exercises one by one. With most exercises, you hear a description and/or see a photograph, and you have to match up the description and/or photo with one of four answer choices. Depending on the exercise you do, you will have to recognize characters, spoken words, or both. There are three options for reading and writing text: Pinyin, simplified, and traditional characters. These are on the lower right of the screen. I am using traditional characters in my classes, so I always select the traditional characters option. There seems to be a lot of confusion among reviewers about the writing section. On my CD, there are four different types of exercises you can do in writing: Two exercises allow for pinyin only and the other two allow for pinyin, simplified, or traditional characters. Traditional and simplified characters can be entered into a text box using the drag-and-drop method. If you use pinyin in writing, you have to make rather awkward tone mark selections and get them over the right letter or your answer is wrong. Although some people would claim pinyin is easier than characters, in Rosetta Stone it is infinitely easier to memorize characters due to the constant repetition of phrases than it is to remember where the tone marks go in pinyin. The Curriculum Text so far is of no use to me at all, and appears to be in pinyin and simplified characters only (which is no good for someone trying to learn traditional characters). You don't even really need it to proceed with the lessons, anyway. The speaking portion is not working out entirely well for me, personally. You need a USB headset to record your voice in order to compare it to the native speaker's. I have to speak at an unnaturally-loud level to record anything at all, and I have to speak with constant force in my voice or the program stops recording me. I never get my reply to match the intensity of the speaker's, even with the microphone directly in front of my mouth and me speaking very loudly into it (just below shouting level). This could be my problem, though. Although I don't ever match the speaker's voice, it is good for practice to be able to hear the comparisons between my pronunciation and the speaker's. I haven't needed to use customer support for anything so I can't comment on that and installation was easy. I would describe my first semester of Chinese as intensely challenging and probably the hardest class I have ever taken in my life. Like I said in the beginning, I am using Rosetta Stone to help me build on what I have learned already, and it has been great so far in that respect 
I've used TurboTax for 3 years now! And again this year the software is the easiest way ever to do your taxes. Now I don't dread waiting till the last minute. I love to see the "Federal Tax Due" box get smaller and smaller. It is easy to download - no problems like some software. If you have the time to work on your own taxes then I suggest this program. Need help with a question - you can use the help box, get live help... 
Big plus is fact that this is a 3-user product. I have a PC in 2 diff cities as well as a lap-top so it suits me perfectly. also can be set to do checks automatically based on my schedule 
Adobe comes out and delivers another fine Acrobat product. While I purchased this for the sole purpose of creating PDFs and forms we could email our customers, have them fill out, save and email back, the brief touches I've had with the automatic form generators have left me impressed. The user interface is well thought out and clean which is a touchy subject for me personally as a programmer who specializes in UI design. Everything is movable, hide-able and customizable in a new sharp looking set of toolbars that should feel right at home in Windows Vista. But, while it's a fine product that loads quickly thanks to a pre-loader when Windows starts, it does suffer from it's share of problems. The new user interface, while fancy, is glitchy, and has crashed out the software on more than one occasion. Simple innocuous tasks such as dragging a form element into alignment can suddenly leave you staring dumbfounded at your desktop as Windows defends itself from some index out of bounds fault. Is it entirely stable? No, but sadly, it's up to par with 99% of the industry's X.0 release software standards; which means it's 98% usable, but don't hand your boss an unpadded deadline that doesn't take into account a few crashes here and there. Finally, yes, while the price of RAM continues to decrease, the memory (and hard disk) footprint of software continues to increase to obscene levels. Make sure your office equipment is on the more modern side because it'll take up 20meg+ of your RAM just when the computer starts; which is in this IT professional's opinion, a hefty price to pay just to look at PDFs in my web browser or on my hard drive without a 20 second load-up delay. Load it up and create a PDF of a simple Word 2003 document that contains only a page of text, and task manager tells you it's now eating up 50 meg. In short, it won't run well on the bargain-basement Intel Celeron, 256meg Windows XP machine. As a final note for those who aren't heavily into IT looking to buy this product for their small office, you need to be connected to the internet when this is installed and be absolutely sure you install it on the computer it's going to permanently reside on. Like most expensive modern business software, Acrobat requires an activation in the name of Digital Rights Management that records it's serial number and the hardware ID of the computer it's installed on and keeps it on file at Adobe. One copy of the software will let you install it on exactly one machine. Try to install it on another machine (even if the original machine got obsoleted, kicked the bucket or transferred to different personnel), and you'll be met with a "this is already installed, please buy another copy" message. DRM forces forethought in these modern times. Overall, it's excellent software, and for the faults I listed, I still give it 4 stars because it's an extremely solid product that'll work hard for you. Expect the crashing issues to clear up as Adobe silently releases 8.0.1 and onward as free patches that will be downloaded automatically thanks to Adobe's built-in upgrade manager. While executives balked at the idea of office personnel with 1 gig of RAM in a common desktops a year ago, in reality, that's the working minimum these days for your office's power users who may have eight things open and/or running at once. It's a $50 upgrade that to a power user, saves about 5 minutes of worktime on every hour of computer use. Do the math and get them the tools they need because software like this won't be getting less bloated anytime soon. Finally, if all you're looking at is to create PDF files, there are many smaller, cheaper programs out there that can easily do the task. You might want to hit up Google and investigate further. 
The entire set of lessons arrived in excellent condition and a lot sooner than I expected 
I agree with other reviewers. This software should be combined with other lessons. It was very helpful, and I would recommend it 
This review might be alittle hard on the product but I wasnt impressed. Expecting something revolutionary instead the lessons were kind of like going though High School again with one big exception. They dont give you a writen translation of what every thing means. Rossetta Stone focuses on pictures and the actual sounding out of words spoken. In the program you are presented a picture and in Italian a narrator tells you what is going on or what the picture is. However what he is saying is not directly translated in written words. Its up to you to figure out what he is saying based on what you see in the pictures. So pretty much you are not sure at times which words spoken are verbs or nouns. They do their best to single out the verbs in which they give you multiple pictures of ppl performing the same actions. However still its up to you to figure that out. Other than that its a great program. It forces you to pronounce italian with an italian accent using the pictures you see. You are able to write italian sentences using the same technique (still no english translation). I chose a language I already knew to try the program out. If I was a true beginner...I might have a hard time learning this language and I would by far not be fluent in it. Thats for sure 
I chose Premier having used Deluxe in the past. Gave me a more indepth interview process in considering deductions and investment issues. Probably more than I needed, but I think it is appropriate for those with more investments than me. While it takes longer I enjoy visiting all the subjects. It is very informative 
The product works very good, Microsoft should make their operating systems work as well as this product 
I thought the upgrade went smoothly and I like the improvements very muc 
We tried to just dive in and do our dream house, but it takes a little more time to get into it. But, once you do the tutorial, you can do almost anything. I bought the product so we could see what our dream home would take. We are almost too amateur for it. We probably didn't need to spend this much to be pleased, but it's worked great for us. 
I purchased this to give to my mom for Mother's Day last year. She's in the process of trying to figure out what to do with her backyard and I figured this would be an ideal tool for her to use in order to get a preview of her backyard. She's fiddled around with it some, but has yet to upload photos of her backyard and really start messing around with it, but I suspect she'll get into it in due time 
Not for the professional but gets the job done for the most part 
well when i first got this game, i didn't know what to do. but there is something called the tutorial where it helps you play the game. this really helped me.so when you get to the options menu, click on scenario and click on tutorial.and once you take care of 10 bunnies you go on to cats then you go on to something else.this game is a little confusing but fun 
Good news: BitDefender found a dormant worm in a deleted email on our PCs that Norton Internet Security (NIS) 2007 missed. Also, BD has very little impact on our systems or applications speed, which is why we uninstalled NIS - we had 8 months left on the Norton 3-PC license but our two older PCs (4 5 yrs old) had slowed down due to NIS so much that they were practically unusable. The hourly BD updates are almost unnoticable. Bad news: when we installed BD on the 2nd PC (2-PCs for 2-yrs license), we made the mistake of using my spouse's email and passwd instead of mine, which we had used on the 1st PC. Bad move. It had trouble starting, and modules were erratically turning on and off. We logged into the BitDefender site and found that the same exact license was registered to two different accounts. We uninstalled it, and reinstalled it using my email and passwd as a 2nd key, and that showed up on my account OK. However, there was no way to delete my spouse's account or key on their website. Her copy still ran funky, but at least it started. We used the online chat support and they were friendly and asked that we download two tools from their website and provide them sysinfo dumps by email. We did the dumps and sent them as a reply to their follow-up email with the BD trouble ticket # in the Subject. No reply after 3 days. We sent two other queries, one with the ticket # and one without, both explaining that we needed her bad account and key deleted, as there was probably some server license issues going on that were hindering the operation on her PC. Again, no response. We wound up uninstalling her 2nd copy of my package, and buying a 2nd 2-PC for 2-yrs package. At least those packages via Amazon were about $15 cheaper than a 1-PC for 1-yr CD version directly from SoftWin (BitDefender), so even with the dual CD purchase it is working out to only $16 per yr per PC (NIS was $35/yr/PC). Since we installed her 2nd package using a different email and passwd, and an alias for her name, there doesn't seem to be any key conflicts causing her BitDefender to run whacky. Sorry for the long-winded comments, but we wanted you to know that if everything goes great, the product is fast, low-resource impact, and finds stuff Norton misses. BUT (big but), if you got a problem, you're on your own, pal! Tech support is zip, nada, zed, zero. Thankyouverymuch 
I've had all the major antivirus programs at one time or another. BitDefender installed easily and I don't believe it's slowed down my computer any more than any of the other programs I've used in the past. It found a virus on my first scan after installating the program. 
I purchased a new computer and wanted the best. After some homework I decided on BitDefender. It has worked flawlessly ever since. Even the spy detector has worked great. I ran spybot after each scan and come up with nothing each time. 
When I first began downloading this program I did not know how I should install it or how much memory it used. I phoned tech support and picked this poor young man's brains. He answered every question I asked patiently and politely. He even walked me through some basic tools in the program. I am impressed! The software has hundreds upon hundreds of pre-made scrapbook pages for photos to be inserted, a heap of quality graphics, and these cute balloons you can add text to!! This is so easy to use that after 1 hour of playing with this I had printed half a dozen scrapbook pages! PEOPLE.....THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT!!! 
I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He was so excited about it that he left his other gifts in order to try it. 
NERO 7 Ultra Edition is an extremely comprehensive suite of software. Unfortunately, most of the applications contained within are more than most people (including myself) will ever need. Perhaps, this suite should be broken into three or four different products and sold seperately. For example, they could easily sell a DVD authoring product, a CD authoring product, a back-up ultility and music/MP3 software. Pros: When you figure out how to work the individual components of this suite (see cons), they work well and seamlessly. I like its ability to combine VOB files into one file and then export it into a variety of different formats using Nero Vision. Nero Recode works well if you have burned home movies onto a DVD+R DL disc and need to switch it onto a single-layer disc for family members who do not have DL technology. The utility for burning data CDs or DVDs (the classic Nero Burning ROM)is quick and painless. I don't use the other applications much, but you have to be careful that Nero doesn't make itself the default player for all types of media. Cons: The website is poor and the instructions are difficult to follow if you can find them. The FAQ section is out of date and doesn't address the major questions that I had when trying to figure this software out (possible it is a language issue). There are not even user forums to discuss problems with the software like many other companies offer. The software update utility did not work for me and I was unable to use it for months and therefore was unable to fix a bug that occasionally lead to a fatal Windows XP error. If you can update to the newest version (instructions to follow), things work better. I never had any compatability problems with my drives that I have seen a lot of people complain about. Fixes: If you are unable to update the software usning the update utility, the following worked for me: 1) Download the latest upgrade from [...] 2) Using control panel (add and remove programs), remove Nero from your computer. 3) Install the new upgrade from your hard drive. The installation program will detect your valid software serial number and install the new version of Nero 7 Ultra. Be careful that Nero doesn't make itself the default player for all media files during installation. 4) The new update utility works 1000x better than the old one and there should not be any problems. The new version of Nero 7 Ultra is far superior to the original version as well. Of course, the instruction on the web site do not tell you that you have to uninstall the old version before installing the new version. It took a long time and a lot of frustration to figure it out. Overall: 1) The software worked very well for me. It worked faster than other applications that I tried. 2) The web site is bad, at best. The documentation is bad, at best. The update utility included with this suite is non-functional, but the upgrade works very well. 3) I give this high marks on the software performance, but subtract for simply too many applications included and for the horrible customer support and bad web site. 4) Since I value functionality over customer support, I give this 4 stars (I would give 3.5, but that is not an option) 
We purchased Nero in order to make voice recordings for other people. The program has worked great. It does what it says, it allows wonderful editing, so you can make sure what you record is clean. We have also used it to record old cassettee tapes to CD. The program automatically records the track making it an easy and smooth process. We have been extremely happy with the low tech aspect, as we are not techy people. Easy to use. Does what it says it will do and a little more 
I interviewed for a job and notice the office was Mac dominated. I had always been reluctant to go with a mac so once I got offered the job I ordered this dvd to as to not be a total Mac dumb-donkey. I watched the first few lessons and I was set, my first day of work went well thanks to the DVD. The quality is the best and Tod the presenter is a gifted teacher, good voice, excellent overall. thanks To 
I bought this about 6 months ago when I bought my first mac and also my first computer.I don't know why they aren't selling more of these things .For me ,looking at a manual the size of a phonebook is about as interesting as stocking shelves in a supermarket.This DVD rom is 8 hours long and covers all the items in the contents very well.Perhaps with a manual you can get into more detail but for me this is the place to start at least.What I do is watch a section and then either take a few notes and go to a particular program or just go to a particular program itself.By the way I do own a couple of manuals for Appleworks but they just collect dust 
I really like the '07 version...now that I have gotten used to the infamous menu ribbon. At first it seemed like nothing was where it used to be (it's not!) and I had to hunt for everything, but now that I have been using it for a few days I believe this version is a great improvement over past Office suites. There is also the free PDF plug-in, that I have used many times already, that has you thinking what took Microsoft so long. There are many more great points as well, such as font preview which allows you to see what your text will look like just by hovering over the font name in the drop down menu, also an improved right-click short-cut menu. Outlook now has your calendar and to-do list on the right side of the screen and the ability to categorize things using color codes. Excel has a great new sort feature. My only complaint would be that Outlook does seem a bit slower now, but the benefits far outweigh the bad. Now if I could just convince my technology shy co-workers of this 
I THINK 07 IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER 03. I AM NOT AN OFFICE GEEK, BUT NEED TO USE THE PROGRAM TO ACCOMPLISH MY WORK. IT IS EASIER TO GET THE JOB DONE WITH THIS NEW VERSION. INTUITIVE THOUGHT PROCESSES WORK WITH IT. I LIKE IT AND AM HAPPY WITH IT 
This version of WP is as good as its predecessors, and the conversion programs are better. Make it your default app for Word docs. There is only one problem I have come across so far. If you set Select mode to WP 9, it is still buggy; it takes some effort to select the text you want. You can always set the mode to the earlier version. 
I have always liked WordPerfect better than word. My edition was getting old so I picked up this new one. It is a bit different but easy to navigate and has some great updates. I would recommend it for anyone needing lots or word processing 
I have been very pleased with Wordperfect X3. I have always thought that Microsoft Word was over-rated. I would recommend Wordperfect X3 to anyone that is looking for an alternative to Word 
I recently had a water problem that leaked on to my dining room ceiling. Knowing I would have to replace the ceiling, I took the opportunity to do some remodeling. I purchased the Punch Interior product. At first it was a little overwhelming, but after thumbing through the manual and reading some information on the Punch website I was able to quickly layout the the area of my room with the room designer. I was able to use the designers pallet to select the colors that I wanted to use and place on the walls. Even cooler than that I was able to select Sherwin-Williams paint. I walked right into the local store and matched the paint. It couldn't get much easier than that. There are also tutorials that you click on from the help menu that guide you in placing the materials. I was able to add some digital photos of some artwork as well on the wall. This has opened eyes to many other projects in my home. With a little effort the program is easily manueverable, but if you get stuck there are many ways to get through to the finished product. 
I resisted upgrading my 2004 version, especially after reading the reviews here. But the R4 release upgraded all by business, bank, and investment accounts without any problems. For business, the accountants would rather you use Quickbooks, but since mine is a simple service based business, I still refuse. Quicken works just fine and having everything in one place is just too valuable. It looks largely the same as 2004. But I was impressed by the online improvements, which is why the 2004 version is not longer supported. Now, it will automatically rename things the way you like. Since this eases the biggest problem of using software like Quicken, namely the discipline to enter and label everything, it a huge benefit. If you are looking to get control over your cashflow, and see the forest through the trees, this is the program. Learn it, know it, live it 
I have been using Quicken since 2000 for my family accounting and my LLC biz accounting also. I updated my Quicken from ver2004 to ver2007. Costco had a much better price than Amazon for this software. The update process went smoothly. The ver2007 has a lot more reporting capabilities than the ver2004. The on-line update seems to be either on-the-par or a little slower than the ver2004. I tried the MS money deluxe back in mid -2006, but I just don't like the interface design from MS Money. So far, 2 months after the updating, I haven't run into any problem. Overall, I am happy with the ver2007 Quicken. 
Following the tutorials, I was able to teach myself how to use the Quickbooks program. It took me about five hours to figure it out and enter all my data. Now I'm more organized, which in effect has increased my business performance. I also like the financial reports that the program generates. 
Nice features, much easier to see all customer or vendor information at a glance. No longer have to go to different screens to see contact information and ledger histories. Time savings for this alone are worth upgrading 
I know that most people simply do not backup their systems. If they only knew how easy it was with a product like Norton Ghost. This product not only backs up your files, it actually takes a snapshot of your system. If your hard drive fails completely, you can boot off the CD and clone a new drive to the state it was when the last backup was done (actually called a recovery point). Trust me, it works. I have had a hard drive fail on me. Another great feature is that you can also easily restore individual files from a specific recovery point. Having previously used Norton Ghost 9.0 for backup, I was already a big fan. But, version 10.0 is well worth the upgrade. Improvements include having Norton Ghost manage the space used for backups, so you don't have to guess how many recovery points will fit on your backup drive. And the biggest improvement of all - you can mount a recovery point as a mapped drive and copy files from previous backups, just like it was any other mapped drive. I have not used the backup to CR-RW or DVD-RW, although the product supports it. I would highly recommend getting an extra internal hard drive or external USB hard drive dedicated for backup with Norton Ghost. I use this method and it works great 
I bought this item for my grandson - it seemed fun to practice multiplication, etc. He actually did not want to even look at it, but absolutely loved it, after playing just once. It seems to be geared to children's minds and I think it is a clever way to get children to practice math. I can only recommend it 
Once you decrypt the game entry point, Math Blaster is a brilliant method for teaching basic math functions (+,-,*, /). The problem with startup is the lack of guidance on how to start the game. A line or two (in the UI)explaining how to start the game (after the arithmetic tables are displayed) would be a tremendous assistance for beginners. We were disappointed with the list of +,-.*,/ tables displayed until we accidently clicked the entry point with the mouse. The user is presented an endless set of arithmetic expressions which the user must discern as valid/invalid while exploring a labyrinth of shoot-em-up and donkey-kong type choices. Perfect for a 6 year old 1st grade student 
A fun and excellent way to learn math. Great program for children with learning differences 
I found this to be a very good teaching tool to learn to play rock style music. I have never played the guitar before only the violin for eight years while in school. Now I am in my thirties and thought it would be too difficult to learn to play. I have been through the first four lessons and so far it is great. I can work at my own pace, repeat sections I find difficult and play actual songs with lyrics. It is great to play real music not just practice the chords and riffs (although practice is required, it is just more fun). Great piece of sofware. I combined this with a couple of books to study when not at the computer and this worked great for me. Great job eMedia. I look forwrard to additional eMedia song books for rock music 
Again, Rainbow Bibles are a little difficult to find but my husband was very pleased with the quality and Amazon came through for me again. 
The NIV Rainbow Study Bible is an excellent product. I must congratulate the author and his support team for such a wonderful and thorough job. I received this gift from my boss eleven years ago and still I am and will always be an avid reader/student of the Bible. It has been such a helpful tool in understanding the Bible that I have been giving it to my friends and family. I use the maps, diagrams, subject guide, concordance, and the analysis at the beginning of each book. Most of all I just love the color coding with the different subjects like, Faith, Family, God etc; this makes study interesting and gives a "hands-on" insight into the inspired Word of God. This NIV version is reader-friendly in a language that is easy to understand and follow along, as against the earlier versions, which made comprehension a bit challenging for me. During my study I also compare NIV's contents and interpretations against another version and so far no content has been lost through the interpretation. My one desire is have it in a smaller size so that I can carry it around wherever I go! I would defintely recommend this product. 
I found many improvements in overall manageability, but some have taken time to get used to. The application window that opens for some filters is too much for me. I do love the ease with which I can move from Photoshop to Painter as I use both. Since Photography is my main reason for Photoshop, Bridge is great for working with RAW (once I figured it out), but as a browser for finding images I had to learn to adjust to it. The old browser was simpler to use. Sometimes I do not want it around in the background, and now I just close it out. For me Bridge was the biggest new addition. I like the rename feature, metadata, file info window, RAW adjustment. The rest of Photoshop was a natural upgrade and was easy to move into. 
It's not that Photoshop is so great at what it does, really. It's that everyone else's programs are so far behind it. Every release gets a little better. Even the cheaper Photoshop Elements release has the new Shadow/Highlight tool and several of the other great Photoshop feaures. I'd love to buy a photo editing program by someone else. There are plenty of things about Photoshop that occasionally annoy me. Color correction can be some kind of voodoo ritual, for instance. There's just nothing else out there worth considering as a replacement, though. So, uh...I guess I'm a loyal Adobe customer. 
Everyman's Photoshop CS2 Review The reason this is called an "everyman's" review is that I'm less than an expert. In fact, if Photoshop were a car, I'd be the one driving it cross-country in first gear. I normally use Photoshop for creating Web graphics or sexing up photos - no shifting required, in other words. But Photoshop does way more than that, so much so that without it, most designers would curl up and die. For most of us though, running a full-bore image-editing app is like driving a Ferrari in the back yard. I ought to know: I've had access to the software for a long time and still don't know what all the tools are for - the latest version, Adobe Photoshop CS2, has even more. That said, if you have any kind of visual project in mind and a modicum of talent, there's hardly anything you can't do. It may take a while to get rolling, but once you do, you'll kill for a chance to have your very own copy. See what you can do? Photoshop CS2 is available alone or as part of the Adobe Creative Suite 2, which includes Adobe Illustrator CS2, Adobe InDesign CS2, Version Cue CS2, Adobe GoLive CS2, and Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Professional in the Premium Edition. (This reviewer was slated to receive the full suite, but "only" the Photoshop component showed up. Color me stupendously grateful regardless, of course, but I won't be addressing the integration features in this review.) At $599 for the standalone version, piracy has always been a problem for Adobe, but the company has gone out of its way to save you from yourself by requiring activation -- not the same thing as registration -- within 30 days of installation. In the past, you could buy the app and install it on all your computers (or any machine for that matter), but the new version only works on the user's primary and secondary computers. Frankly, the details of the activation process left me confused. According to Adobe's activation FAQ page (my emphasis): The activation process supports installation on two machines. The Adobe product license agreement allows the primary user to install the product on a primary computer and also on a home or laptop computer for his or her use, provided that the two copies are not used simultaneously. While the activation process supports installing and activating Adobe software on two machines, the usage of the product on the second computer is restricted to the user who licensed the software. Allowing others to use a second copy of the software violates the product license agreement. Call me dense, but I have no idea what they mean by not using both copies simultaneously. Shortly before submitting this review, I had Photoshop CS2 running on both of my computers and nothing blew up, nor did anyone unpleasant bust down my door. And apparently my wife isn't allowed to use the software on the TiBook, according to the above. Frankly, this is absurd, and I wish the company's lawyers would get a life. But be that as it may, the installation process itself was straightforward, although my 500 MHz TiBook with OS X 10.3 (an oldie but a goodie) required a few hard slaps on the case above the CD-ROM drive before the disk would mount. And the first thing I learned when launching the new app was that as usual, I was coloring outside the lines: Mac OS X version 10.3.4 or later is recommended for maximum performance and correct operation of Adobe Photoshop CS2. An earlier version of Mac OS X was detected. Oops! Despite the warning, the official system requirements listed in the reviewer's guide only call for a minimum of Mac OS X version 10.2.8, and I haven't seen any signs of "incorrect" operation yet. True, installing Photoshop on my 400 MHz Blue White G3 with OS X 10.3 seems to have magically doubled the boot time, but that's it. If you don't have 10.3.4, I'd say go for it anyway. For those of you with older versions, there are more than enough useful new features in Photoshop CS2 to justify the $149.99 upgrade cost. A partial rundown includes the following, a few of which I'll expand upon later: * Adobe Bridge (the File Browser on steroids) * Vanishing Point (an extraordinary plane-based visual perspective tool) * Image Warp (turns flat images into shaped graphics) * Reduce Noise filter (corrects JPEG compression artifacts and more) * 32-bit High Dynamic Range (HDR) editing (creates images with the "widest possible dynamic range") * Spot Healing Brush (one-click retouching) * One-Click Red Eye tool * Optical Lens Correction * Animation (create animated GIFs directly in Photoshop) * Smart Sharpen * Enhanced 16-bit Filter Support * Smart Objects (allow non-destructive scaling, rotation and warping of layers within Photoshop CS2) * Multiple Layer Control (select, align, group and simultaneously move multiple layers) * Multi-Image Camera Raw (um...) * Video Preview (preview your work on a FireWire-connected monitor) * WYSIWYG Font Menu (you're gonna love this) * more color management options when printing * all-new PDF engine (automatic optimization for Web viewing) * High Capacity RAM Compatibility (can address 3.5 GB on a G5) * expanded, integrated online services See what I mean? As for Adobe Bridge, I probably shouldn't comment, since I've never used the old File Browser [blush]. But here's what Adobe has to say: The acclaimed File Browser has evolved into its own application - Adobe Bridge. Now, the two applications work efficiently in parallel - Adobe Bridge building thumbnails while you edit in Photoshop CS2, or Photoshop CS2 batch processing images while you continue to work in Adobe Bridge. Adding essential new features for photographers such as multiple-file Camera Raw processing, enhanced ranking and labeling, and a slideshow mode for quick review of your images, Adobe Bridge also integrates with Illustrator CS2, InDesign CS2 and GoLive CS2, bridging the workflow across the new Creative Suite 2 applications. I don't know about File Browser, but Bridge rocks, and I'm converted. Instead of locating a particular image in the Finder using column view, in Bridge I can browse any folder on my hard drive, see all the photos at once (Filmstrip View, below, is a hoot), and open any or all of them in Photoshop with just a click. Just five minutes of playing with this opened my eyes, and when a skeptic like me gets all mushy, people should pay attention. The Vanishing Point filter, completely new to CS2, rates a whole review all by itself. As Adobe explains it, "First you define the perspective in your image by creating perspective grids, then you edit your image normally, and let Vanishing Point take care of adjusting your editing to the defined perspective." What that means in real terms is that you can do things you never dreamed of without doing hours of work, like pasting "WAY COOL" and "YOW!" into the image below. (How did I do the "Hah!"? Keep reading...) Talk about serious empowerment! I've never even tried to do work on this level, but now I can. Once you've defined the planes (grids) in your image, you can drag objects into the distance and have them still be in correct perspective. And since the perspective grids are saved inside the image (or on a separate layer if you want), you can return to re-edit whatever's been placed in them. Edit in perspective? Yup. You can paint directly onto perspective planes with the Stamp Tool, make selections within them, and a whole lot more. This is one extraordinary feature. Add Image Warp to the mix, and your inner package designer will wake up hollering. Adobe has thoughtfully included a full set of presets for common object shapes, and you can drag control points on the warp grid to customize as desired. Ever wonder how your logo would look on a coffee mug or baseball cap? Image Warp has it covered. This is what I used to place the "Hah!" text inside the Mexican pot, of course, and remember, I don't know what I'm doing - so power users ought to be able to effect miracles. * * * There's a lot more to talk about, but we only have one Web site, and I'm sure my MyMac colleagues will have more to say about Photoshop and the other CS2 applications. Meanwhile, my other picks for things to be thankful for in the CS2 version are the ability to make animated GIFs right inside Photoshop, the Spot Healing Brush for removing unwanted pixels with a single click, multiple layer control, and the WYSIWYG Font Menu. Those of you who import vector graphics from Illustrator ( I don't ) will be able to start a whole new religion with Smart Objects, and photographers will love the new Camera Raw format editing power. This is an incredibly powerful and versatile application. If I were Santa Claus or a benevolent deity, I'd make sure every artist and designer with half an ounce of talent had a copy to carry him- or herself to the Promised Land. It really is that good, although I have to say the complexity is overwhelming for beginners. (The Adobe Help application is the best I've ever seen, however, and provided tremendous assistance in writing this review.) I'd have no hesitation whatsoever in giving Photoshop CS2 the highest possible rating, except for an intuition that the app has grown to the point where its sheer size and multitude of features, not to mention the price, are bound to limit expansion of the user base. Personally, I'd like to take a digital carving knife to Photoshop and create about half a dozen specialty image editing apps, but that's not the direction Adobe is going, especially after absorbing Macromedia, and who's to say I know better than them? I also have no love for the increasingly maddening anti-piracy and copy protection measures employed by the industry, although Adobe's activation process gave me no trouble. It's the principle of the thing, and I'm just old-fashioned when it comes to trusting people. But if you can get yourself a copy (legally!), this is the one to have, hands down. That's why hesitation aside, there isn't even a contest. I love it, and it's already indispensable, even for a first-gear user. MyMac.com Rating: 5 out of 
Mappoint is a great product but I don't understand why there aren't more city maps for Mexico included. This product is supposed to be for North America, to which Mexico belongs. Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and Mexico City were improved this time but it is very disappointing that the other major cities are still just shown as crossroads 
I like this product and will buy it again. It is easy to use and understand 
For the price, this is a great substitute for OFFICE. Good, Capable, Easy. I haven't needed anymore, (using as a "home-based" product) 
Microsoft Works 7.0 is a simple easy to use program. It is all that I need for home use on the computer that it is on. 
Microsoft Works sometimes gets a bad rap. If you never used it, you may not know that includes a database, spreadsheet, word processor, and more. What's even better, is that the spreadsheet and word processor are compatible with Microsoft Office. So you can save files so that they can be opened in Microsoft Office AND you can open files that someone else sent to you if they were created in MS Word or Excel. This is perfect for the work I do for the humane society that I volunteer for as well as planning my daughter's girl scout troops activities and camping trips 
This game is the best! I didn't know how to play it at first and then my friends bought it and helped me! One night I couldn't get myself of the computer! Great game! Don't listen to the reviews that say this game is bad! It is well worth the money.. 
My daughter(6) loves the game and is able to interact with it without my assistance. She is involved with horses on a regular basis in her everyday life so for a horse related game to keep her attention is quite an accomplishment 
I have been a Symantec customer for many years. Each year this product gets better and better. Has Norton Firewall, Norton Anti-Virus, automatic updates for viruses and worms, cleans up unneeded files, finds problems with your PC and fixes it for you. You can even roll back your system to a certain date if a problem occurs and return to the date before the problem started. That is great! I would not use any other product for this purpose. 
Don't think it is overly clear that Norton Systemworks is NOT Windows Vista compatible despite the fact that it's a 2007 version. For Vista, you'll have to use Norton Internet Security 2007, Norton AntiVirus or their upcoming Norton 360 
I have used a few remotes with my PVR system but none as quite as nice as this one. Most of the PC remotes I have used are either too large, clumsy or tiny and get lost easy. This remote fits well in your hand, weighs enough to feel comfortable and has a very nice layout. The large firefly button takes a bit to get used to. I have hit this button a lot by accident bringing to life an unwanted application. Once you get used to the large button being there you can avoid it. If you could change the function of this button to something useful like the application of your choice.. or perhaps the TV guide in SnapStream's Beyond TV product. On the plus side - Responsive long battery life built rugged Great fit for your hand small and compact without losing any functionality On the negative side - The big firefly button does not allow you to change its function to anything useful 
My children love it and I do too. It is a fun way to keep your brain working 
This memory improvement software is marvelous. It helps you improve your memory providing you with motivating games that will let you keep one playing. The only question you need to ask yourself before buying this software "Is English your mother language?" as the most of the games are words games.. In fact, I loved the software although I'm not first language speaker. While playing, the words that are new to me disturbed me from getting high scores. Highly Recommended for English first language speakers.. Looking forward to seeing this software in other languages. 
It's the first time I used TaxCut after years of TurboTax. Didn't have any installation problems and even the data import from last year went fine. It's basically the same thing as TurboTax, but not as slick. I guess less computer-savvy users should go with TurboTax, because navigation and entries that are off the interview path are quite tough to figure out. Despite my overall preference for Intuit's product, how can you resist the difference in price including the e-file rebate and now the $10 special rebate for TaxCut? 
I bought the full biz version and at first I just did the upgrade from XP which didn't turn out so good and the upgrade does not work correctly but then I did a fresh install and WOW!!! This OS rocks, not only is it similar to the Mac OS but for the first time it runs smooth. I installed iTunes and even the video runs smoothly with no delay. Also the new Vista mail is ten times better at catching spam and alerting you of fruad fishing mail with also a linked calendar built right in to the system that can alert you of events when the program is not even running. A+++ on this one MS, it can only get better from here... Thanks for such a great OS.. 
i like this new program but be ware that it is a RAM hog and requires a faster processor to work properl 
Except for one or two things my experience with Microsoft Office Standard 2007 FULL VERSION has been good. The coolest part is the new interface. It takes some getting used to but it is worth it 
Family Tree Maker V. 16 is still a major software purchase for the family tree enthuiist. Simple to use, many printable reports and family tree outlines. You are able to record and save all your data and it is uploadable to online-family tree site in the GEDCOM format. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so. A must buy 
I use Money to keep track of all of my Financial and Business spending patterns and tax time helpe 
I've been using the beta for a while now, so I know that I like Office 2007. PowerPoint 2007 is especially exciting and new; Word and Excel don't seem that different to me. However, I just bought the full version and I COULDN'T OPEN IT! I felt stupid until I found out that I wasn't alone. Even with instructions that I found on the Web, I had to call Microsoft. There's a transparent label over the top that you need to remove before you can pull the red tab to open the box, but you can't remove the label without tearing the Certificate of Authenticity on top (which I might want if I ever sold it). In the end, I had to take the point of a scissors and squeeze it between the cracks on either side to slit the sides open. Next, I put the CD in the drive and nothing happened. I've never knowingly turned off autorun (this is a Vista machine). I had to go into Windows Explorer and double-click setup.exe. Finally, there are two disks, but no clue anywhere that I can find what the second one is for or what it contains. The installation instructions only mention one disk. It was a frustrating beginning 
I do not understand people who do not have Antivirus, firewall, etc. software. I am not saying you have to have Trend Micro's but if you're researching products, I can tell you that Trend Micro's works very well. I used to use Norton religiously but had several viruses crop up undetected by Norton. I have now had trend micro for 2 years and when I first installed it, it picked up some viruses that Norton didn't even detect. The other difference I noticed right away was that the "footprint" on my system was extremely reduced. Norton was a monster, slowing down my system. Trend Micro works BETTER and does not hog resources. I feel that the level of protection is also very good, I have had NO major problems since I switched to Trend Micro (I repeat, NO problems). I shudder to think back to the problems I had with Norton 
Was using AVG free edition, but it failed to get rid of a nasty trojan. Liked the additional privacy features. Got a free upgrade when 2007 version released. Little drag on system resources. Reasonably priced 
The software seems to work well and best of all does not consume too many system resources. I bought this after being frustrated with how Norton seemed to take over my laptop. I'm pleased with it and use it in conjunction with Spybot Search and Destroy. Also, the price is right 
This is a renewal of one great software for me. I boutht this software several years ago on the recommendation of Consumer's Report. It is still, in my opinion, the best virus protection available. I've tried both the other two big names and find this one much easier to use. Funny thing is it is cheaper to buy a new software package than to renew through PC-Cillin. I highly recommend this software and will use it until someone comes out with something this easy and good 
This is a very nice product. Chosing what you want to paint or change is very simple. It installed easily and is quite simple to learn. My dislikes are that you do not have the option of manually adjusting the color tone. Many of the colors appear to be one color in the color selection panel but are much lighter when placed on the project. It would be nice to be able to manually darken or bighten the color. Because I was limited to the color selections they offer, I was not able to find the right color for my kitchen 
This is a very good program for either the beginner or an experinced family historian. With a easy to use interface and designed to make things simple for the user to add family members to the family tree this program is a joy to use 
Well worth the extra money to get the Collector's Edition! My dad had this version. Once we saw it we had to upgrade 
very easy to use. I was able to add several generations to my family tree with ease 
Ok- I know that a lot of people say that they have a lot of problems installing Windows XP. First of all- the way that XP Handles Drivers is very different from 95,98,ME, and 2000. Many drivers do not work with XP, so it is important to contact your hadware manufacturer(s) to make sure that it is compatible. Older hardeware (ESPECIALLY LAPTOPS) may not have drivers that are compatible with XP. However, if you are building a new PC... I highly reccomend Windows XP Professional. Home edition is okay for a lot of things. But when you get into home networking and other advanced tasks, XP Pro is the way to go. I have had 2000 on my computer before this... and I always had problems. As soon as I upgraded to XP Pro, all problems went away. I also just built another computer... and XP Professional Works seamlessly with it. I am 100% satisfied with XP Pro 
Windows XP is very good and solid. Can't wait for Windows Xp Service Pack 2 to make it even more powerfull that it already is 
I have been using Readiris 11 for about two and a half months on a project I work on about 4 to 6 hours a day. The project is to put a book I wrote about 25 years ago that was typewritten but never published onto a CD as a course. So it involves using Readiris to read the pages into Word where I edit the work. The Readiris wizard (without tinkering which was a disaster) and pages with dark ink work best. If the pages are light because of typewriter ribbon age, I must first darken them in Photoshop and then print them out for Readiris. I found that Readiris does a wonderful job and is worth every penny 
This software seems brilliant - does a very accurate job of scanning and decoding. It could be improved by allowing for multiple page scans (without having to set a timer for page insert)It will defintely save you time. IT does not appear to have an page storage/filing system like some ocr programs but 5 Stars for its scanning and decoding. Registration becomes a problem if you have to reinstall the software several times (I redo my computer frequently), it is not smart enough to know it is the same machine and forces you to contact technical support. MS Office will recognise its the same machine so its not a hassle. If you are interested in document storage and filing on the computer then other ocr might be a better choice. If you want ACCURATE page scanning for modification and changes I would MOST HIGHLY recommend this software. 
This is probably the most stable and solid release of the Corel graphics suite I've used. It has all the features necessary for illustration and photo editing, and at a price far lower than competing products from Adobe. Nice job, Corel! 
This is a great product with good features. If on Ver 12, it might not be that different I was on 9 and it was worth the upgrade price for the new features 
I got iolo's message about 'save $20 on SM7' so I went for it. Bad move. SM7 downloaded ok, installed ok, ran ONCE ok, then I couldn't get it to open up again. Then, about 30 seconds later, my computer shut itself off. My computer was only 7 months old at the time. I tried all my computer tricks about uninstalling, manually deleting files, system restore. Forget it, I was licked...all the computer would do is bootup, then after running 60 seconds or so, shut down. I had to do F10 and choose DESTRUCTIVE RECOVERY. What a drag. After spending the next day and a half re-installing all my programs it was ok. I ran it that way for the next month and a half, then the computer got a bit slow and I put SM6 back in. SM6 is running fine. SM7 is junk 
This is a game based on the story of the same name. It is a well designed game for kids that are highly intelligent. The ideas introduced in the storyline make understanding even greater math concepts simple. But keep in mind, this is not a math blaster style game, this is for bright kids that have already gone past tha 
This is even better than the book and really helped my son, age 9 understand math relationships. With all the "new" math around, it's a great tool to help kids understand why rather than method when it comes to getting it. 
I have two Dell All In One Printers that I tried to install with this new software. I could not get the 942 to work because there are no new drives that Microsoft or Dell has created and they will not be available until 6/07. I tried to install the 924, but was not initially succesful. I contacted Dell support and they told me that a new driver was available. I installed it, but was only able to print. I cannot scan, copy or fax. I contacted Dell support and they told me that this driver will only let you print. I would have to wait until a new driver was created and they told me that it would be sometime. I have talked to friends that have Lexmark and HP printers and they are having the same difficulty. If Mr. Gates and company want this product to work, they should have thought it out completely. 
Anyone embarking on something as radical as a new OS shoould do some homework at least. I trialled the beta and followed through to RC1 which I have just replaced with the full product. I used the universally available hardware scan provided by MS to prove my platforms could work with the new driver structure. It is right to say that XP SP2 is worth keeping particularly in business environments for the short term. However long term Vista is going to be the farthest reaching success for MS. When the file system update rolls out it will be mind blowing. Gamers will argue for DOS support (Mickey take) but the rest of us will enjoy the eye candy and smooth flow of effort from keypad to scree 
I just bought my 2nd copy of Outlook 2007. I really like the many more email color categories, and you can assign your own name tags to them too. Much easier to use, runs faster, better features. On the downside no documentation and MS online documentation is incomprehensible. I wound up spending an hour on the phone with MS support. If you are already running an earlier version of Office with Outlook, you must first go to add/remove programs and change office to make Outlook un-available. Then and only then put in the disk and install. Do it any other way and you will be very sorry, all kinds of error msgs. and even your previous version of Outlook will no longer work. And yes it does import your msgs. and settings from your previous version. I run XP 
Outlook 2007 did not carry all the fancy visual changes that other applications from the 2007 suite did (e.g. Word, Excel...), but the changes were quite awesome. First, it now has a sidebar with your tasks, a calendar and TO DOs... When you are on the calendar tab, you will notice a beter organization and, on the bottom, there will be the tasks due each day. Integration with other calendar tools and online schedules is much better. Also, it is much better integrated with Windows Mobile. If you buy Office 2007 Home and Student, don't forget to buy at least one copy of this Outlook because it is not in there and it is necessary for synching your Windows Mobile device. 
I purchased this program for my new Vista PC and I was quite pleased with the new and improved features, which integrates quite well on a Vista PC. As a previous owner of Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002, I have become reliant on the program for both work and home. I elected to buy Outlook and Office Student and Home to maximize my dollar towards my Office purchase and I have no regrets. The Office Standard edition does not include One Note, which is one of those programs that integrates well with the new Outlook. In the end, I spent less and got more. I would not recommend (nor do I intend) to upgrade my Office 2003 for my XP notebook. Likewise, I would not recommend purchasing Outlook without a complementary Office edition. If you have a new PC with Vista, it's a good idea to use Office 2007 in whatever fashion is most economical for your needs. If you don't use Office, there are tons of great e-mail programs that are available at no charge and an Outlook stand-alone purchase makes little sense. I think Thunderbird/Firefox is a sound choice for the non-Office user. 
we have number 1 and now this one very recommended my kids plays hours with i 
e media has made this simple and easy to understand and use. Depending on playing level it can be too easy. However, as a beginning guitar play I learned and implimented 8 chords in the 1st hour or so. The system worked flawlessly. i would recommend this system to anyone starting to play. If you have a good understanding of your chord then maybe skip this one and go on to the next 
I've played in the past but had been quite awhile, this product is excellent. Takes you step by step but quickly progresses. Really like the application, can play along, show's you cords (or hides them - your choice), records, etc. I plan on buying the intermediate level once I've completed the beginner 
Was on time, nothing wrong with it. its not anything very exciting, i got it for my bf. he likes it 
Great game. Much to enjoy. Not to easy, not to difficult 
This is a really fun game. The kids really enjoy looking for the items. It really helps that its says the items they are to find. Great Buy 
I'm not sure what software the other reviewer was using, but I've been using Office Accounting since the 2006 release and I love it. I upgraded my old 2006 file to 2007 with ease. I have been running it on a Core2 Duo machine with no issues. No crashing, etc. I used this software under Windows XP as well as Windows Vista Business. My only reason for the 4 stars is that the Online Banking features don't work like Microsoft Money does. My bank only allows Money/Quicken to connect directly, or I'm able to download an Excel sheet with my data. Office Accounting lists my bank, but tells me I need to download my data from my bank instead of it automatically doing it. I bit strange since Money handles this with no problem. Anyway, it's great software for the price.. 
A lot of brain flexing while enjoying the program's great graphics. I give the makers of this game a thumbs up for coming up with it. My son's use of it has sharpened his learning skills - without him knowing it. He just enjoys the games and funny (and safe) animation. A parent or older sibling will have to be there to help them understand some concepts, but as soon as they learn the game at level 1, it's easy to jump to 2nd then the 3rd level. Then again, this will depend on the child's age, learning ability, and the time spent on the computer. An hour with a bit of relaxing in between would be suggested when working in front of the computer to rest the eyes. 
So excellent in all departments. Program does not crash or flake out at random. Requires only included installation of QuickTime. Not frustrating for little kids due to variety. Wonderful character design and great variety of puzzles. This is the gold standard for games of this type 
I love the product. I especially like being able to type text onto scanned pdf documents. Extremely helpful for filling in government or preset forms. I should have checked the nnumber of licenses with the upgrade (only 2). I use on my office, home and laptop computers. A single license is not available so I had to buy two full upgrades 
If you love MS Paint but hate Photoshop don't buy this software. Cakewalk is not for people who want the software to do everything for them. This software replaced all my music gear and an old $250 version of Cakewalk. I now do not have to pull out my synth modules, drum machine, and digital recorder anymore. This does it all. I am totally blown away by what you get and the price you get it for. Yes, I am old school. I do actually create and modify the music. I do know what midi is and how it works. I did spend a little time learning the software. This software is not for wimps. It needs to be learned and it is not that difficult. The only thing I need to let you know that the internal synths do not sync with external but that was expected. There is a time lag between internal and external; realize that the computer has to do more math for the internal to work. No big deal. Just use the internal or nudge the track to make it sync. 
I purchased this software about 2 weeks ago, and I have to say that it is far superior to any other product in its price range. I will admit that it's not nearly as intuitive as they say it is, but the learning curve (to me) isn't that steep. I say that with some reservations, because I went to school for media production and probably have a little better knowledge base to work from than the average beginner. To make matters more difficult, Cakewalk products have (from my experience) always had very poorly written manuals. With Music Creator, they seem to have made an effort to improve in that area. It's the first Cakewalk manual I've seen that actually has screenshots of whatever the particular topic is. Thank heaven for small favors. To avoid experiences like the other reviewers apparently had, I would recommend the following 1. Buy the boxed version instead of the download from the website. Yes, it's ten bucks more and you have to pay for shipping, but with the boxed version, you do get a manual (with pictures, no less) as well as a separate CD of video tutorials, plus some other extras. Do the CD tutorials first. If you get stuck after that, the info in the Help section makes alot more sense. 2. If you don't have a background in recording, get yourself a home recording how-to book. There's millions of them out there, and they can be extremely useful if you don't really have an understanding of the jargon. One thing about Cakewalk is that they say you don't have to have any experience to use their products, but somehow they assume that you're familiar with the terminology. If you're just looking for some backing tracks to jam along with, or drag and drop MIDI sequencing, this will do the job, but is probably alot more than you need. If you're like me and are looking for an all-in-one solution that can take a song from the melody knocking around in your head to a finished, mastered product on CD or MP3 (and you don't have the cash for ProTools or Reason) this might be just what you're looking for. 
If you are still running a machine with 98 or ME, this could be your last upgrade for that machine to get a little more use out of it before having to break down and buy a new machine capable of running Vista. It drastically cut the down time due to the blue screen errors on 98 and ME 
As previous reviewers have mentioned, you should make sure your hardware and software is XP compatible before you buy. Assuming everything is compatible Windows XP upgrade is a breeze to install, once installed it is very funtional and stable. The main irritation about previous Windows operating systems was the instability. My Windows XP installation has not crashed a single time since I installed 768 MB of Ram. For a stable system it is very important that you have enough Ram. When I only had 256 MB of ram installed the system was not much more stable than Windows 98 SE. I am very pleased with Windows XP, you will be too, if you have enough Ram, and XP Compatible software and hardware. 
Please don't buy the WinXP upgrade because for one thing I had to renstall it 5 to maybe 6 times and when you do that your harddrive will make sounds. It might make a click sound. I would reccomend the full version of XP. It's so much better! 
I have taken spanish lesson course over and over and have never been able to remember enough to hold a conversation. One day with the Rosetta Stone and I have only to picture items and the name is there to identify. I love this program. 
I received Rosetta Stone Spanish, Level 1 for Christmas and I love it! The interaction and learning activities are easy to use and help you to pick up the language very quickly. I make several trips into Hispanic countries on Mission with our church and this helps me learn the things I need to communicate on a better level. 
Take it easy, get comfortable, the lessons repeat themselves and after a few hours you are amazed at how much you retain. Was sceptical at first, but the next afternoon when I was telling a friend which words I had learned, we were shocked at how much I had retained . It's easy, it's repetative, it's making me wish I had oredered all 3 levels at once. My oldest child is now takng spanish in high school, so I will order her all 3 levels. We can let her sisters use it to get a jump on spanish as well.They start spanish class in two years. This has been a good investment, as a contractor overseas working, it has paid off for the price paid and the time spent learning. Shows respect for others when you can learn their language to communicate with them. 
I started using this program so that I can learn German. I live in a Dutch speaking home and Dutch was my first language. Since the two languages are very similar I decided to begin learning German. The program is very good, although translations would be helpful, and if the grammar was explained. Also it would be nice if they introduced the definite articles with each noun introduced in the vocabulary, this would make it much easier instead of having to eventually figure out the noun gender. But all in all this program is quite good to learn basic German, move on to the second version of this program to learn more advanced things 
Not being Proficient at the computer I find the one click feature on Audio Cleaning to be a God send. Now I a'm starting to venture into other features and doing things manualy . I even uploaded songs to my MP3 player i'm still learning to use. It gets my 5 star vote. Ra 
This issue is an improvement of its previous issue, specially on the sound graphics. A very interesting feature is the extraction of music from a DVD. I used this feature without any problems and ease. Excellent product and good buy. Can recommend this issue to anybody 
This programmer has changed my life. My wife, my kids, my family, my students all love it 
I don't like to find time to review stuff like this, though all the Vista bashing is making me sick, so I feel its needed. I received Vista for free, through my engineering department of my university. If your in college check your technology website. Most universities provide lots of free software. However this is one OS I would gladly pay for. I installed the 64-bit edition of Windows Vista about 3 days ago. I can honestly say, that I have not had one driver or program compatibility issue as of yet. Of course I verified all my drivers were available for the 64-bit edition before I installed vista. Vista is very, very stable. I have not had a single problem yet. The OS surpassed my expectations, which were kind of low from all the Vista-Bashing I have read. The OS looks absolutely beautiful. Despite higher system requirements I see no slow down in terms of speed. I absolutely love the sidebar, which allows me to view my stocks, news, and weather while my computer is connected to the internet. Everything looks better to me, from control panel to the start menu. NOT A SINGLE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM TO REPORT WITH THE 64-BIT EDITION. 
This new OS is interesting. There are some features that "get in the way" as I hate having to verify everything I just told the computer to do. However, it is a nice upgrade as far as security and speed goes. Keep in mind that the hardware requirements listed are minimum requirements and Vista will operate much better on a newer machine with a faster processor, more RAM and higher end video card. It is a much faster OS than XP, but the changes require some getting used to. I would recommend holding off on upgrading at this time as there are a lot of programs that will not run on Vista as yet and even some that do are having issues with MS updates causing problems. Roxio Media Suite 9 is Vista compliant, but Vista pops a warning and shuts down a driver on system boot that is related to the Roxio software. Rhapsody doesn't work properly with it 
no problems yet so far and with its better features, most definately worth it. for a few extra bucks very much worth the upgrade from vista home to home premium. go with this product if your looking for something with enhanced security and more applications. only problem is have a bigger harddrive because this does take up a lot of space. other than that, does a heck lot more than xp in some ways but not a whole lot of changes 
This is such a great product. And it is so easy to use. Talk and they appear on the screen like magic. WOW! Great Buy and Great Gift 
I'm a freelance writer and reviewer so I do quite a bit of typing. I've had carpal tunnel for years but it has gotten progressively worse. When I saw Dragon Naturally Speaking 8 at the store I thought I would give it a try, especially since it was very affordable. This is my first review done entirely by vocal dictation. (As I'm speaking, it's writing down my words IN this review box!) It took me less than an hour to get this program up and running, and the program responds remarkably fast. The accuracy on some words is sometimes hit and miss, though. For example for "hit and miss" in the previous sentence, it wrote "hidden menace". However, there is an Accuracy Tool included which checks audio settings, perform additional training (reading information into the microphone), add words from your documents to the vocabulary, and more. I haven't used this tool yet, though. As I said, I'm less than one hour into testing this and it's performing great! If you're used to speaking fast and loose you may have to adjust your speaking style when using this tool, enunciating very clearly. During the training session they recommend speaking like a news broadcast, for example. But you don't need to speak word for word very slowly...normal speech is fine. I find the headset comfortable and I'm amazed at the responsiveness of this tool. I expected it to take longer to learn and use. If you have a limited use of your hands or have carpal tunnel syndrome, I highly recommend Dragon Naturally Speaking 8. All it takes is installing the CD-ROM, plugging in the headset to the speakers and doing a vocal test to adjust microphone levels. I'm excited to use this product, which will no doubt make life easier for both me and my hands! I love it that I can use this tool for Word Documents, emails, and website use! 
I agree this is really dumb. What's the point? The original CD's may be backed up (thank God), so it's useless as an anti-theft device. I am a Mac user, and I have messed around with using disk images to replace the CD, but without success. Apparently they only permit direct hardware calls to the CD drive. May check with some gurus to see if there is a workaround. Basically a good product, but with just enough dumb, annoying flaws (and over priced) to prevent five stars 
only hiccup this year was late forms and not the best accuracy in notifying me when they were ready. But, if you're not a spaz about doing your taxes immediately, no harm done. 
After trying several game engines, in the "affordable" class, DarkBasicPro is the only one without high end limitations. As another reviewer said, it is a wrapper for DirectX. This means you have all the capabilities of DirectX, without the complexities, including shaders, sound, media, collision detection, packaging, etc. And it gives a good frame rate! The package has matured within the last year, and many of the earlier defects have been corrected. (The manual still leaves room for improvement. Buy the Dark Basic book also, and you will be happier!) Dark Basic Pro now requires DirectX 9.0. And for really fast action games, you will need a reasonably powerful PC. If you find any command limitations, (even though it has over a thousand commands), you can always write your own DLL, and add capabilities, such as Octrees to the engine (which they don't have yet.) There now are several third party add-ons, such as "TreeMagik G2" and other enhancement packs which greatly aid in game construction. Check out the Game Creators web site, and the forums! There are other game engines which are simpler, and "spoon feed" the process to you. But once you get a little experience, you will be frustrated by the limitations caused by the watered down interface. Dark Basic Pro is not that much more difficult to use, and is tremendously more powerful and flexible. 
Having used Powerquest Drive Image for years since version 3.0, I was disappointed by their sale to Symantec and the merging into Ghost. After I upgraded to a 500 GB drive, I couldn't get Drive Image to work, so I went to Acronis. I'm very impressed with its speed and stability so far 
I replaced my hard drive on my laptop. Acronis wrote the entire contents to a portable USB drive, and then moved it back to the new hard drive. I went from a failing 120GB drive with 60 GB used, to a USB 80GB drive, then back to a new 120GB drive. You need to have a CD drive to boot from. It was fairly intuitive to use... had to think about a couple of options, but got it right the first time I used it. It copied everything... programs, Windows, Desktop, E mails, favorites, even cookies. Acronis even lets you download a trial version for free with two weeks time limit. Their on line download price was more than I got it on Amazon, and I got the box and disk from Amazon. Gen 
I had a problem where my hard drive was failing and the manufacturer was sending a new blank hard drive. I could either spend the next few weeks trying to replace the system, programs, settings, and files, or I could ghost the entire hard drive. True Image was easy to download and install (1st try). It made a mirror image of my hard drive to my USB-connect external drive in about 45 minutes and then was able to verify the back-up. There was also an easy guide to make a start-up disk on CD. When the new drive arrived, I replaced it and then True Image took care of the rest. In about 2 hours I was up and running again and didn't miss a single thing. 
Very good package, having used poser2 for some time 6 is a great improvement, loads of tools and facillities make it challanging at times to use but the results are worth it 
The 7.0 was the pits for activation. And it doesn't work with the Vista at all. I contacted Adobe so many times to try to get the 7.0 to work and finally uninstalled it. I am hoping that the 8.0 will work with the Vista. Apparently Adobe website says they have a patch for it. I have used Acrobat for 7 years and love the product. Great for web work 
Does your taxes easily. No extra fluff is needed here. Taxcut standard and money software for free. How could you go wrong 
I found Taxcut to work very well and was easy to follow. It's hard to bet it at under 9 bucks! I didn't buy the state version because the Michigan state tax form is pretty much a no brainer to fill out since you get very few deductions and once you have your AGI all you have to do is calculate the tax due. I mainly needed a tax program that would figure out if any AMT was due. The IRS paperwork for the AMT is confusing to me and I wanted a program that would do the work for me. I saw some other posts about people having problems installing taxcut and having it lock up at 21%. On the Taxcut website they talk about not having a certain font package on your computer will cause the lock up. Therefore, I downloaded and installed the font package first. Then I installed Taxcut and away I went. I ran the update manager first which took some time at my painfully slow 28.8 connection, but got through it in about a half hour. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that there are too many commercials for H block services and the donations portion was weak because it limited the amount of donation spaces to log in your donations. Therefore, I had to group the donation which was a little bit of a pain and because it thought the donations needed a special form because it exceeded some limits. And for some reason it wanted to know if they donations were post 9/27. This became a slight problem with grouping the donations. On the positive side I did like the way it logged in any capital gains for stocks or mutual funds. All that said I was able to do my taxes on a Sunday afternoon rather than over the entire week. 
I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP. It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user. 
This is a great productbecause once you install itYou need not use the cd agai 
Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar) 
Frontpage 2003 is a more enhanced version than its previous editions, works well all Microsoft operating systems, and has hands free HTML..Great!! 
Great product, great communication! Thank you! I love it! Great price 
A great product. Make sure you get a separate instruction manual. The one that is included is not enough. Make sure you do the tutorial before you start your own website. This was a relatively easy program to follow and allowed my, a person that is not real computer savvy, to create a wonderful and usable website. The pictures help greatly in the understanding of the program. Also, items to be cautious of, or areas of help are pointed out in the margins. I read the manual thorougly before starting.
