1	after going back and forth between oil of olay and neutrogena i settled on this product mostly because of the price ( plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes . ) i 'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity . the orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes ( i do it in the shower . ) of course , it 's not microdermabrasian , but it is a great exfolliater for your skin
0	i had great results with this product with the first use . however , when i used it the second time , the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface , leaving me with a smooth , useless triangle . i replaced the triangle , thinking i had a `` dud '' , but had the same thing happen with the second pad . the cream will work without the pad , but not as effectively . if the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface , they will have a winner with this product . on a positive note , i love the facial product
0	it 's quality is cheap and poorly made . i bought two thinking it was a good deal but i threw them out after 2 days because the on/off switch did n't work . it was also very loud
1	i really like this product . it 's very dry and windy here and my lips have been very chapped . the neutrogena has helped 100 % when nothing else worked ! ! i 'll definitely buy this product !
0	i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron . i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one . it does n't clamp down well on my hair ( i 've got thick frizzy hair ) . the results for me are n't that great , it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy . it 's lightweight which is nice . i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .
1	i 've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem . sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works . never falls apart and cut hair great . i 'd buy another if this one would ever wear out !
1	i am so happy with aquasana shower filter . i live in a building where the water is so harsh and sometimes discolored . as a consequence , my skin shortly turned dry and i continuously got skin problems . i even thought about buying drinking water to clean my face everyday . now that i have found aquasana , i feel so happy . it does what it promises . i could feel the smoother skin by just using it from the first time . and it did feel like showering in natural spring water . i could n't be happier with this product
1	great tasting bar . nice and soft make it easy to eat
1	had i read these reviews before buying this , i probably would n't have purchased it . but i had been looking at the much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked . i did n't ask if there was a certain model that he recommended , so i assumed i 'd have to pay from $ 40- $ 150 for a sonicare . when i saw this one for $ 30 at target , i figured i did n't have much to lose . i 've had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist could n't get . it turns off automatically after 2 minutes , so i know that i 'm brushing my teeth longer . one thing that takes getting used to is not removing it while it 's going ... you 'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself ! : d another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush ! ! the only negative is that it goes thru 2 aa batteries about once a month , but the directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change and that 's about right . i 've started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems .
1	great help in dental hygene , gets in hard to reach spots , also a lot easier than flossin
1	i 've tried many a serum , potion , lotion , cream ... every over the counter fit-it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had ! i know , iknow ... there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting , but i 've yet to see it
1	this model has all the features of the elite 9500 ( 2 brush heads , 2 cleaning modes , programmable quadpacer , and a guage to indicate about how much charge is remaining in the battery ) , but it 's $ 12 cheaper from amazon ! all the `` programmable quadpacer '' feature amounts to is the ability to leave it on for an extra ( i.e. , a fifth ) 30-second interval , or the ability to turn the timer off so that it 's just on/off . i regard most of the features as functional ornamentation ( `` bells and whistles '' ) , but the elite 9800 also happens to be a dependable , super-lightweight model that will run a good three weeks on a charge with only one person using it . i went on a three-week trip and did n't bother to pack my charger , and it had charge to spare when i got back . note : i always allow the nicd battery run all the way down ( to exhaustion ) before charging it , and that enhances both the charge and battery life . ( nicd 's only have so many charge cycles . ) if this is your first electric , you might like the way it comes out of the box programmed to gradually ramp-up the power over the first fourteen brushings . what 's the difference between the 9800 and the 9500 ? the models appear identical . the only difference i found is that one comes in a box that says 9800 , the other says 9500. : - )
0	i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom . she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time , then automatically shut off . tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail . i had to return it . however , i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great .
1	having struggled with digital scales that broke after a few years , i finally decided to get the scale my doctor has . it 's terrific because i can see it clearly ( the numbers are right in my face ) and it is built to last forever ! my daughter and i assembled it with a minimum of effort . the directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy to handle . it is clearly the best scale i 've ever owned . the down side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor scale . you can , however , buy a piece of plywood and put the scale on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom ca n't handle the bigger size
0	i bought two of these pieces of junk , and believe me they do not work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet . it recirculates the same air over and over in a tiny area ! when they say it cleans 700 cubic feet per hour , that is simply what the fan can move per hour not what it actually will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room . the fan is so weak at full speed you can barely feel it . really it is sucking in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top . both the inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically recirculating most of the same air over and over again . this thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well . in a hospital they have huge systems that move the air past larger arrays of bulbs . so here you are sitting in a room with your kids coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air over and over again , in a little tiny airspace , what a great deal . just be ready to buy 10 of them per room . maybe you can try hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a 4 ' x5 ' bathroom and it might work in a week . do yourself a favor , and buy a machine that has more uv light bulbs , and has a greater airflow so all the air in a room is moving and all of the air in the room goes through the filter . i gave it a one because it looks nifty .
0	before the very first filter ever even finished , it started to crack all over ... cheap produc
0	the foam is tooooo.. soft . it 's does not give me any back suport that i need it .
1	i love the this set , expecially the nail cutter , i , m still using mine after six years
1	by far , the best hair straightener i have purchased . i have spent so much time , money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results . i can now say that i have found it . i bought the 2 '' turbo and it gets the job done on my course , naturally curly hair . one of my all time , favorite purchases . i never travel without it
0	i took a chance ( it 's pricey ) and purchased this item . what the heck , i thought . i used it ( a single 'squirt ' ) once a day in the morning . this was instead of the recommendation of twice a day . i like the stuff . my skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy . in fact , i 'd give it five stars except that now it 's three weeks since i purchased this product and 'poof ! ' it 's gone ! i figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt . in my mind the 'goodness ' of this product is n't worth the exorbitant price . hence , two stars
1	i carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back , and as a result get a lot of headaches . i have been using the real-ease for about two months , and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches . i have not used it as a preventative - only when i already have a headache . if something happened to the one i have , i would definitely buy another
1	i have used this blood pressure monitor almost every day for weeks and it works great . it 's an excellent value and i would recommend it to my friends without reservation
1	i have used this twice a day and love it . best buy at this price
0	i used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades . i have always cut myself occasionally , but when i cut myself with the fusion power , i got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar ! talk about sharp ! i went back to using it and then a month or so later i cut myself again and this one was even worse . you could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin . i tossed the fusion in the garbage , went back to the 3-blade , and wrote gillette an e-mail to complain , to which they did not respond . i 've read all 60 reviews before mine , and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem . maybe it 's my shaving technique , but this thing is a weapon
0	i am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging `` palm kernel oil '' as an ingredient . do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil , cocoa butter , and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many `` organic '' things are added to it . for many years now , it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease . the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases .
0	we have three of these humidifiers , the elephant , the penguin and the cow . have had them for 6 months or so . in the last two weeks , both the penguin and cow have stopped working all together and the elephant is the sole survivor . when we got them , i thought they were amazing , quiet and did the job . now i am deciding if i should go out and buy two more or pick another brand . oh and be careful , i think the steam from my sons killed his dvd player on his tv as it gets caked with the white stuff ... .
1	my wife and i both love this . in our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable `` head trip '' than the trippers one might find in the mall . the vibrations make it better than the non-vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming . another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations . it 's a pretty simple device , sold at a reasonable cost , and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones
0	returned right after i tried it ... does not get hot at all . very disappointed since it is so expensive
0	this product is worthless . save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else . i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank . i 'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in
0	the monitor works really well . the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking . if you are looking for a good basic monitor , this is a great unit .
0	ok , it does get hot quickly . but only when i can get it to turn on . after about 6 months , the connection to the power switch became loose . now i have a hard time getting it to turn on . i 'm about to buy a different iron with a different type of switch
1	i bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for christmas . it was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using . he has been enjoying the features offered by this device . he especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use . it gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves . he has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints . it was a great price for a quality product
0	this product hurts and ripps out your hair when you use it . it also leaves ur hair smelling bur n't and smokey . when you go out and it is humid ur hair will go back to its normal self and get very frizzy . the only good thing is that it does not break easily
0	the product does not work as it is shown on tv . there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy . the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust
0	these are a cheap knock off of huggies pull-ups . and once the side comes apart , you ca n't put it back together like with pull-ups . over all a waste of money . just use pull-ups , they 're worth the extra money..
0	the ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time i put it in the freezer ! evidently , the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze , so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed ! in addition to that , my soup was luke warm at lunchtime
1	after brushing with the hydrabrush , my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist . this is a great product . i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon
0	i used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades . i have always cut myself occasionally , but when i cut myself with the fusion power , i got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar ! talk about sharp ! i went back to using it and then a month or so later i cut myself again and this one was even worse . you could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin . i tossed the fusion in the garbage , went back to the 3-blade , and wrote gillette an e-mail to complain , to which they did not respond . i 've read all 60 reviews before mine , and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem . maybe it 's my shaving technique , but this thing is a weapon
1	i recently started weight watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale . i figured i would buy a ww product , but after reading the reviews , i decided to go with the omron scale . i am very pleased with this product . it has been extremely accurate . it keeps a history for both my husband and i. i would highly recommend this scale to anyone ! it is also an attractive scale which is a bonus . go with the omron scale
1	my wife found the women 's version of this cologne in bermuda and it smells great , so i happen to see the man 's version of her cologne and tried it and thought it was great as well . fruity yet woodsey smell hard to describe , girls will eat it up !
0	this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington before this product gives me nothing but trouble
1	these are great glasses , easy to put on and take off , and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them . i saw them on the csi ny coroner on tv and had to find some . amazon was the place to go
0	i was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed , because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it
0	i really like the crane humidifiers for children , my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time . it occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet . so i was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good . i was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than i had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different . still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it did n't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off . this may be a fault with the one i received and so i have sent it back , or it may be a design flaw with this shape . i have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere . so although i have n't had chance to use it i am more hopeful of success . it is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them , i forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time
0	it vibrates like a massage mode of sonic complete . you 'll get less than what you pay . you should brush hard even while it is vibrating
0	i recently bought his blow dryer and to my surprise when i use it it sends out huge sparks and smoke towards my head ... . pretty dangerous in my opinion , i do n't reccomend it
0	i 've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment , and i figured this would suit my mopping needs . it has n't . even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the wetjet , i 've found that it does n't really pick any dirt up . what i wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere . i 'm even using the `` special '' hardwood floor solution- it is n't making a difference . i do n't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor ( and there are probably better solutions for that as well )
0	this pedometer is so much cheaper ( ~ $ 7 ) than the typical decent ones ( that go for about $ 18 - $ 20 ) .. now i know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy , the package looks very cheap , the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work , also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor . would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron/oregon sc $ 18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability and quality
0	i 've had this straightener for about 3 months - i loved it at first but now it 's a love/hate relationship . the `` gold '' plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use . the effect , my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff ! to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates . i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair , something that is hard to do ! this is the second store brand straightener i 've purchased with poor results . save your $ $ $ and buy a professional model from a hairdresser - it 's cheaper in the long run
0	i purchased the kaz ultra king size heating pad off ebay to replace another kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months . well , this is no different except i now have more expensive heating pad that is useless . just like the other reviewers , my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process . i plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time . i also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds , sometimes two or three at once . nothing worked . its was nice while it lasted -- heated well without getting too hot . it is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months . thumbs down ! do not purchase a kaz softheat heating pad if you value your money .
1	compared to the energy bars on the market these days ( cliff , powerbar , etc . ) that taste terrible , hooah bars are awesome . they really work too , energy wise . great for long bike rides , triatholons , etc . or even something to eat before practice for athletes . they are awesome ; i am a huge fan
1	we have a goldendoodle with a lot of hair and this clipper works wonderfully . it breezes right through the thickest hair ! i highly recommend
1	i have had so much fun learning bio feedback and learnig to breath . the exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation . i highly recommned this product . i will be purchasing the add-on in the near future
1	it 's pretty good ... do n't see it making anything `` firmer '' but it works nicely as a moisturizer . i checked the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has been posting the same thing [ about it ruining their life ] all over the net . probably an allergic reaction , you always have to test a little piece of skin before slopping something in your eyes ;
1	i did n't have any trouble with them being too large . i tested them in a battery-operated light string against a no-name , non-rechargeable brand and they lasted almost exactly the same amount of time .
1	i bought another one of these because i dropped my orginal at the grocery store and broke the bulb.i tried contacting the company with this new one.u can not get an answer . the company seems to have a non working number . other than that , the product ok and i havent been sick since i have used it./
0	the mirror 's light is quite dim and the magnification ( 5x ) is inadequate for most purposes
0	i was just given this set- new- and was impressed by the reviews . i 'm not sure if it 's just my hair , but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer . i figured i needed to work out the kinks and give it another try . again same look and that 's all the curl i have after 20 minutes . concept is good- just does n't work on my fine , full head of hair . if you want curl stick to the hot rollers .
1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one . this is an excellent product . my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again . one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good , lol , and eyelining is a breeze . though he would never admit it , my husband uses also ( trimming mustash , nose hairs ( eewww ) , shaving , etc . ) great product . order one . you will not be dissapointed !
1	this is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs . also check out elaine petrone 's miracle balls , which you can also use in the car and for other things . the support is sturdy and has a mesh back , which helps to keep you cool and comfortable . a great deal for the cost
1	item was received in perfect shape . it is a wonderful item and a great buy
1	i have had 2 other sonicare toothbrushes and love them ! i shopped around and due to amazon 's fabulous return policy and excellent customer service ... there was no question where i would purchase . their price was very competitive and their excellent customer service made it easy to feel good about buying here
1	i like this product a lot . my hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath . i used this product and my hair looks good now . it looks smooth and straight now and i can feel the softness when i touch my hair . i definitely will recommend this product to my friends ... ..
0	it puts out a cloud of water vapor and it 's not all that noisy but i had no idea i 'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart , wiping it down , trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down , refilling the tank twice a day , and wondering why this humidifier does n't have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off . at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find . however , this is too much like an unwanted hobby so i 'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room
1	i 've had one of these little trimmers for four or five years now . it does its jobs , and i 've have no reliability problems at all . one word of advice -- do n't use it on `` the boys '' without the little plastic guard or you 'll be sorry..
0	this product is difficult to use and does not clearly cover the scratches on the lenses as advertised . there are bubbles in the product that do not clear up as it dries . i do not recommend this ! just get new glasses
1	my hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing/smoothing products -- they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth . my hair is very fine , but also thick ( which is very annoying ) . this finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down . it seems very expensive for such a small bottle , but a little goes a long way ( i 've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it 's still not finished ) . definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all . the scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming .
0	i bought this scale as an upgrade from a wal mart cheapo scale . hated it ! ! i should have read the dimensions more carefully , but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom . worse still , it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first . had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again . returned the item , but ate the $ 11 return ship fee - it 's huge and heavy
1	i like the shampoo . it is nice . but i do not like the plastic bottle . because you can not remove the cap
0	i am on my second zadro led lighted fogless mirror - yes , customer service was decent and they sent me a new one . however , the initial problem was repeated plus some -- it fogs up despite following directions , using their spray , and using words i shoul n't repeat here . additionally , the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months . one good thing is that suction cups still hold it up as long as i press them in every week . this product has problems which make a mockery of its `` zfogless '' claim . save yourself the trouble -- do n't buy it
1	i ordered these disposable pampers for my son . they are great . i ordered them and recieved free 2 day shipping
0	fails at it most basic function : to provide a non-leaking seal . you might as well throw the top away and just use your hand to cover the top
0	i ordered these slippers as a gift . to my embarassment , the gift never arrived . i received an email stating that the slippers were backordered . weeks later i received another email stating it would be an indefinite time before the product would be available . i just cancelled the order . i am defiitely an un-happy customer .
0	this straightener has been one of the worst i have ever used . it did n't straighten at all . i had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight . it did not stay straight either. & lt ; br / & gt ; waste of money ! ! ! do n't buy
1	after brushing with the hydrabrush , my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist . this is a great product . i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon
0	they claim that it helps you fall asleep and keeps you asleep . i did fall asleep sooner , but was n't able to stay asleep . i did n't find it to work well at all .
0	this is worthless and they say it 's refundable , until you read the fine print and realize it 's only if you bought the entire product line . it is crap and does n't do anything . do n't waste your money , drink milk and your hair will grow . this does not work
0	every time i use the product -- - 3 out of 4 times i receive an error and have to try it agai
0	the description of the ingredients lists `` d-alpha tocopherol acetate '' as the main ingredient . however , the product bottle indicates that the actual main ingredient is `` dl-alpha tocopherol acetate '' , an articial and very different version of the advertised ingredient . the amazon.com listing is very misleading
0	i decided to try the caffeine free mega-t because i quit caffeine a couple years ago and did n't want a diet supplement with caffeine . i only needed to lose 10 pounds . took as directed for 1 week . also followed the diet and exercise program per the enclosed pamphlet . after 1 week , to my dismay , i actually gained 3 pounds ! i contacted cca industries , the company that makes mega-t , and they promptly informed me that they have a 30 day guarantee and to return them , along with my receipt , for a refund . i shipped them back yesterday . i gave a 2 star rating because of cca industries ' customer service
0	it was a nice looking razor but it did n't work and i had to send it back for credit . i bought another one locally and had trouble with it also . i wonder if the 5200 just does n't have to many bells whistles . i finally bought a 5100 it 's a plain jane but is working great
1	i have used the unit for about two weeks , with nimh rechargable batteries installed , and it performs as advertised . there is , in my opinion , a design flaw : the start/stop button acts as the power on { off function , and is easily depressed at unwanted times , e.g . putting into or removing from the case . they could/should have included an ac adapter
0	of course it works great - for as long as it works . after some time , my unit develped a leak . unlike better showerheads , the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time , causing the seals to not set properly , resulting in the kind of leak mine developed . unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years , i 'd stay away fom this model . and good luck navigating watrepik 's website to get any help
1	the product is very good , do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago : the curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes . but still , we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes . it 's a good buy
1	after just 3 weeks of using this product my fasting blood sugar has dropped to 111 . thats over 40 points ! ! ! ! pretty impressive . my dr. started me on metformin but it made me very sick . this stuff works much better wiht no side effects . i wish i had known about this years ago as i have been fighting with high fasting sugars for years . this product is a god send .
1	this review is about the oral-b flexisoft replacement heads . coupled with the braun electric toothbrushes , this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed . my introduction to oral-b goes back over 27 years to a usaf basic training briefing ; a dental technician held up an oral-b toothbrush with medium bristles and said `` this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth '' or some such statement like that . well , i have n't lost one yet . the motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites . while the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents , there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing . since i 've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush , i know i 'm using less toothpaste to do the same job . while this is no big deal , the long term economic benefit is plaque under control , healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth . it 's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination . just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing . oral-b uses a kind of color code for the bristles , and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness . enjoy life
1	i have had this heating pad for over a year and am very pleased with it . the auto shut off is annoying when i forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but otherwise , very pleased . just ordered one for my grandma and she is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it does n't `` rattle '' like the old fashioned ones . great improvment and larger size
0	manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs , as this device is very fragile . not a good consumer product
1	after reading other reviews on air mattresses i was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed . but it 's been over 2 months and so far so good . i sleep on it every night , ( i 'm buying a real bed when i move in june ) and it is holding up
1	this is the best and easiest to use back brush ! i have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just did n't do it but with this brush no more missed spots . just hang it up and it dries and is ready for the next time . never felt so clean
1	i have two penguin humidifiers which i purchased a couple of months ago . for the money i think these are great and simple to use . i did not have any problems with leakage -- the key is to make sure that the top is on securely . also , some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base -- just carry a washcloth with you -- no problem . super quiet . i think it is just the right size for a bedroom . easy to clean and fill . i had tried others ( honeywell and vicks ) and this is by far my favorite
1	this is a great value - probably one of the best shower heads i 've used . yes - there are better ones for $ 100+ , but this is absolutely amazing
0	-- as i found it to be really much too fake-lemony , not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms . i mixed mine w/ a subtle `` cookie '' -type one i coud n't smell at all now can smell neither , even when i put them in closets , which was not the idea -- i like a little fragrance thru the house . may look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood
0	this is easily the worst beard trimmer i 've used . it slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated , and the teeth on the guard are far too fine
0	i could n't even make it to that `` magic '' fourth or fifth day when all cravings are supposed to magically disappear . from the very beginning , i was so incredibly jittery , which is 1 of the claims hoodia reps make . i , also feel sleepy all the time , yet i ca n't nap and my sleep has been severely disrupted by all the jitteriness- i 'm what you call too tired to sleep ! really , how many over-the counter appetite suppressants actually work . i believe none of them work better than a placebo ( and maybe that 's what some of you are experiencing ? ) . do n't bother with this one . a total waste of a lot of money - this stuff is n't exactly cheap , either ; take your $ $ and go buy some sneakers , get a little exercise you 'll be a lot better off !
1	this is the best invention yet . i could not believe how warm and smooth the cream felt . what a difference from cold cream to warm cream . the cream itself was smoother and yes , buttery ! i love this , this is my best investment yet
0	the bars look like mudpies , are very dry , and all three `` flavors '' taste the same , meaning that they do n't have much flavor at all . i much prefer certain flavors of balance bars . the only good thing about these clif bars is that i do n't get hungry for several hours after eating one
0	i received this tweezer for christmas , so i 'm glad i did n't spend anything for it because it 's not even worth 50 cents . the tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs . it 's a piece of crap as far as i 'm concerned . do not bother purchasing this product , if you do , you 'll regret it
1	i just bought a vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high . i needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet . these goggles are awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet , and because the wrap around my head , they stay put . the magnets in front are very strong so the goggles do n't move . the eye cups are just the right size and they 're padded for comfort . these goggles have far exceeded my expectations .
0	my rheumatologist recommended that i try a wax bath product for the osteoarthritis in my thumbs . the cartiledge in the left thumb is all but gone , with the right thumb being in better shape . the wax bath did not eliminate or ease the pain in either thumb , but did greatly improved the skin on both hands . i continue to use it just for the dry skin on my hands , and am pleased with the results . it 's possible that this product would have worked better for me if i 'd used it earlier , before my thumbs got so bad . i plan to use the wax bath for the pain from inflammation in my feet , due to rheumatoid arthritis . i did have to turn down the heat due to a lifelong and extreme sensitivity to heat in my hands , and this is probably why the wax doe n't stay warm for longer than 10 - 12 minutes , even when wrapped in the plastic bags and then in a towel . the initial loading of wax has lasted a long time , so i do n't recommend purchasing more than 2 or 3 pounds of wax at a time
0	i once had a cheap shaver i got at sears that i learned was made for sears by remington . i liked that shaver , so when i found the r-950 at sears on sale for $ 40 , i decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver . big mistake . after 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck ( especially with drier winter skin ) , not to mention the occasional cut lip i get with the r-950 while trying to shave around the mouth , i am going back to my old shaver . how can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave ... but it does .
0	the elastic part is tape and my husband accidetly stuck it to our daughters legs . when i changed her diapr next she screamed because the tape was on her leg not the diaper . this could happen to anyone , nd i 'm sure it 's not good for a new baby 's skin
1	this model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago . i bought another off of amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it , and i figured i could use a second one to keep in my travel bag . i 'd have to say i 'm pretty pleased with the trimmer . i like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when i want to change the trimming depth . i use it a few times a week , and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge . the little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest ... .it 's catches probably 70 % of what i trim . you 'll want to be sure you 're standing over a sink or towel when using it . well worth the $ 30 i spent for this grooming tool
0	please take this horrible misrepsentation off of your web site , or at the very least practice honesty in advertising . this unit is so small that all it good for is ties , shorts and socks . i feel violated by amazon and conair
1	the day i ordered this pair at amazon , i saw the same homedics slippers at sears for $ 21.99 on sale and i was immediately assured that price wise , this is a great buy . i got the slippers within 3 days . the material is very soft and `` towely '' , and pretty in pink- it feels really good to just walk in them . though they have a battery compartment underneath the sole , they are not too heavy to walk in either . each slipper uses 2 aa batteries . the massage is actually more effective while sitting . and my mum and my sister keep eyeing my slippers . i ordered another one for my future mum-in-law as well ! i 'm sure she 'll love it . also , i wear a shoe size 8 , sometimes 8.5 , but the homedics small size for the massaging slippers fit just fine , actually a little better coz a good fit gives a better feeling of the vibrations . if you 're thinking of buying this , go for it
0	shaker is adequate for breaking down whey , but it leaks . i always have to wash my hands and the outside of the bottle after making anything with it
0	i really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is . not . the motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working . you wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again . but by the time you are getting results in one area of your foot , the thing heats up and stops working again . i went through four intervals of effective operation , heat build-up causing it to quit , waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again . finally i decided it is n't worth the time and aggravation , even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked . one more thing -- when i gave up and decided to return it , i took my duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot . i worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor . i 've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this . update : found something much better after returninng the artemis , i tried the medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance . this one costs 5 times the price of the artemis but is soooo much better it is well worth it . the medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated artemis . it has variable speeds , 5 different sapphire filing attachments , and enough power to operate as long as you need . the sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime , whereas the artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries . so over time the costs of owning the artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out . if you have serious callouses and corns , like i do , the medicool pedisenso will do a very serious , rewarding job . i 'm so glad i found it and i am grateful for the relief it provides
0	this shampoo made my dandruff even worse . after using it , it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed , but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it . if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell 's tea tree shampoo or something .
0	bought it and it worked for like a month . now it just sits in my room doing nothing . i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back . if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality
1	bought this to help make muddy paw print clean up a little quicker . this works well , my better half thinks i have an obsession with mr. swiffer ... : ) it does leave a haze on the floor though . i use the recommended 3 sec . cleaner dispense ... maybe it 's because i do n't change the pads ofter enough . overall , i would purchase the swiffer again if i had too
0	the design is great , very light , easy to handle . it 's very nice to be able to use it cordless . however , this is the least powerful epilator i have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history . ( i have gone through six epilators . ) it takes forever to clear a small area .
1	i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body . after drinking monster all day , my body felt like a mess ( from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body ) . there are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals , its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls .
1	i got into aquis microfiber towels because my aged mother does not have the arm strength for big fat terry towels . i then bought some for myself because besides being light they absorb like crazy -- one swipe and you 're dry . i decided to get one of the 'adventure ' line because information was that they are like the dog-drying towels which are very like the lisse crepe ones . what i did n't realize was not only i buying a very nice towel , it comes in a very nice little nylon zippered bag , mesh on one side to facilitate drying . we 're talking the sort of little bag you 'd spend about $ 5 to buy from a travel gear catalog . i was thrilled to pieces . also in keeping with the 'adventure'-travel theme , these towels have little tags on one corner that can be snapped back on themselves to form a loop to hang the towel from . very handy for camping , meaningless but not annoying for home use . i like how the loop normally is just a long tag so that the loop does not tangle in the washer
0	i bought this cushion because i had to move from california to new york and expected the drive to be torture on my back . i researched these types of cushions and decided to get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper units , and because i had recently bought a mogu pillow and really liked the soft feel of it -- this cushion has `` sqush , '' which has a similar feel.the cushion has a middle portion of sqush which is concentrated into 3 `` lumps '' -- at your shoulders , lower back , and under the front part of your thighs , near your knees . the lumps are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex-like material . the rest of the cushion feels like fleece.when i first plugged it in , i was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy motors . even at the highest intensity ( i never even bother with the lower two ) , it felt like nothing more that a moderate vibration -- definitely not enough to un-knot an aching back . the pre-set programs are fine but i rarely use them . it comes with straps but i had a hard time trying to install it in my car because the instructions were non-existent and it was n't intuitive at all . i ended up just attaching them to some hardware on the underside of the chair , which worked well.i ca n't decide if the cushion made the drive any more bearable . the lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back and made it hurt . the thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of the seat ( my car does n't have fancy seat controls ) and i had to wedge myself into the seat . the massaging feature was helpful because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped a little to keep the circulation going , but it simply was n't powerful enough to be really effective . the worse thing is that the thigh motor died only a few hours into my trip ! ! it has a 2 year warranty , but you have to pay a $ 5 `` handling '' fee ! i 'm mad at myself for throwing away the box because if i had n't , i 'd return it to amazon and wash my hands of it.overall , this cushion is underpowered , unreliable , and not as orthopedically correct as it should be . it is definitely not worth the outrageous price . i regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead . i wish i had saved my money for homedic 's highly rated shiatsu seat cushion instead , although i 'm somewhat leary of their product reliability now
1	we have a `` closet shower '' , which made it difficult to get out of the way of the water spray ( not to mention having water spray out the door ) . we picked up this neat little shower head , and we 're much happier now . you can avoid the water more easily ( for shaving , washing body , etc . ) , and since it aims straight down , no more turning the shower head all the way to the side to avoid it going right out the door . it 's inexpensive , and has made our shower experience much better . i definitely recommend it
0	i did n't want to spend a lot of money on an ionic hair dryer . i came across this one and thought i 'd give it a try . the light indicating the ionic generator is working stopped working after its first use . what a waste of money !
1	the biosafe thyroid test is accurate and simple to use . the results came back in less than a week and matched my doctor 's results ! thanks biosafe
1	this would be a perfect curling iron if heated to a slightly higher temperature . it takes a little longer to curl my hair because of the lower temperature
0	this epilator by emjoi does not work without the cord attached - the motor is too weak . in addition , the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends - the middle disks , since they are inset from the top , never reach the hair . i had to return this item , and i would not trust or recommend any item by emjoi . extremely poor quality , and does not work as promised
1	i am totally satisfied with thids product so far . of course if the batteries run out of charge after a few charges i will be dissatisfied . i expect them to last tens of reusses if experience can be of any guideline
1	i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model . the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth . it 's a bit louder than the older model , probably because it 's got an additional motion , and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light . overall , just what we wanted
1	this is a good massager that can hone in on the pressure points . the knob is a little large for getting at specific reflex spots , but generally does the job
0	i read all the reviews thought this would do the trick . my daughter does not like the results at all . it does not straighted her hair as it states . i wish i would have spent a little more $ $ on a better one
1	as an emergency nurse practitioner and paramedic , i can not emphasize enough the importance of getting electricity to an adult who is suffering from cardiac arrest . technology is moving quickly to get electricity to the cardiac arrest victim earlier and earlier -- and the survival rates and quality of life rates after such an arrest are sky rocketing accordingly . is there too much direct-to-consumer marketing by medical-related companies ? probably . is your personal risk for experiencing sudden cardiac arrest per calendar year low ? definitely . ... but do those smug reviewers refuse to buy vehicles with airbags in them just because their risk of being in an accident is low and the direct-to-consumer marketing is irritating to them ? no ! those will be the same folks who want their cars with anti-lock breaks , airbags , the best side-impact reinforcements ... and being a good driver ( ie , `` just improve your diet '' ) wo n't cancel their risk for being in an accident . i hope you never have to use this machine , but as an emergency healthcare worker -- both pre-hospital and in the emergency room -- i can not say enough positive about aed 's in the community setting ! do n't run out and purchase this out of paranoia , however if yuo are at risk for a sudden cardiac event consider if this would be appropriate for you , your family members , your apartment building , your church , etc . ... and rest assured that it is absolutely safe -- it is impossible to hurt a loved one with this , you can only help . ... and to those who gave negative reviews on this aed ? do n't forget to pay your car insurance ! ..
1	these are a helpful item for me ; the cloth pockets are nice , and the instructions for microwaving are clear and simple
1	this product was nothing short of miraculous for me . i 'm in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since i hit my teens ... and while i have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea ( which started about age 40 ) , including retin a cream , topical and systemic antibiotics , and every sort of over the counter cleanser , these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as i aged . i 've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it 's been in many years ... .i had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it . caution - i 've never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity . people who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably wo n't have the same kind of experience i do . bp creams have always helped , but were not as effective as this mask , which really gets down in the pores . i use it heavily . i apply it either before i brush my teeth or before i get in the shower . it is cool and refreshing . i usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before i rinse off , although sometimes i use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening ... like after i 've walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke . it leaves my skin very , very clean , and *soft . * i have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all ... indeed , my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time . the dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me . it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin . working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty , dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out . now before cleaning or working i will actually put a bit of this mask on- wne i am done , my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity ... i stay clear and smooth . i guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria . i do not have serious acne all over my body ... just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life . the benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me . i simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth , and wash it off . no prescriptions , no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules ... just perfect skin for me . amazing ! ! !
1	i own an older dispensor , from around 1999 , and i was afraid that these filters would n't fit . they do and seem to work fine . i ca n't find a `` replace '' indicator on these new ones , the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them . i guess that i just have to replace it on a calendar basis , they say the filters are good for 2 months
0	i do n't know where amazon got these cases of all small mighty , free clear . i use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it . from my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo . the amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint . it also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version . at the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout . the amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout . at first i called the manufacturer . their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call . so i decided to use it . i do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes . i would not purchase this again from amazon . the price is not that great to overcome the odd differences . i will , however , continue to purchase this product from my local retailers
1	this is the best reacher i have ever used . i am in a wheelchair due to ms and have used various types over the past 6 years but the quality and ease of use is much better with this .
0	i was very happy with my purchase . the company chose to mail it to me via priority mail in order for it to arrive before christmas . i was very pleased ! ! ! !
0	after doing extensive research on the web , i purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor . while the easy fit cuff was easy to place , the b/p readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous b/p cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor 's office . since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings , i returned the b/p cuff to amazon for a refund .
1	its a very nice little fountain . the lighting on the ceiling is really cool and the water noises are adjustable depending on how you arrange the rocks . it does n't have near enough rocks , so i 'm going to go and get some , but i think once i fill it up a little more it 'll look a lot better too . i 'm satisfied , i actually bought another one :
1	mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well . i like the way this cream gives instant glow
0	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles . it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it . if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere
1	i am one of the people who just does n't like applying liquid foundation and can not do it well , but needs more than just the light coverage of powder foundation . the new complexion cream foundations do exactly that . i have used numerous cream ( or liquid-powder ) foundations and this is by far the best and at a good price as well ! the neat little compact includes a mirror and separate storage space for your sponge , which i love because i hate when my sponges become covered in product , all in the same space as a regular compact . i 've personally never been one to use compact mirrors , myself , however . but it 's not the package or the sponge which i love , it 's the product . it 's neither too liquid nor is it too stiff , like some products . it 's perfectly creamy and works well with the sponge it comes with . you really need n't use a lot to have even overall covered but by using more you can obtain a thicker coverage . i find that this makeup blends well with my skin and does a good job of evening out my skin tone , as well , without appearing too much like a mask . you can feel it a little but it somehow just feels right on my skin . also , i do recommend using a powder over it to reduce shine . overall , i love this makeup
0	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them . i wish i had known this before . now i have to waste about $ 20 in shipping to return it . do not buy for body fat measurement
1	all there products are great ! they smell good and are good . lathering is a more work but thats because they 're natural . i use them on my babies and toddlers
0	i was happy to see this type of product available , but was not happy when i received it . it seems like a flimsy piece of plastic , and the `` magnets '' looked like they were painted on , a gold-tone , and the paint looked like it was chipping off . the base of the item is separate from the top of the item , which seems to be attached with springs ? it did run , but was very loud , like it was working too hard . there is a note not to use it more than 20 minutes , which i 'm not sure is because of a potential adverse affect with the user , or because the unit might overheat . there were some spelling errors on the outside of the box ( a few places said `` reflexology '' and a few places said `` relexology '' ) -- but maybe that just bothers me ? i think it is also important to note that the buyer pays shipping , and if returned -- also pays return shipping charges ; and when combined , nearly equals the original cost of the item . ; o (
1	most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product . i think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is , as someone else suggested , that people need to pay attention to how , exactly , this trimmer works . because of its design , best results are obtained when it is inserted , withdrawn , then inserted again , and the procedure repeated . second tip : rinse the rotating blade , switched on , under the hot tap to remove accumulated hair , etc , after each use . it works better when clean . the main plus of this product is its size . yes , it is flimsy , made in china , and would probably sell for $ 2.50 if it did n't say panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month panasonic warranty . but it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean . i have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available
1	having tried most all energy drinks , i can honestly say this one is different . guru picks me up gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been clipped . one at noon and i 'm good to go for the rest of the day . plus , i do n't go home and kick the dog ! the taste is not sugary and at about $ 1.40 a can ( free shipping ) the price speaks for itself
0	it does n't get hot enough , nor does it stay hot for more than 10 minutes
0	babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact , useful size . however , the rollers take a long time to heat up . even if left plugged in for a half-hour , they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair . i would not recommend this product
1	lightweight , easy to transport , easy to put together . just remember , the person in the chair can not maneuver on their own . someone must be able to push . but what a great product
1	i have medium colored hair , and i 've used this trimmer many times . it shaves away the hair just fine for me , you know need to know how to get to all the hair . if your hair is so coarse that this trimmer does n't work , you i 'd recommend waxing ! fast , effective , good angling
1	i am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of clics i own . if you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect . their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on ! i 'd look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer . lastly ~ i 've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use
0	i have used this product inside my bedroom during the last few months but i have not felt there was any improvement in the air . during the winter months , i generally get sore throat and an occasionally fever . this year , nothing has changed since using this product . this product is as good as the electric pest repellers .
0	i had an old caruso molecular setter that finally conked out . i thought the ion feature of this would be great . the clicking is annoying , but if it worked , i would n't mind . this puts out way less steam , causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system . then , after all that , it only curls about 1/2 as much . so , it takes longer for less curl -- not worth it . i hope i can get another caruso , but i hear they have problems now , too . ahhhh , remember the good old days when things worked
1	this monitor is so easy to use , and more convenient than going to the grocery store . it saves the readings in memory , so if i do n't have a pen and paper handy , i can retrieve the info later . it even shows the time the reading was taken .
0	1500 mgs etc ... advertised , is misleading as 1500 mgs refer to the daily recommended dose contained in two pills . honest advertising would quote 750 mgs etc ... per pill ! i will definitively not purchase any product from that unreliable source . i believe amazon should check it 's suppliers with more scrutiny as their misconduct reflects on amazon - a generally very reliable ecommerce site . nessim
1	i have three types of headlamps and i like this one the most . here is why : 1 ) it 's cheap , 2 ) it runs a long time on three aaa batteries , and 3 ) the red light is awesome . you can use the red light and still keep your `` night vision '' . i use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or distracting to others as a white light . my only problem with it is that the knobs are a little confusing , even after two years of use . i often have to twist twice to get the right setting . and i 'm usually good at that stuff
1	this is a great product , easy to program and use.. easy to read digital display and very accurate
1	this is a great shaver . if you are in the market for one , considered the remington r-960 . i am of afro-american descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver . i had always gotten excellent results using remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug . with its ergonomic design , it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas . i had considered purchasing that of another brand until i discovered that remington makes one and now ... i 'm loving it
0	i 've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well . i 've worn out 3 norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase i thought . this razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it . i have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart , but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave , and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face . i 'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift
1	saved my love life , literally . it worked for me in a couple days and though its a tad pricey well worth the money , doesnt burn or sting either . if only all other stuff i used worked this good i coulda had a date to the prom . cause i tried everything . thanks princereign
1	well , let 's face it..short of any procedure that is invasive ( botox , cosmetic surgery , etc ) , there really isnt any magic cream that is going to reverse the aging process , but there are a number of products that will aid in improving the look , feel and texture of your face . i 've been trying out several of the products out there , and i found `` olay total effects night firming cream for face and neck '' to be one of the best ones around . i really like this one alot because of the many benefits it has all in one jar . after using it pretty generously for a little over a month ( i 've used about 1/2 the jar so far ) , i found it worked wonders on improving the look and feel of my skin . it minimized the appearance of fine lines , really hydrated my dry skin , improving on firmness , absorbed deep into my skin , so using it every night , i could still feel the softness the next morning , and left my face feeling very smooth to the touch . i especially felt and saw visable result around my neck and throat area ( where i am really starting to get that over 50 look ) . it has a nice , very light scent , and here 's the best part ... the price here at amazon is about 1/2 of what i paid when i purchased it along with my groceries at the market ( and it was even on sale at the store ) , so at around twelve dollars here right now , it 's a real bargain . there are 7 benefits listed on the box , some i mentioned above , others include evening skin tone , minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces the appearance of blotches and age spots . give this one a try for any of these aging signs . do n't expect a miracle . the wrinkles will not vanish , but a nice improvement in the look and feel of your skin , a healthy glow that leaves you feeling just a little better about yourself ( and a a great price ) . the formula includes a fast absorbing skin strengthener called vitaniacin ( vit b3 , vit e and pro-vit b5 ) , wheat protein and hydrators . i like it and recommend it ... ..laurie
0	this pillow offers no back support when nursing a baby . i bought a brest friend instead . you can attach that pillow to you and focus on helping your baby nurse instead of supporting your babies entire body . pass up the boppy
0	takes forever to shave - and still does n't get everything - still have to end up shaving with a razor . frustrating - but good concept
1	this product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy . ( be careful not to use too much ! ) it works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer ! not surprisingly , when i use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair : ) i wish it would combat frizz a little more , but my hair is less frizzy when i use it . i guess the next thing i 'll try is the bumble and bumble frizz fighter
1	i always have purchased caruso steam rollers but when i purchased their new ionic roller set it lasted i week and it was almost 3 times the money of the vidal sassoon . this is the best !
0	i like this hairdryer.. when it works ! it has broken twice on me.. the first time it starting spitting out sparks so i sent it back.. they sent me a new one ( of course i had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back ) and now it only works on low , the high is broken.. i am going to throw it out and get a different brand.. not impressed !
1	very compact with good instructions . comes with a very durable case and handle which makes it easily portable . i hope i never have to use it
0	i have very thick , very coarse , wavy hair . when my two year old chi straightening iron broke , i needed to replace it quickly ! locally the only iron i could find was the t3 tourmaline iron , so i thought i 'd give it a try . it cost more than the chi , was sold at a fancy salon , and could even be used on damp hair . surely it would be a good replacement . unfortunately , it failed to impress . -it did not leave my hair silky smooth . while my hair was certainly straighter , it still looked coarse . ( this was on the hottest setting and with several passes over the hair ) -because my hair is so thick , an iron needs to reduce the volume . the t3 failed in this respect , too . -i thought i would like the larger ( almost 2 '' ) iron surface . the t3 has a perfectly flat surface , which made it impossible to get a flip or curl on the ends . needless to say , i returned it quickly to the pricey salon and will be getting another chi ! perhaps this brand would work better for someone with fine hair , since the temperature can be adjusted
0	i was looking to scent an entire room . the lavender is a decent aroma but you need to be within a foot . there were no recommendations on how to spread the scent throughout the entire room so i have to believe that this limited range is normal
1	this is a very good shaver for the private area . however , the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first . this will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work . the foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long . the only problem i had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed . however , i use the 'mangroomer ' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle . it is a great product as well . therefore , i would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men 's grooming on the body . i would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results
1	i just finished a 4 day golf tournament that was brutal . 6 hour rounds played in 90 degree heat with high humidity . during a practice round a couple of days before the tournament started i really got drained of energy after about 12 holes . i was unprepared and it made a sport that i normally enjoy into an unpleasant experience . for the tournament rounds i packed a small cooler with gatorade , nature valley fruit and nut bars , and chocolate flavored clif builder 's bars . i drank water and gatorade throughout each round and alternated the bars every 3-4 holes . it really made a difference . each day i felt like i had the energy and endurance for a great round . if only my golf game was as good as these bars . they tasted great and keeping them in a cooler kept them from melting in the heat . i highly recommend chocolate clif builder 's bars . kevin decke
0	the first one i purchased lasted about 2 weeks , then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working . exchanged it for another one - it lasted about 3 weeks - then the same thing . have now purchased a different brand . would not recommend this product
1	i like this kit very much and my colleague are going to purchase it when they saw mine
0	since our bathroom cabinet is short on space , i loved the idea of this hair dryer ! unfortunately , the idea was more a fantasy than a reality . i only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out ( spring and all ! ) and the retractible cord stopped retracting . since that was the only reason i bought this one over other models , i was sorely disappointed ! also , this dryer is so l-o-u-d that i had to wear earplugs ( no kidding ! ) while drying my hair so that i would n't damage my hearing ! hands down the worst hair dryer on the market
1	i love the tingler ! each metal tip feels great . i personally like the copper version a little better than the silver version . it 's a little gentler and softer but i know some people find it too soft and like the silver version instead . before the tingler , sometimes i would use one end of my glasses ( the end that fits over the ear ) but of course my glasses are fragil and i would risk damaging them . it also feels really good on the back and actually all over , not just on the head
1	i found this product to be very unique , and helpful , in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck . being far-sighted , i have come to need reading glasses , and these are perfect for my needs . i can look 'down ' through them , and look 'over the frame ' for distance , all while they are secured around my head and neck . i do hiking , using a gps device , and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand , while also looking forward towards my path of travel . thank you for the innovative product
1	this toilet paper will never feel like the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis , but it is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find in many public toilets . i am willing to compromise a tiny bit of plush , and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers . i do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a product that makes it `` rapid-dissolve '' , and will in time , try an environmentaly friendly brand . a great option for family with kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage , and ignore the presence of a plunger
0	while the product works it 's good . it was capabable of trimming eyebrows , sideburns , beards mustaches , and that pesty stray nosehair . the problem with the microtouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless . it is not worth the money . buy a product that costs more money and is better quality .
0	i like the idea , but the slippers just are n't comfortable to stand on . it 's great while you are sitting , though
1	i have fought with my naturally curly crazy hair for all of my life..i have tried more products that i care to mention..but i do love this product ! it truly delivers what it promises ... frizz free , loose , non-stiff curls ! i just get out of the shower , towel dry very lightly , put it on and voila ! makes my curls looks sexy !
1	these wipes are awesome ! they got here real fast too !
0	maybe it 's just my bad luck , but i ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery . i called amazon , and they sent me a replacement quickly . the thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same *not working* condition . the same problem with the battery . i was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item , as amazon vendor do n't check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers . be aware ! do n't waste your time
0	i bought 300 and 500 units . they are not working in my small condo . i can not find the place to see how they finally work
0	it worked fine for 2 -3 weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my short hair and it would just stop . i had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again . gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together . very frustrating . go get a professional dryer . it might cost a bit more but it 'll work ! and probably for a long time
1	my grandmother actually gave me a small sample of regenerist . i started to use it and fell in love with it . i have suffered with acne my entire life and i have found combining this along with my salicylic acid treatment my skin has improved drastically . i have since purchased a bottle of the regenerist serum that had a sample of regenerist night . these both seem to be making my skin clear up and be much smoother for applying cosmetics , which has been a problem due to my skin texture
1	this blood pressure monitor is easy to use and works great
1	this is the best dispenser we have used . it attches to the wall easily , is eay to fill and is constructed in such a way that it has multiple uses . we purchased smaller ones to give as gifts-knowing others would like it also .
1	first off , ignore renee 's rating , this woman has issues ! ! ! ! ! ! this toothbrush works great ! would highly recommend .
1	i bought this item because i was going to europe for a month . i did n't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time , unless you buy more than one converter kit . you do need a plug adaptor , ( these are relatively inexpensive ) , then you just switch the voltage , plug it in and it works great . i used it in switzerland , france and italy . when i came home to the states i just switched the voltage back and i now use it at home . it is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase . i would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad
1	for the last 15 years i have been a manual razor user . i decided to try an electric razor and after researching found the norelco 7745x to be just what i wanted . i can say that i am glad i did . it is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy
1	i used to have some remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs . it was n't bad , but sometimes it irritated the skin . my first shaver was my dad 's old school norelco shaver so i thought i 'd give them a try again . the first one i got from amazon was $ 40 ( i forgot the model # ) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee . it was just alright . this one i feel about the same way . i mean it shaves decently , but as an asian male with not much facial hair , i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to . the cleaning system is cool , and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean ( it says you can open it up and run it under water which i 've been doing to clean it ) make it worthwhile to me though . the battery life is also good . if there was a half star system , i 'd give this shaver a 4.5/5
0	this product come with a washer that keep causing the leak . it works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak . now i just leave it in my garage and ca n't return it or use it . very bad investment
0	until i bought several weeks worth of rayovac alkaline d cells , i used duracell alkaline d cells . every week i run a 3-cd changer ( jvc _cx-xc370 ) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes , at the same volume level ( volume # 10 ) , from tuesday to thursday . the duracells lasted all 11 hours ( and might last even longer ) . in contrast , these rayovac d cells for the last three weeks ( maybe four weeks ) have consistently died during the second half of the next-to-last class ( after hour 9.5 and before hour 10 ) .
0	read some reviews that say `` my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day , '' and ask yourself - would n't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day ? ! this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value . if you wo n't drink water and exercise unless you have `` special '' water imbued with mythical powers , than by all means , this is the product for you . but if you prefer to save your money , simply exercise , eat healthier , and drink regular tap water
0	our first unit lasted about almost 2 months . despite the relatively short lifespan , i thought the product was worth it considering the dirt-cheap price . however , the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use ; so , it went back to amazon the very same day it arrived our home . this product is so dangerous . without exercising some safety precaution , it can cause electrocution !
0	amazon and this company are nightmares . i ordered this scale a month ago , and the expected ship date keeps changing . i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever . he was no help at all . after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes , he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade . all he was able to give me was the ship date range , which has already changed several times . amazon needs to drop this from their website if they can not do a better job with getting it out on time
1	had one for the last 2 years until i tore the screen . this is the best shaver i have ever used . shaves fast and clean.its cheap enough that i will buy another one rather than replace the screen . do n't like the charger as it is too easy to knock the shaver off of it
0	when the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit . the power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge . you can not replace the regargable battery yourself ! sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one . as for the shave : not bad , but not exceptional either . the cutters a very tiny , not built to last , and are not durable . all rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used . this shaver may last you a few months - a year , 2 to 3 years will be a stretch . i also have a braun and a norelco , the norelco is 10years old and running fine , the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - i heavy duty clean them in 97 % alchohol about once a year , and brush out debris about once every 7 uses , these units dont have batteries and this is why i purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available . the remington shaver really needs to have it 's cutter blades cleaned ( brushed off or washed ) after every use ( what a pain ) ! i find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last
0	you sent it to the wrong address . i never recieved it.. i spent hours and hours trying to get the address corected.. then i spent hours and days trying to cancell the order.. your customer service rates a d- ! ! ! to say the least . finally i got a credit for the item . but you would n't give me credit for the shipping ! ! i was ripped off .
0	i had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea . it is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong . it literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado . i do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone .
1	for two years i suffered with four herniated discs . physical therapy , a spinal injection , chiropractic adjustments , and many sessions on a spinal decompression machine provided short term relief . i started using the mckenzie method extension exercises , and this offered the most relief . fortunately , i finally discovered the lumbar extender in an internet ad . i noticed that it placed the spine in a similar position as the mckenzie exercises . so , i decided to order the lumbar extender to determine if it would provide better relief than all the other methods i was using . the first two weeks that i used the lumbar extender , i had some minor discomfort . now after five weeks using the lumbar extender , i can honestly say that my back has not felt better in two years . this device does all that it says it will do . i actually enjoy lying on it for two seven-minute sessions each day-one session in the morning and one session at night . when i first used the device , i heard snapping noises in my lower back , probably the spinal facets being repositioned , and then i would experience immediate relief . now i feel as if i have better posture and better curvature to my lumbar region . the cost of the lumbar extender is low compared to a visit to a doctor , and it is worth trying . i highly recommend it
0	this is a very cheap memory foam it reminds me of foam rubber.i have sleep on it for 3 nights and will be removing it for the fourth night . do your home work before you buy this product
1	the dispenser looks good , holds a decent volume of shampoo , conditioner etc . it is simple to refill the bottles , and so far there is no leakage . the mounting was easy , glued onto the tiles with silicone glue ( included ) . if it broke or we decided to replace it , we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles . the top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front , so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head , the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf . the little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads . overall satisfied , good product for the price
1	i used the huggies overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training . i used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull-ups to get him through the night without leaks , but even that did n't work very well . finally , huggies came out with an overnight pull-up - and it really works well ! ! ! excellent product
0	i ordered this product on june 7th 2006 , today is july 11th 2006 , and i still have not received it . i have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it , than to wait over a month for it to show up . i 'm really not happy with the turn around time for the tide he detergent .
1	i 've been using this scrub for a while - it greatly improved the quality of the shave that i get . i get a lot less irritation . i 've also used a similar product from lancome ( more expensive ) and actually prefer nivea better
1	i did a great deal of research on the internet for the `` best '' shower filter . i was concerned about the filter not lasting , losing water pressure , etc . i came across the aquasana on amazon and read all the great reviews on it ... after ordering it , i am so glad that i did . it was really easy to install and i honestly feel like the water pressure coming out of it is better than with my old shower head . the shower head swivels and has several different settings , like massage , rainfall-type flow , etc . it really does feel like you are showering in spring water . just the idea of showering in chlorine-free and mineral-free water is refreshing in itself . i am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone living in an apartment who wants filtered water and who can not install a filter on the main line ... . it 's a little pricy but well worth it .
0	i had such high hopes for this hair dryer -- well-known brand , diffuser with long `` fingers '' just like i prefer , etc . well the first time i used it my hair looked like i had been through a wind tunnel ! the low setting is like most other hair dryers ' high settings , even with the diffuser on . it really blasts the air out ! i have wavy/lightly curly hair and it made my hair a frizzy mess . this dryer may be fine for people with straight hair , but i definitely do not recommend it for people with wavy or curly hair
1	it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores.i do n't know what you mean by give your review a titl
0	after a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine , i purchased this scale . on the unit i received , the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs . the scale i was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit . i have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone . i wanted to see if i was having an impact on body fat so i purchased this scale . when i attempt to use this scale , it errors out with the ol code . perhaps the magazine should retract another article
0	the first few days worked great . i could not finish eating anything , i was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off . i work out daily , count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day . i did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it . i did not lose any weight what so ever . i think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but do n't expect any weight lost .
1	i bought it for my daughter 's birthday . she says it hurts at first but really gets the kinks out . she is very pleased with it
1	i used this product and ca n't say enough good things about it . my friend bought it for me for my birthday and it was fun and easy to use and i lost 30 pounds in 6 months and i was never hungry . i ate at restaurants and always managed to find a perfect menu in my dietmate . i love it . thank yo
1	this is a great product . a friend told me about it . i finally decided to get one . i had bleeding gums . in two weeks of regular use , bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great . just be careful when using the water jet side . you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth , or it will spray all over the place :
1	this shaver is the best shaver i have ever used . it gives me the closest shave . it is very comfortable to hold . it is great . my brother-in-law liked it so much he bought one
0	wo n't even cut hairs you stick directly into the blade . the shape and slots of the housing covering the blade would only cut hair that was as dense as a forest , and then only if you shoved it in hard
0	i ordered the regular size , they were to big , the smaller size ? too small . neither one fit well but both did one thing well , hurt the area under my eyes . buyer beware
1	i saw these here and ordered two pair to get the free shipping deal . i should get a deal where i get a cut of the customers i send them because every day i have my customers ( several each day ) ask me what 's going on with my glasses and where did i get them . i used to go through several pair of reading glasses a month . now i have had these two pair for ... gosh , it 's got to be close to a year now ! they do n't scratch , break , get lost , they 're always right there . i do n't know how i did with out them for so long . get a couple of pairs you 'll love them . oh , one thing when the ladies try them on thier hair does n't always set right with the wrap around thingy . but i do n't know that this ca n't be overcome ... .so ... something to consider
1	this is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used . i had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning . on the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right ! proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night . the only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion , it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face . it feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face . its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower . i cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference . if you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for
0	i bought this lamp because it says it doesnt give off any glare and is easy on the eyes for reading , doing crafts , sewing ... ... ... .. well it doesnt giove off much light either ! ! ! ! so you need another source of light in your work area also ... ... ... i didnt think it would fill up the room with beautiful natural light but c'mon ... ... ... all in all its an overpriced night light ! !
1	i 've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years , both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation , and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed
0	if you have the philip 's sonicare brand electric toothbrush , do n't buy this unit , they do not fit in slots.i had to return mine , and am out shipping , handling , return shipping charges . just an fyi , if your electric brush head is any bigger than a standard size toothbrush , ( diameter ) do n't buy it either , it wo n't fit . they do have a model esa302 that works with the sonicare , but it is alot larger
0	bought this hoping for a good amount of steam for facials and sinus problems.. hardly any steam comes out and there are too many little pieces and parts . not worth the $ $ at all . i 'm back to boiling a large pot of water for steam
0	do n't bother with these . i am a school nurse , and not just this brand , but most brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent , especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal . i had to use the ear type for 8 years between pediatric icu and school nursing . i got pretty good at getting consistent readings , except on very small ear canals , and those with a lot of wax . we got rid of ours and went with an exergen temporalscanner temporal artery thermometer . it takes less time , does n't require probes , and you can get one at costco for $ 30
0	i took passion rx because i am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion . i had great success the first week i took this product . in fact i was so pleased , i bought 2 more bottles . however , the second week , i went back to having no sex drive . and even though i am continuing to take passion rx , it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week . i take 2 pills each day in the morning , and have done so for over a month . i suppose everyone is different but i wo n't purchase any more . plus i just saw a webpage from consumer health digest that gives it low rating compared to other products : http : //consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm ? source=overute/passionrx=passion % 20rx=passion % 20rx=standar
1	for anyone on the fence about these , jump over to my side ; ) my ( then ) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my husband 's permanent black marker . we just bought a brand new refrigerator . i turned my back for a few moments , and when i looked back , she had scribbled *all over* my new fridge . i tried bleach , soap , scrubby sponges ... nothing worked . my first new appliance was ruined ! on a whim i bought this . ( could n't hurt , right ? ) it got it off immediately ! ( i had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves . ) i was so excited , i started running around my house trying to find things to scrub ... i know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease , markers or crayons from walls , and a multitude of other `` sins '' your children may commit against your home .
1	i bought this for my husband . he had a plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but became a callus that gave him pain . emu oil is the first thing that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he had suffered with it for years
1	i love this straightener ! i have had two other straighteners including one from a salon that cost over $ 80 and this one works much better then either of the other two . all my friends also love it and are always asking to barrow it
0	do n't waste your time and money on this product . i have gone thru 3 of these in the last 6 months , two in the last week . all of them have had defective switches . amazon should not sell this product the quality of the switches is unacceptably poor . 3/13/0
1	i have had a couple sets of these , and love them . this set is for a gift . i am so anxious to give it to her
1	i 'm a vain , 39 year old male and started using this product ( in combination with another highly regarded anti-wrinkle product ) about three months ago . this daily application replaced a daily application of facial conditioner/moisturizer . i was hoping some barely noticable forehead wrinkles would go away . no such luck . i notice a definite reduction in wrinkle depth in the morning , before i shower , but by mid-day , the wrinkles have returned to their normal state . does this really work ? ! i suppose the only way to truly find out if this stuff works is to use it on only half the face and see the effect over time . in all fairness , i must mention that my face now routinely feels softer and smoother and less oily than before . that 's why i rated this product a four instead of a three . but the frickin ' wrinkles are still there ! let me see all that clinical research all these skin care experts are touting .
0	my braun thermoscan has given me nothing but trouble . yes this ear thermometer is easy to use . you just have to stick it into the canal correctly . not hard . what i do n't like is you can stick it in the same ear , the same way , 6 different times and get very different readings . everytime i have gone to use my thermometer , the battery would be dead . you have to use the special medical circular batteries , so of course i would never have any handy . then i got smart and started stocking up on the batteries . they are expensive . and everytime i would use it i 'd have to put in a fresh new battery . this also needs the disposable ear covers in order for it to work . yes there is a trick to getting around it but then your thermometer is n't sanitary . finding the covers was sometimes easy and sometimes impossible . i have just never been happy with it . yes it 's easier than the oral ... but i found one even better . try the temporal artery thermometer . you can use that one on a sleeping child
1	in the past , i bought hair dryers at target because of the prices . i had no idea that a few more bucks can buy you a quality hair dryer that surpasses any conair , sassoon , etc . purchased at this and similar stores . the difference in the quality is noticed immediately upon use . although the bb pro is a little heavier than i 'm used to , it dries hair faster and with fewer frizzes . it 's amazing
1	i love this product . in combination with diet and exercise i have lost about 5 pounds , and i was n't heavy to begin with ( all i wanted to do was tone up ) . instead of taking the recommended dosage of 2 capsules twice a day , i am taking 1 twice a day . i figured i 'd take it slow before i get too jittery . but it definitely curbs my appetite . i literally eat half of my usual intake . it gives me energy without making me feel like i 'm wired and i have n't had any shaking hands . i only had headaches for the first 2 days i took this , but now they are completely gone . i will continue to take this even after i reach my goal weight . it 's a great product .
0	this mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification ( 5x ) is not sufficient
1	convenient to use , good battery life , good shave for an electric shaver , but still not as good as a blade . also a little hard to use at edges , such as sideburns , under and around nose
1	this is n't a product thats going to get you laid after she sniffs it a couple of times . it 's starts the chat and dialog . what it does do is start the conversation and keep you the their target . m-11 kicks up the yackity yak in her with you being the focus . i ; ve tried a few of them including that 90 dollar rip off thats advertised in popular science , and this is product works just fine . give it a go guys . it gets you past that awkward dork moment when you are trying to talk about somthing other that what starbucks you hang at . its not a sex pill so forget it . but , it will open up the road you need to walk down to get to the garden of eden or whatever . so do n't be a little whimp . be a man and give it a go . its a way to the women you want via the mental route . yes , you have to think . it will work for you so do it
1	if you wonder why you 're feeling lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches you thought was just advancing age , then you might need probiotic therapy . you might even need it if your resistance to colds is low ! because we live much `` cleaner '' lives than our ancestors did , sterilizing our dishes , putting our food in the fridge , and spraying pesticides on everything , we live our lives virtually bacteria-free . free of the good bacteria , that is . the baddies seem to still get us , and without the good ones to balance them out , we 're in trouble . a lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body . to put it in `` nice '' terms , it 's a little like having backed up plumbing inside you , and the world just ai n't gon na be right until you fix it . i started on probiotic therapy several months ago , and i was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately : *that little stomach paunch went away . i kid you not . talk about an instant self-esteem booster . *my chronic [ men , cover your ears ] yeast infections decreased dramatically ( even without my eliminating wheat from my diet , which i know i ought to do ) . *i had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago . *i became more resistant to colds than i used to be . if you 're considering supplementing your diet with probiotics , you should know that not all of them are created equal . in fact , testing done by www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements do n't deliver the number of live organisms they claim -- not even close ! those little creatures are very delicate , and things like processing , shipping , and sitting on your shelf can kill them . and let 's not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them . primal defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to . ( i can tell from its effects on me . ) in addition , it contains lots of good-for-you green foods that also help build that all-important inner strength . one very important caveat about primal defense , though : because it 's so effective , do n't even think about starting out taking 3 tablets a day ! not unless you do n't mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home . i took one a day for about 2 months , and then i finally felt ready to move up to 2 . it 'll be at least another month before i 'm up to the recommended 3 . one more thing : drink lots of water . you need it anyway , and primal defense works best when you 're well hydrated
1	the lifesource bp monitor was just what i wanted and was priced just right . it was delivered in a timely manner and i am a happy camper along with my wife . thanks .
1	i bought this as a present for my mother but tried it first to be sure it was worth the money . it really is ! after using this the recomended 15 minuets , my feet felt just like they did when i had a professional foot massage ! i highly recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet massaged
1	the lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans from aquis are very soft , absorbant , and they dry quickly . the `` diva darling '' hair towels are not quite as nice . hair turbans stay neatly on your head and are more convenient than a big fluffy towel . if the turban gets sopping wet , that means it 's doing its job ! my parents taught me it 's impolite to come to breakfast without a towel covering my wet hair . this turban is not only great at home , but also in college dorms .
1	the satin finish and the design are very attractive . i had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great . you might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going . the directions , which i lost , said something about priming . installation was easy . it includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips . i went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure . i figured if i ever have to remove it , i could just pull it off and use goof off to remove the adhesive . if you fill one of the chambers with body soap , i recommend neutrogena rainbath refreshing shower and bath gel , original formula and a natural sponge . i bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at wal-mart and it 's a little rough
0	i was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave i was looking for . it also was taking me much longer to shave because i had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs . in the end , after using it for 5 weeks , i took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver . i am back to my razor blade . i still hate shaving
1	i have gotten numerous compliments on this eau de toilette . it has a light , almost woodsy smell . reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or something . classy yet sporting
0	perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality . my experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all . i threw the item in the trash and bought a conair at kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better . my recommendation is do not buy
0	i found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers . i was impressed and eager to try tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them , i ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby . the diapers came sooner then expected , which was great . my single star rating comes from my experience using them . they have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit . it seems like no matter how tight i can get the diapers my son leaks through them , out the sides and up the belly . because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week
0	i purchased the product , used it for 2 days and it has not worked since . the compnay has yet to respond to my request for return , and amazon excepts no liabilty . needless to say i wasted money
1	casein is a great , long-lasting protein , perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey . casein , in general , is bland ( think no fat , no salt , cottage cheese ) , and harder to mix than whey . optimum nutrition has here a decent casein , that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein i 've tried . the price is ok , but i 'd like to see it cheaper ( who would n't ? ) . i mix it with whey and use it throughout the day . i have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor
1	the product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container
1	this is the 2nd year that i have used the neutrogena ultra sheer dry-touch sunblock , spf 45 . i have normal to oily , sensitive , acne-prone skin . i am fair and can burn easily . i think this product is well worth the money , it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel . it does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out . i apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours . the time will vary depending on your sun tolerance , though . it is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile
1	this was my first purchase of seventh generation products and it wo n't be my last one . i was very impressed with the cleaning and it is just as good as those not so earth friendly competitors . i feel good using their products and have also ordered their fabric softner , dishwasher liquid , dishwashing liquid , bleach , paper towels , and toilet paper . i 'm not a treehugger but do care about my environment and feel a duty to make earth a better place to be
0	the nose trimmer works well , but the electric razor not well at all . does not cut at all . i would suggest the nose trimmer but not the razor . the cost was a little high for the product
0	ordered a new pen and pencil set , opened the box only to see `` made in china '' . i dont even want them now
1	this is a great product . i use it on my eyeglasses as well as my computer screen , tv screen . recommend it to al
1	i did n't think i would like the fragrance , but it 's absolutely wonderful . it 's not too sweet or strong . it smells good on my daughters and me . give it a try . you wo n't be disappointed
1	it 's all in your technique ( which took me many trials to learn ) if you have had professional microdermabrassion then you will know how much scrubbing and pressure you will need to apply on your face . the crystals are abrasive and if you do not have the proper techniques you will hurt your face . i use the crystals in pure form once a week ( without the vibrating mechanism ) before bedtime . these are the steps i do that work for me . you may have a different system that might work for you . 1 . thoroughly wash face with cleanser ( i use neutrogena facial liquid soap ) and rinse well . 2 . while still damp , i use crystals to thoroughly exfoliate my face avoiding eye area . i go around in quick circular motion while applying pressure for 1 minute . 3 . i rinse quickly and use neutrogena deep clean cream cleanser to get all the crystals out since crystals are difficult to get out ( it is also soothing ) . 4 . ( its not over yet ) after patting my face dry i follow up by using neutrogena pore refining mask . it 's a cooling gel that you keep on for 5 mins to tighten pores . rinse off and pat dry . 5 . i do not put anything else on my face before sleeping . my face comes out really fresh , soft and smooth . the next morning i just use the cream cleanser to wash .
1	this product is ridiculous ! ! not in a bad way but ridiculous in the fact that my first time taking a serving i felt twice the energy , twice the bloodflow and three times as ready to hit the gym . my first thoughts , `` well maybe it 's because my body is n't used to it yet '' . well , four tubs later i had dropped two pants sizes ( 32 to a 28 ) , gained 15lbs in pure muscle and still have the exact same effects as i did the first serving ! ! not only that , i have passed this little known supplement on to friends and they have all said the same exact thing . omg ! ! i only work out to stay in shape but with this product many people are telling me i look like i workout professionally
1	i get this stuff for my husband . he 's got really thick hair and it has the tendency to get oily but this stuff makes his hair perfectly soft and shiny . it 's worth the money
0	however , after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on . straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from amazon . it is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay . so if you have had good luck with one so far , be glad because i paid for the 2 day shipping could n't wait , and have great disappointment because now i have to return it !
1	i purchased this hairdryer after my professional conair yellowbird from the late 70 's broke . i definitely wanted another conair and i wanted to move into the 21st century ! i did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price . i was n't disappointed . as the other reviewers have stated , this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time ! it 's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are `` dry brushing '' your hair . it does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim . otherwise , it is very solidly built and i hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years .
1	you can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk , though it takes some patience to get things really smooth . i 've used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems . my skin was a little sensitive after the first time , but no terrible pain or anything , and there 's none at all now that i 'm accustomed to using it . it is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving , but if you read the instructions first you should be fine . a couple of very minor drawbacks : it 's rather noisy , more so than a regular electric razor , and if you use the comb attachments , it 's tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time . but that pops right back in , so not a big dea
1	if i could give this product over five stars , i would ! i get eczema on my eyelid and went through tons of products trying to find something to soothe it when i finally got this product in one of the starter kits burt 's bees makes and i was hooked . i use this with their marshmallow vanishing cream and my skin feels and looks great . i have also noticed a decrease in the dark circles i always have when i use the royal jelly cream , though that could just be relief from no more eczema problems
1	pink sugar is a wonderful scent . i have received many compliments on this fragrance . its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey . it is however a sweet scent . everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it . at this price $ 32.14 for 3.4 oz spray you can not find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that . i say buy it you can not go wrong
0	this book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st . 2nd , and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages . so this book wasnt worth what i payed for it
0	i just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one i had for years . i read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices , price being the primary concern . the saying you get what you paid for is true ! ! the heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap . pay more and be happier
0	thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush , but no . my hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight . the brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush . so , i could n't get the full volume results i wanted . i can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better . it is very loud though . i returned mine
0	the mirror did not work , the lights and clock did not work and i did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up , i would have to get a new box and take it to the ups place to send it which would have cost me about another $ 10 and quite frankly , it was just not worth the time nor the money
0	i gave this item as a gift . so i was disappointed when after only a few months of use , it was broken . i 'm not sure what happened , but my haircutter has lasted for years
0	i bought this apple humidifier in early november . it stopped working soon at the first time i used it . i later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again . you have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working . i contacted the manufacturer and got replacement . however , the new one has the same problem , and what 's worse , it leaks ! ! i talked to the manufacturer again , but they did n't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else . now i have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do
0	the flexible arm is not stiff enough to support the dry weight of the showerhead . this is the most pathetic product that i have seen in decades
1	happy with price and product . very very easy to use ; fast and accurate
1	compared to the first humidifier i got from walmart , this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect . oh , well i just got it yesterday so it 's too early to say perfect , but considering others ' reviews , i am pretty confident that i am gon na love it longer than at the first sight . the only thing is i do n't know where to put it . the power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long . i am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest , or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time
0	using this on my legs feels like electric shocks because of how it pulls and chews . i would n't dare use it on my underarms . very poor shaver ! !
1	my wife had high bp , so we got this model . the reasons for choosing this model were that : 1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models 3 . omron seems to be one of the better/best brands . 4 . supposedly , the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking . the unit appears well built ( including the hand pump ) . it is easy to operate , and it seems very accurate . we checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home , and the automatic unit at the drug store . we find it takes very accurate and consistent readings . people with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient . also , people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff . i 'm overweight right now , so the cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife 's nicely ( it was bought for her )
1	heats up quickly . tends to dry out more than previous chi flat iron i had . much more economical
0	not the pumps described even though i tried everything else . i found that taking whey protein isolate at 200grams per day worked better at giving me a pump during my workouts .
0	we have only had this showerhead for one month . already the nozzles are clogging . the spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall . do not purchase this product if you have hard water
0	this is a very lousy product ; the lighting around the mirror is absolutely useless ; when you turn the light on , it seems like you 're still looking at the mirror with no light ; awful product ; eventhough it 's cheap but it does n't even worth a dime
0	bayer is a name-brand aspirin . any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin . i give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product , rather , because it is so expensive . the dosage is 81 mg , taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes ( generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis , have had a heart attack or stroke ) . aspirin is a wonder-drug , the very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago . it is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , and even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other , thus it `` thins '' the blood and prevents blood clots from forming . aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes . some folks take a `` baby '' aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day to prevent blood clots from forming . aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion , to make digestion easier . some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people , but some can not take it without severe stomach upset . for these folks , the buffered form is a god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out of favor in the 60 's and 70 's when reye 's syndrome developed in some children ( under the age of 16 ) who took aspirin while they had the flu and/or chickenpox . about 30 % of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage . because of reye 's syndrome , alternate analgesics were placed on the market , the premier being tylenol . there is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult , as reye 's syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age . the usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg , with the `` extra-strength form at 500 mg . most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5,200 mg. ( some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg/day with a doctor 's supervision ) . there is no additional benefit to taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours . increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin . aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications , those with stomach ulcers , and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics . allergies can develop to aspirin as well . never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , such as ibuprofen , as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased . do n't mix aspirin with alcohol either , as it is hard on the stomach . used properly , aspirin is a terrific medication . i prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form . one pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer . however , the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better . jim `` konedog '' koenig
0	item does not look any thing like the picture . it is flat . i do n't feel any difference when i am setting for long periods of time
0	i recently bought 3 items from this brand - lumiscope . actually this is the only item that works among them . though i am kind of suspicious about it 's inconsistent readings from time to time . i think braun irt452 is a much better product , which i bought one for my parents in china . during sars epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings .
1	i used the remington twice up to now , and the bottom line it is a great machine , you will never need to lube it , and that is a big deal with clippers . its easy to clean , sharp and easy to work with
0	it 's a gimmick . looks good on tv , does n't do what it says . i 'm embarassed to admit i even tried it
1	i purchused this for my daughter with vision then my vision impaired daughter used it while she was at home she loved it , so now i 'm buying her one for her new ap
0	i purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models , since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat . the scale part works normal , but the body fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30 % , compared to tanita bc554 scale or omron hbf-306c hand held . omron , replaced the unit , but the new one is also inaccurate . now , i 'm tying to get my money refunded , but omron does not want to take the unit back
0	my rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set , regardless of me using more or less hair . maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio . if so it is impossible to find . i dunno , but i do know i would not recommend these . also even when i get these to stay in my hair , my hair does n't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers . overall buy something else
0	i figured for the price , how could you go wrong ? well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether . no hot air , no cold air ... nothing ! ! this item looks like a great deal..but save your $ $ $ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1/2 months . the manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product !
1	i 've used this razor for about 2 yrs . for me and my wife , it gives me a great close shave . i 've never had a problem with skin irritation . just how hard are these other guys pressing the razor on their face ? ! i ca n't imagine . i only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave . the shave is fast , about 2 mins . the dual blade design ( each of the three heads has two rows of blades ! ) is awesome , makes the shave clean and fast . i 'll probably stick with remington rotories from now on , but will upgrade to a corded/cordless . my problems with it are : ca n't use with cord if the battery dies ( did n't know this when i bought it ) the gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in , which requires turning it off and back on again . otherwise , it 's a great solid razor
1	these glasses are a great idea . however , they do not work with long hair . the back `` strap '' of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose ( so you can see over them for distance ) . long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back , making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes . i guess most people who need reading glasses do n't have long hair
1	oral b has always been top notch for me and this 8900 dlx is just fantastic . my teeth are so bad the dentist always called me the plaque king lol but after 6 months on this i went to the next cleaning and they saw a huge improvement . he calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha i have been putting this thing to the test for about a year now and i love it ... i keep it on the spinning setting which really works well . do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth , you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but its still a top notch product . thanks oral b ! !
0	i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it 's retractable cord and folding capabilities . even the price was attractive . it really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus . i thought i had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly . now for the bad news : the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time . then , the folding handle , low and behold , broke in half one morning . ( of course , the warranty had long expired ) . this dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and i consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers . when i 've replaced hair dryers in the past , it was been because they 've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out . i 'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone , while very appealing , can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer 's lifespan . i 've now purchased a t3 tourmaline ( a featherweight , quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle ) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan .
0	this piece is compact and convenient where power outlet is not available . running with 3 aaa batteries , the stream is too weak to do the cleaning . not recommend for buying
1	i can say before i started to use this product i was always afraid of wearing white clothings but tide to go has totally changed everything . initially i thought this was just a gimmick but i thought it was worth a try , ... soo ... i bought it with me during our two-week trip with my parents in august..and it came handy ... my dad bought a brand new white jacket and had it put on immediately and then decided to drink a cup of coffee..unfortunately , he spilled the coffee on the white jacket when he tried to open the lid to put sugar in it ... my mother immediately wiped the coffee off with napkins..the coffee stain , however , was still there ... then..i remember i had put a tide-to-go in my purse ... i immediately used it on all coffee stains on the white jacket ... and to my surpise , all the brown spots resulted from the coffee spill were gone ... amazing..i have used this on different kind of food stains . i 've used it on coffee stain , spaghetti sauce stain , juice stain and they all worked . my mother , my mother-in-law , and my sister-in law they were all so amazed at the result that they all asked me for one to carry with them . nowadays i do n't leave home without one in my purse..i used to be afraid of wearing white clothings , i am no longer afraid of wearing whites because of tide-to-go..this is definitely a useful product to carry with you everywhere you go..oh..as far as the smell goes..the smell is bearable to me ... and in order to use it you have to push it down to get the actual fluid to flow out through the tip of the tide-to-go marker .
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head , they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head . another thing , they did not look cool at all , they were ridiculous looking , nothing like the photoshopped pictures
0	i bought this shaver last september , and at that point i agreed with the other reviewers . it delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use . this past may , it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely . i only used the recommended cleaning solution , changed it according to the instructions , and cleaned it after every use . i sent the shaver back to remington , they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks . it worked wonderfully , for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again ! i 'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time , it is n't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver !
0	this protien works well to curb my appitite for hours on end , but it has a horrible taste and texture . the closest thing i can relate it to is chocolate-burned egg tasting boogers . i would not purchase this product again . i would , however , purchase from the vender again because it is not their fault that this protien tastes so bad
0	meditation will do the same thing . buy a tape or take a class
1	great and accurate . it is a pleasure to use . best monitor available
0	it worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working . changed the batteries to no avail . it 's very pretty , but i have a less attractive old tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years
0	i guess it 's cheap , but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight , so it 's pretty hard to get anything more than a ~2-3 pound estimate . which is fine if you 're not obsessive , but most people care about that increment ...
1	i really liked this product . i am a late 30 's woman whose skin is basically pretty good . i have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads , but even before i bought the neutrogena microdermabrasion i would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is . but around age 35 i looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it . unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion , i decided to try the neutrogena at home system . the neutrogena microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply . the cream had the slightest pleasant smell , and was not sticky at all . i used well less than a teaspoon , so a little goes a long way . it was no problem to rinse it off my face with water , and the sponge was very easy to clean as well . the treatment took me less than 10 minutes , fit in easily to my bedtime routine , and after the initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week . my skin definitely felt softer , smoother and more invigorated . i could notice a difference after only one treatment . but the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that i looked younger . ( he did n't know about the microdermabrasion . ) and even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty . there was a clear and noticeable difference -- after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow , and the few large pores i have did appear smaller . being lazy , i have not incorporated it into my regular routine like i should , but i do pull it out a few days before special occasions , vacations , or anytime i feel the need for a little brightening up , and will definitely always keep it on hand . if you have particularly sensitive skin , this may not be a great product for you , as it is a bit , well , abrasive . for me , it was a painless process , and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow
1	this product works great for water retention . i like that it does n't keep you running to the ladies room , works great
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews . i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual . the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use . i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse . i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal . do not buy this product
0	i purchased this table from another vendor -- the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off . it also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support . the table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top . i promptly returned this table
0	as an esthetician i would advise against using these sort of products . they basically sand your face off . please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals . i can assure you that i am not just saying this to drum up business . i would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this . you initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation , but believe me , you will pay for it in the long run . the main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide ( also referred to as corundum ) , which is characteristically known for its hardness , and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools . this material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the mohs scale of mineral hardness , making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness . you may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures , but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon , dermatologist , or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment . i see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products , and they all have the same issue ; it worked great at first , then after some time they started to notice that it was n't working as effectively , so they used it more often and harder . exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right . when this process is done more often than necessary , or in an overly aggressive manner , you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation . people do n't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason , it 's there to protect and moisturize our skin . when you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin , you are doing more harm than good . over stripping the skin causes irritation , break-outs , and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed . when your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation , it 's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection . so please , if you do use this , use extreme caution , do n't use it on your face , and do not use it more than once a week , if that . ask any esthetician , plastic surgeon , or dermatologist out there and they 'll tell you the same thing : there is a reason people do n't get facials , chemical peels , and microderm every day , or even more once a month . the adage `` too much of a good thing '' stands true here . if you need more convincing , please refer to the following links and make the decision your self .

1	i bought this item last month from amazon.com for $ 149 . i thought it is using some kind of hand-like massage motors , and not those vibration motors . when the item arrived and i setup , i found out they are using the vibration motors ! a little disappointed i am . but i use it , it is not bad if you do n't mind the vibration motors . the heat feature is great . however , the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position is n't holding well . the leather-like material really feels like a lether . the vibration really vibrates the whole floor , so i suggest to put on carpetted areas only . i personally like the hand-like massage chair better . but this $ 149 chair is worth the price . others would sell for over $ 300
0	after two months my conclussion was that i could see no change what-so-ever . typically neutrogena is quality , but not this time . now you ca n't say you were n't warned
1	this product works well , it takes a while to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets going .
1	i really like these things . they 're certainly chewy , so they can be a bit of a jaw workout , but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar , and they keep you going for a couple of hours . if only they were a little cheaper , say a dollar or less per bar , i 'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than i do right now
0	the very first thing i noticed was how small and crammed the case was . it was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something . the other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was . the bonnnet was difficult to get on , mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place , and kept pulling the bonnet off my head . after a couple of trys and reading the instructions , i knew i would never use it , simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head . whoever designed this product should be demoted
1	i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair . it works great ! i got ta admit , it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the `` extra large '' size towel ( which is n't really all that large .
1	i got this showerhead for christmas and am really happy with it ! ! it 's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you . i do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place . but with mine anyways it stays in place while i 'm using it and it 's only later that it slowly lowers down . then i just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when i want to use it . it has n't been any trouble so far . i love this showerhead so much that i 'm actually already looking for an even larger one ! ! i highly recommend these `` rainfall '' showerheads !
1	having had perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , and most of my 30s , i now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36 . my skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out of desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks , i have found that it works well , with some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising to surface , becoming a hideous scab , etc . ) in a fraction of the normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated as directed with zeno , or it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface ( after a week or so ) , when treated very aggressively with zeno . my advice : do n't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised . do know that with diligence and patience , it will work . be very aggressive . do double-cycles ( allow the zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps , then press the button for a second cycle ) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way . you may get very slight burning of your skin ( causing a whitish film or slight peeling ) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it 's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne . i am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition , and seeing the results i have hoped for after 2 weeks
0	my wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray . with all of the snow we have had , it arrived shortly after christmas , but just in time to warm her heart for the new year
1	i have a preemie who 's temperature needs to be monitored pretty much constantly . at every diaper change we were taking axial temps with one of those standard digital thermometers . torture ! took forever and baby screamed her head off the whole time . then my sister got this thermometer for us and it is fabulous . what we like : 1 . when baby is screaming , the light blinks and then goes solid when temp is done , great when you ca n't hear the beep . 2 . it truly does take a second unless baby is thrashing about . 3 . produces a long beep when you are taking your own temperature , no guesswork about when it 's finished which is an improvement over earlier models . what we do n't like : 1 . preemies have tiny ear holes . so we have had to wait till our baby 's ear was big enough to be able to use this thing . 2 . the lens covers are a pain to switch out and keep on hand , it would be nice if there were a way to just sanitize the lens after each use . 3 . we see a discrepancy of almost one degree between the left and right ear which makes us question the accuracy somewhat . the enclosed brochure explains various causes of this , but that does n't help when trying to determine what exactly your baby 's temperature is . we have done both the axial and ear temp and found that the right ear on our baby corresponds with the digital thermometer 's reading on her armpit . however , the enclosed chart shows the variances between oral , rectal , axial , and ear temperatures which make it somewhat confusing . so we alternate between the digital and the ear thermometer just to be sure . i personally would recommend this thermometer for older babies and kids , just be sure that you test it out when kids are healthy to figure out your baseline and what is normal . it takes some investigation to develop your method based on what your needs are , but it is a nice , quick to use product and my family loves using it for adult temperature readings . we think we will be happier with it when baby is bigger and we are using it for sick readings only
0	the razor i bought came with packets of this gel , as well as the lotion . possibly due to the consistency , the gel gets used up more quickly . it is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is . the key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol . the gel has menthol , so that 's why it can be irritating . i read a review of shaving basics online , and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol . the lotion , on the other hand , always helps get a better shave , and is quite soothing
1	nearly two years of ownership and it has been a great purchase . i have no shame dorking up my drinking . use to ensure legal driving or for ill advised contests . also determine what at what bac memory gets spotty ( what point is there exceeding that ? ) . fun to call out big talkers who do n't suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts . also useful to get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive . pros precision to third decimal place . rare at this price at time of my purchase very repeatable with consistant deep breath small enough to take to bars in jacket pocket or cargo pockets . light for its size . cons innaccurate if sips have been taken within 10 minutes or so . true for all breathalyzers . drunk idiots have tough time getting it through their heads warm up/calibration time ~45 sec . another let down at parties but perhaps key to accuracy would be nice if it was more pocket sized chirps at you alarm clock style if above .08 `` i know i 'm drunk , shut up !
0	this is a very cheaply built product . we had a hard time getting it to mist at all . even though the instruction say fill it with water at least 1 inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at . when it did mist it would not get more than about 1/3 inch from the top . so , the mist never made it out of the bowl . we did like the changing color lights
1	i am very satisfied with my purchase of the wooden foot roller massager . it gives you a relaxed feeling for sore and tired feet.i discoverd that if you turn it on the other side , you can also use it on your arms and legs by holding it
1	i was very suprised at how small the units were ( i ordered 2 ) . but they work great and run very quietly . the filter is very easy to change . i have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that i switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space . i would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money
0	cheap product in all means . it riped off my hair while straightening and did a very lousy jo
1	i bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband . after the first night i knew i wanted one to put in our rv too . my husband complained about the smell when i unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years . he had me order one for his sister for christmas . i thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now i have purchased four ! this is a wonderful product . i would recommend it to anyone
1	very convenient reading glasses . you could hang them on your neck when not using them , and not even notice they are there . they are very sturdy , and are flexible making them almost imposible to break . cons : both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side . they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face . the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair , as the glasses would trap your hair against your face
0	i have always thought that a man 's shaver would work on woman 's beard . this one does not .
1	the first epilator that i used was the epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80 's . i did not use this for long ... . a tool of complete torture ! i finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from `` veet '' which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that i was completely hooked on using an epilator . good-bye razors and wax ! i figured that if a single roller did a good job that the conair which had two rollers would do even better . the conair does a good job and i 'm keeping it as my spare , but the epilator from veet actually does a better job . i no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and i even do my bikini area and underarms . i love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing . once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over . update : i 've had more time to use the conair epilator and now i 've actually been using it more than my `` veet '' . just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it . as a matter of fact i am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends
1	dr. scholl 's foot cream was excellent . it 's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell . my feet felt softer in the morning after using it at night and i noticed a difference immediately in my dry , cracked heels . i also ended up using it on my hands and elbows before i went to bed . especially my hands were really soft in the morning . i 've tried other foot creams and not been really impressed . but i think the difference is that dr. scholl 's has no alcohol in it , and it 's really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your skin
0	i 've had this for about a month , and i 've used it less than 6 times . even though i 've carefully handwashed it , and merely wiped off the ice ring , the ice ring has sprung a leak ( ewww , blue liquid on my celery ! ! ) . the lid is difficult to snap on/remove . the center container/lid is really too tall for its diameter , which makes using it for dipping rather awkward
1	i have dry , course hair that certainly gets even drier in the colorado climate . i have used this product on and off for 10 years and just love the way it defines and adds shine to my hair . i can see if you had fine hair that this product would not be a good thing ! i always have to remember that it 's the anti-humectant that i like , not the humectant . the humectant version does nothing for my hair and i have purchased it on occasion by mistake . this stuff smells great too ! makes styling a snap
0	i really dun know if i was expecting too much out of this machine ... but its not really that great ... there are just one or two sounds that u may like..like the running stream , heartbeat , tropical forest etc..the rest of them like the ocean waves , rainfall ... thunderstorm ... white noice ... etc pretty much dont let u sleep ... also someone complained here about the alarm ... what alarm ? ? ? ? ? thats a different model which is about $ 20 ... this one is just the sounds ... .which sound artificial ... if u are expecting a more natural sound ... move on ... this one is more like a radio with too much static !
1	forget the liquids and throw away lens tissues . this cloth works exceptionally well on my camera lenses . i highly recommend it , and am buying a couple more , for my car glove compartment for sunglasses and my computer screen .
1	i purchased this for my husband as a gift without ever having smelled it . i based my purchase on other reviews , and the fact that i have the burberry classic for women and love it . i crossed my fingers and hoped that the reviews were right . well , they were ! when this came in i could not resist ; i had to open the box . i pulled the outer wrapping back , carefully pulled the box out ( i was able to replace all this without hubby knowing ) , sprayed some into the air , and `` ahhhh '' , wonderful ! i loved it ! it smells wonderful on my husband , too . it 's kind of woodsy , but not overpowering at all . it 's a classic , warm fragrance , and it lasts a long time . i will definitely buy this again
0	amazon and this company are nightmares . i ordered this scale a month ago , and the expected ship date keeps changing . i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever . he was no help at all . after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes , he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade . all he was able to give me was the ship date range , which has already changed several times . amazon needs to drop this from their website if they can not do a better job with getting it out on time
1	i have always dated men who wear this cologne . not on purpose but i always seem to find or smell men who wear this scent . my mother calls it sex in a bottle . the scent is light and pleasant but still smells like a man should smell
0	the photo of this product is extremely beautiful and its supposed functions are very attractive , so i bought it even though the existing reviews are mostly negative . well , the reviews are right . this product arrived unassembled . i stared at the obscure instruction and the parts that does not seem to be able to hold in any way for a good couple of minutes , and decided this is not for me . and by the way , without the beautiful blue light showing on the photo , this thing looks like a lifeless vase made of pale glass . as i re-pack this thing back , i noticed that it has actually been opened and re-sealed before . that means someone bought it and decided to return it as well . that says a lot about this product .
1	i ordered this as a gift and it arrived in less than a week ... with their standard shipping ! the produict was exactly as described . shalimar is a classic
1	i take two of this product before bed and it relaxes me and helps me sleep
1	i purchased this size ramp to handle wheelchair access over the two-inch threshold to our house and it has done that , but i wish now that i had selected a size longer than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline . i use a power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the chair 's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the top of the ramp due to the slope , necessitating careful maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house . it was easy to install , however , with the included mounting screws and seems sturdy and durable
1	this is the last hair straightener you will every buy . heats up quickly and straightens long , thick and even curly hair in minutes . have n't stopped receiving compliments since i started using it .
1	well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids , but i find it perfect for me . it 's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber , what more can you ask for
0	this is my first purchase that i have been unhappy with . the tingler arrived with two of the tingles off . attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful . i had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response . i would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address . jon fresh 2716 ne lorie dr. hillsboro , or 97124 . the tingler was to be part of a massage christmas gift for my wife . i would appreciate your time in this matter . thanks , jon fres
0	purchased this machine for my wife ( born 1949 ) who has high blood pressure ( 150+/90+ untreated ) and type-ii diabetes . had high hopes as this was not a drug-related therapy . but was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results . yes , she enjoyed using it . but her blood pressure was not improved . here is my analysis for your consideration . if your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life , resperate may work for you . but there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis . so , carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying
1	this shaver replaced a norelco advantage ( 6 years old ) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days . i ca n't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because i have n't shaved with a blade in many years . i have used foil shavers in the past ( braun and panasonic ) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it . i have been using this shaver for about 3 months . during that time i have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day . at first i thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought was doing a great job . it shaves quick and close ( personally i think as close as a blade ) . when you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry . it does n't get any easier than that . i have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too . the only con is i have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings . use electric shave before shaving and i think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation . highly recommended and worth the price .
1	i needed something to help me maintain my short hair inbetween barber shop appointments and this is a good thing to buy . my fiancee helps me keep the maitenence between my appointments
1	we use these in all of our humidifiers and they do a great job
1	b styling creme is absolutely the greatest hair product i have ever used . thanks for making it available on line
1	received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the free ship option . shop-rite sells individual box for 8.99 , so even the regular price of $ 32 beat that . the $ 10 additional promotion was icing on the cake
0	this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best . when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0. the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs . give or take a few from clothes ... i was extremely shocked ! how could i weigh that much ! ! turns out the scale was off approx . 20 pounds 20 pounds !
1	this omron blood pressure monitor is ok , but not as good , in my opinion as my old one from the same company . this one does n't print out results , although it does store them . also , the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome .
1	i looked long and hard for a heating pad that did not need plugging in or hot water poured into it . this is perfect - just zap it for two minutes in the microwave and set it where the you need it ... ahhhh ! pure happiness ! a definite must have
1	i 've been using nicads for long , long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer ... the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units , gps , walkie-talkie 's , flashlights , etc . however , these newer nimh are just great . no memory shelf and longer current life . nicads and alkaline 4 stars these do get a
0	this product is worthless . save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else . i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank . i 'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in
1	the shampoo does n't lather . but it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day . and it seems to be doing it 's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch-free since i started using it . so i would recommend it
1	it is really great ! ! ! sure , it does hurt , but not any more than waxing . i do not shave because i get cut very easily . this is a great alternative to expensive waxing . even when i have more hair it works . i would buy this product again , and again
0	i was so excited about this product ; but when i got it i was deeply dissatisfied . the box was damaged . it was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides . i will be returning this product for a replacement . i do think that the box is really cute . however if i receive another damaged box then i will never buy another thing from this website
1	i loved it and guys really love it . the smell is so fresh and clean .
1	after 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise , numerous doctor visits without results , i obtained source of life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them . with the very first dose , i went from dragging around to walking around -- while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen . at my very next doctor 's appointment , i told of my experience with source of life and i continue to report it to anyone and everyone that mentions being excessively tired . members of my family and several friends now regularly use this outstanding product , and have reported similar results . not only did i feel much better with higher energy levels , i also notice fingernail and hair growth as well . i use the liquid version and it is actually very tasty . i highly recommend this product . i 've used it for 3 years and have obtained consistent good results .
0	be sure to measure your arm before purchasing ... it 's annoying to receive the unit with the standard adult arm cuff ( fits arms 9 to 13 inches around ) and find out i have to order a larger arm cuff ! do n't bother calling omron `` customer service '' at 1-800-634-4350 ... just a typical big company voice mail hell ! it even tells you to call another number to order the piece ... my 1 star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and omrons `` customer service
1	i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time
0	i got this as a gift for my husband . he used it for about 3 weeks , but still had red marks , and had to follow up afterwards with a regular `` disposable '' razor . the whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and was n't as good . luckily , braun had a 30 day money-back guarantee , so we were able to return it ( minus shipping x 2 )
0	i bought this straightener because everyone said it was wonderful and it was at a great price ... but looks can be decieving ! ! this straightener pulls my hair , it does n't get very hot , it 's kind-of uncomfortable to hold , and it does n't straighten my hair ! ! !
0	it 's good for its purpose but not resistant . the lock that close the ball broke in the first use when i tried to open . the other one worked fine . it 's a cheap plast material , could be better and more resistant . but for now it 's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras . besides , this product is for medium and small bras . who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc
0	what a disappointment - the reviewer who mentioned the difficult-to-use switch was right , it was a poor design choice . needlessly heavy too , with poor balance
1	i 've been using 2 of these batteries in my walkman for 10 hours now and they are still going very strong . it 's living up to its reputation as described so far .
1	this is one of the best-tasting energy/snack bars i 've tried . it has true flavors ( think a chewy chocolate brownie with small chocolate chips ) , little or no `` off '' flavors or aftertastes , and it 's relatively filling , especially if accompanied by water or an additional quick snack , such as fruit . it 's a small bar , but it 's packed with 3 grams of fiber ( 12 % of daily needs based on a 2,000 calorie diet ) , and it 's certified 95 % organic . these organic ingredients include organic rolled oats , organic oat flour , organic oat fiber , organic and milled flaxseed , and actual natural flavors . even the sweet stuff is organic : , including organic chocolate ( made with -- you guessed it -- organic evaporated cane juice ) , soy butter , cocoa powder , cocoa butter , tapioca syrup , and fig paste . clif 's website proclaims that `` clif zbar is the first kids ' snack created to comply with sb-19 , california 's senate bill limiting fat and sugar in foods offered within the state 's school system ... we source ingredients which do not contain wheat and are not genetically engineered .

0	pedometer part is fine . radio part is useless
1	we love this item ! ! ! we get older tv show dvds from netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come . if the cleaner does n't work , and it generally does , our back up is the repair stuff , which almost always does . i think out of 30 disks , only two were not fixed .
1	i had bought a tingler elsewhere for $ 20 , plus shipping , so when i saw this one advertised for $ 9 , i was a bit hesitant that it was n't the real tingler , but a cheap knock-off ( especially since they show no picture ) . but , i decided to risk it and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is not only the real tingler , it is also shipped in a pretty velvet pouch for wonderful gift-giving . amazon , of course , also offers free shipping for $ 25 or more , so i bought 3 and got them all shipped free ! great deal ! and , by the way , it is incredible ! it really did send little shivers down my spine the first few times i used it . while you sort of get used to the feeling after a while and the little shivers may disappear , it still feels fabulous on your head
0	just used this razor for the first time . could not get a close shave out of it at all . the trimmer will cut hair but not stubble . on top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash . i 'm very disappointed in this razor but i guess i got what i paid for . i 'm going to order a new razor right now because i ca n't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary
0	all i wanted was a bottle that i could use to mix y protein but this stupid things leaks every time because the lid doesnt fit right . you 'd think something with only one purspoe would adequately fill that role ... . well in this case it does n't
0	this straightener is great for thin hair ... but not for thick . i myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy . the best hair straighteners out there are about 1 thick or less and they normally have glass plates . so if you have thick hair , spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality
0	oh fusion razor , fusion razor , gleaming long and bright . bring to the growth upon my face your buzzing , five-blade might ! your contours sleek and overformed , your gripping action steady . your shaving power manifold , t'would make a weak mind heady . what thoughtfulness lies 'neath your shine ? you gleam like spaceship rubble ! and with your `` future now '' design , you lay waste to my stubble ! too bad you lay waste also to the skin beneath the hair . now i bemoan the scabby strokes that mar my visage fair . purring like a happy tiger that stalks its helpless prey , with your five and shining claws , my face you swiftly flay . our first few dates were sweet as silk , your touch was oh-so-gentle . but by date three you bit and chewed , you 've proven tempermental . oh , fusion razor , fusion razor , why have you done me wrong ? although you 're mighty , it 's too bad my skin is not as strong . why do i keep on giving you a chance to find redemption ? what razor god hath granted thee such epiderm exemption ? oh , no more , no , my razor friend , your doom is clearly written by tributaries crimson red that on my cheeks you 've smitten . i wondered when i purchased you , just what the `` fusion '' meant . now i think it marks the meld 'twixt shaves and punishment . `` the leading edge of science ! '' `` the future is today ! '' `` the greatest shave technology ! '' your advertisements say . technology 's not always good . although it 's what life 's built on , it also causes wars and monsters ( much like paris hilton ) . i need no buzzing , layered mesh of steel that swiftly flails . i think i 'd rather shave myself with dull lee press-on-nails . so , adieu , my fusion razor , do n't leave in dour depression . take comfort in that tho ' your banned , you still left an impression
0	when i bought this i had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster . it does n't cut it for a few reasons : 1 . solution left a streaky , dull floor . mop glo with water works much better . 2 . bottle only lasted 3 times for a very small kitchen . 3 . need to put batteries in the device ( something i did n't realize when i bought it ) . 4 . not `` cleaner than a mop . '' if you have a heavy-traffic floor like i do , you 'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around . a mop at least can be rinsed . 5 . bottle is impossible to refill . i might have stuck with it if i could have replaced the solution with a water/mop glo mix , but they have the bottle fixed so you ca n't . *sigh* i 'm actually considering spending the $ $ $ for a `` scooba . '' we have a roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream . if you want something fast , stick with `` swiffer wet . '' no batteries , no solution to refill
0	i ordered it because i have a couple friends that love it . well , i really do n't care for it . and now i ca n't find the return sticky label to return it and i 'm really bummed about that because it cost $ 55 ! ! maybe if you could help me with that , that would be great ! thanks beck
0	gillette has a quality control problem with the blades . this is a recent problem , but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to schick disposable razors . the gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face . the blue strip degrades after only a few shaves , and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face .
0	paid a fortune for this thing and it stopped working after 2 uses
0	i travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and i needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers , so after some research i decided to purchase the travel-size t3 . during the first time i used it , it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire . ( there were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out ) i took the dryer back to sephora and i was quickly given a replacement . while i had dryer # 2 , i noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair , when it usually takes 20-30 . however , i have the full size t3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when i use that one . i was expecting this to offer the same power as the other t3 . the bottom line is that i did n't notice a big difference between the travel t3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms . after 6 months , the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use . if you want a great hairdryer , buy a full size t3 , elchim or chi pro -- if you need something to travel with , you 're better off with finding space for the full size model .
0	i 've used the cardiochek 6 times , and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor 's office during the same period . my cholesterol levels according to the doctor 's tests are always around 200 . with the cardiochek they vary by as much as 90 points . it is a lot of trouble ( and expensive ) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and triglycerides . no test strips are included in the package when i purchased the cardiochek . the box says `` includes check strips '' but those are something other than test strips
1	it took a while to get this product but , it was worth the wait . the iron heats up quickly and easily . when you have arthritis like me , you appreciate the simplicities in this product . it heated up fast and safely and it was so easy to grip the handle . it definitely styled my hair without over-processing it . thanks
1	it arrived in 3 days and i used it for a week , and i still get some stray ingrowns once in a while but it is the only thing that worked this good this fast for me and trust me i tried everything in the book . a plus is my face is one even complexion when i had alot of dark spots which was a pleasant surprise
1	i use these glasses all the time at work . they sure are handy . glad i bought them
1	i had my original clic readers for about six years before i had to replace them . i love the quality of the lenses , the ease of use and the fact that i do not have to remember where i put them when i took them off . i never take them off and have even ordered several pair for other people at work . i am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that accumulates on them once in a while , find them to be one of the most useful tools i own .
1	fantastic , a great product , especially considering the price . i love the size . i love that the height is adjustable . it is exactly what i wanted , and i am thrilled with it .
1	they do n't seem small at all . i would agree that it 's like a size 3 , if you 're talking about toddler clothing , but the diaper size is different . my daughter wears 3t clothes , size 5 easy ups
0	absolute waste of money . i bought this for my 13-year-old as a beginner shaver and it shaves next to nothing ! i do n't know who wrote the other reviews , but i doubt they were independent voices . this shaver is worthless
0	way too expensive for little in return . the same size piece of dark chocolate with the same calorie content would be just as filling . [ ... ]
1	the filter is small compared with most other systems ; has a sturdy , metal fixture and pull-knob activator ; filters quickly with plenty pressure ; and of course it has the great culligan taste
0	i found this razor as the same as the other ones . do n't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one . the only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose , et
0	one i started using the shaver it fell apart . it has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just do n't work . the shaver is a waste of money
0	do n't buy this ! i regret that i did n't listen to the people who left feedbacks . the craftmanship for this item is very bad . not only the product was made of cheap plastic , it was missing a screw too . i would not recomment this product
1	i have been using this line of products since they were marketed . my plastic surgeon ( not used for facial needs ) keeeps remarking on my skin and has to remind himself that i am 61 !
0	fall asleep in minutes what a joke.don`t waste your money on this product
1	my husband was leaving more than 20 pairs of reading glasses everywhere and any where and could still never find a pair when he needed them ... .even to ead a menu ! these glasses are the answer to anyone who wears reading glasses . i bought them in all colors for him and even bought a pair work a friend who works with him ( he loves them as well and bought in more colors also ) . neither of them have lost a pair in all of these months . they also have started so many conversations . everyone who has asked about them has done the same and have bought in all colors . it takes a little adjusting and getting use to but everyone we know has never returned a pair . only reason they have returned was to order in more colors or to order for friends and loved ones ! these glasses are fantastic ! thanks for the great service
1	i use and like most all of the olay lines of products . this one is great because it is not only a sunscreen but a skin treatment as well . i ca n't wait for the one that has a `` hint of tan '' in it along with the sunscreen to be on the market . i heard about it , but apparently it is not out as of yet .
1	i love the idea of the glasses always being where i can find them . the only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide the band is . every time i look up the magnets pop apart . if they fix that , i 'd give them 5 stars ! !
0	the sharper image offers a better product which i have been using for about a year but i wanted to try the conair for a little more `` heat . '' i shaved with the hgm 1 and felt pretty good about it . i returned about an hour later and it had emptied an entire can of edge gel ( unplugged ) over the bathroom counter top . go with the sharper image product with this little hint : ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm-up and let it warm up for about 4-5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather
1	these are very tasty . they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you . they also are great in a diaper bag , purse , center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination
1	very classy scent . very strong . spray sparingly , a little goes a long way . lasts all day . will receive many compliments
0	i first bought the standard , and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well . i used them riding a bike in the winter months . neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit . for the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering ( and prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above the ear . the rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists .
1	there 's nothing like grabbing a warm totally sanitized toothbrush . i have used this for years after i saw the inventor on 20/20 i had to try it out . it works great ! its like using a new toothbrush everyday . well worth it
1	i got this for my husband for christmas . i had seen it in magazines but it was expensive for this product , i thought . i was so excited to find it on amazon and he just loves it . he shaves in the shower and the mirror never fogs . it 's a great product
1	bought the massager - overall ok but it is heavy to use with one hand , after sometime it gets to you . it has a good vibration capability better than the others i had . could have a better handle and a longer cord . how about making them 110 - 240v then i can travel with it
1	i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair . it works great ! i got ta admit , it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the `` extra large '' size towel ( which is n't really all that large .
1	i just started taking this pill because i do n't have time to eat at the job i was previously at . it helped a lot ! ! i did lose 8 pound in 1 week . but when i started an office job , i had more than enough time to eat , but i still kept up with taking the pill . it helps with my hunger , it really does . i used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than i can eat ! now since taking this pill i am sensible with my portions and do not rush to eat as if i 'm starving like before . i agree with one of the reviews , if you still eat when you 're not hungry , this pill will not help you . you have to have the in mind that you want to help yourself eat better , slower and sensible portions .
1	i agree with the previous reviewer . i have used this brush for years ! it was recommended to me by a hairdresser , and i will never use a different brush . unless you have fine , thin , hair , you will love this brush ! ! !
0	i purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer . first of all , if this is an ionic dryer i was better off with my super cheap dryer . second , the back seam of the dryer melted ! ! several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying . it shuts off and refuses to come back on . which is good because then it might melt completely . do n't waste your money on this
1	i bought this vaporizer several weeks ago . i feel better after i use this . it created steam very fast ( about 2-3 minutes after plugging ) . you may have to fill some salt to make it create a lot of steam . however , a lot of steam means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this vick for a long time ( about 12-20 hours ) , you may not need to use salt
1	we use the zbars for breakfast , and my kids love them ! i love them too , as they 're organic , contain no trans fat , no refinded sugar or flour . they 're yummy and healthy
1	when i do n't eat as many veggies as i should these are easy to take
0	i was overwhelmed by the choices , and selected this model , in part , because of the reasonal price . i had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product , but i decided there was only a small possibility of that happening . the instructions said to use the lowest setting initially , which certainly made sense . however , the instructions said to move the adjustment `` toward the tip '' , which turned out to be the highest , not the lowest setting ! the diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the larger opening , but i read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later . the spray was very powerful and actually `` hurt '' , especially when it was by my tooth with a crown . the next day i tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink , not in my mouth ! it felt wonderful on the lower setting ! i reread the directions again ( and again over the next several days ) to see if the error was mine or theirs . i still think the directions were not written properly . the third day i had trouble getting any spray at all . this continued for about a week , some days getting more or less , but never a full spray on any setting ! my guess is that it was in a permanent `` pause '' mode . i gave up and pursued returning the item . it needed to be returned to an `` authorized repair '' , which luckily was only a few miles away ( there were only three in my state ) . the repair man had told me , over the phone , it was a discontinued model and had n't been made in about a year . when he looked at it , he found it had been made in 2006 . he said he could fix it , but was n't allowed to ; i am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail .
0	the pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use . i do n't like them
1	i have read reveiws before i bought it that said the trimmer `` pinches '' or cut people , but i have n't found that to be the case . i would n't use it in ultra sensitive places ( but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially dangerous near sensitive areas ) but it does the trick quite well . i have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a good price . it also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver ( which was n't advertised when i bought it ) but worked well on my legs ; not as great as some more expensive electric leg shavers but is great when you do n't have much time . all in all i suggest buying it .
0	i had an old sonicare ( rechargable ) for about a year and a half . i dropped it and it stopped working . ( my fault . ) not willing to pay ~ $ [ ... ] for another rechargable one , i thought i would give the e3000 a try . i then bought my first e3000 in august for 2006 . it mysteriously stopped working around december of 2006 . ( i did n't drop it this time . ) i bought a second one . it also mysteriously stopped working in march of 2007 . ( again , i did n't drop it or harm the toothbrush in any way ! ) 2 dead toothbrushes in 8 months ! i 'm not sure if i should buy another e3000 or if i should give up on the sonicare brand completely .
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them . i am very disappointed . the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky . it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste . it 's very hard to clean . it 's loud , and small brush . not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive . no thank you
1	shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like the norelco and those who prefer foil shavers . for those of you who like foil shavers , this is the one for you ! i 've owned the latest braun 8985 and it was excellent , while it lasted ... the charger kept breaking on me ( once in the first month [ 11/2006 ] , then another time 4 months later [ 3/2007 ] ) . it was expensive , and the refills were a pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided to try the norelco 8140xl ( speed xl ) rotaries , and while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . the problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got the panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors . they shave much faster than the braun and norelcos . i 'm not sure if i like the `` side to side '' pivoting head , only time will tell . the heads do n't pivot up and down as much as the braun , but once again , time will tell if this is necessary . one major advantage is that it cleans with soap and water ... no expensive refills to hassle over . the panasonic has two noticeable downsides : 1 . it 's louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2 . you ca n't plug it in and shave ... you have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on . this is my favorite razor by far .
0	we already owned a different homedics sound machine and it 's far better than this one . the volume control does n't work well at all on this machine ; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static , no matter where we used the machine . the product seemed very flimsy as well . we ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine
0	if i had saved the box i would have returned this product . the head has no pressure what so ever and the head does not screw onto the pipe spout straight so it is always crooked . and it wasnt just one shower i tried it one both of my showers and it was crooked on both pipes
0	save your money - you will go over an area several times . i went back to my basic razor
0	if i could give it less than zero stars , i would . i do n't know how anyone can say this works great . maybe they can tell me what i 'm doing wrong because i ca n't get this thing to work at all . i bought it for my daughter 's birthday thinking she could have some fun with temporary hair color . she has brown hair and nothing showed up at all . i tried everything -- dry hair , wet hair , dirty hair , clean hair -- you name it , i tried it , and we could n't even get a remote hint of color . the picture on the package makes it look as easy and successful as painting your hair -- total false advertising . i kept meaning to return it but never did -- now , it will end up at a garage sale for 5 cents and a note saying `` purchase at your own risk
1	i got the waterpik jp-130 to replace a shower head that was set too low for my husband . installation was easy enough , though , we had to purchase plumber 's white tape to get a good seal . other showerheads i 've purchased have come with the tape included which is why i took off one star . the arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall . it creates a soft fall of water that i really enjoy and the head is large enough that i am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim . i 've not had any problems with the thumb screws and i have been move the unit quite often so that i can shave my legs . i 've loved this product so far and would definitely purchase again .
1	the cherry covered choccolate luna bars are quite tasty . chances are , if you 're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar , you need a little enticement to eat healthy . like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day . i recommend alternating between these and another bar that 's not so sweet ( kashi trail mix bars are perfect ) . that helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop
1	i have , on the advice of my ob/gyn been using dove ( white ) for over 25 years ! ! my skin is very sensitive and dry and he recommended i should use it instead of other brands . he was not wrong ! it works very well for me
1	bought 2 of these 3 years ago on qvc for my husband and myself . i was pregnant with my second son and going to get waxed at the nail shop , where it smelled like nail polish remover , was just too much for me at the time . we love these shavers and they work just as well today as they did 3 years ago ! i 'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about , i get an incredibly close shave with this . to be honest , and maybe a little too personal , i have n't waxed my upper lip since , i only use this ! there is no stubble , no pain and great results ! i have dark hair , and if this in anyway made me look like i shaved , i would never use it ! i am buying 2 more for back up . i hope they never stop making these ! !
1	i am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university . as such , i am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general . i really like neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality . for most people , i think it offers great protection , but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer . according to my dermatologist , recent studies have shown that spf 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and does n't offer adequate protection after that time . this is partly due to most people not using enough . in other words , they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection . for this reason , neutrogena spf 45 or 55 is better . also , the neutrogena ultra sheer products have been updated to include a technology called helioplex . most dermatologists that i know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important . i have used both this product and the higher spf helioplex formulations . in practice , i have found both adequate for my needs . what i particularly like is that you do n't even know you have the product on . it has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you ca n't even notice it . both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use , but my understanding is that the helioplex formulation is even better . further , it feels exactly the same on the skin . the only drawback is it 's a bit more expensive . this is also a good product because it protects against both uva and uvb rays . both are implicated in skin cancer and it 's important to protect yourself against both . if you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one . however , if you want the very best protection try the neutrogena helioplex spf 55 . this will give you the most peace of mind
1	i bought calvin klein for women parfum as a christmas gift to my sister . to see the smile on her face at christmas when she opened her gift , was priceless . as for the cost , it was much less than the department stores at the local mall 's . thank you amazon for a great deal !
1	i read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the sedu . it took me a week to get the product and i anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived . i must say that the products is a dream come true . i am an african american woman and i have never been able to get my hair as straight as i am able to do now , not even when going to the salon . when i went back to work from the weekend , my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked ( because it was truly straight ) . i would recommend this to any woman . i have not been back to the salon in the last 2 months
1	my fiance ( now wife ) and i have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under . she has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation , even with the shick intutition . her pubic region was basically living on neosporen , bikini zone , and gold bond ( not together and not in any particular order ) . we also tried scissors , but that was hard to negotiate , if you will , in the more intimate of areas . at this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal , but was n't ready to pony up the $ $ and commit to an irrevocable decision . although , based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends , i highly doubt that an `` au natural massive overgrowth '' will be in style . the trimmer is great . yes , amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch . yes , it wo n't get you totally smooth or bald . but it is a well built trimmer , which is painless and easy to use . you can adjust the length you want , and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations . just take it easy around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror . if you want the smooth look , use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion . it makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation . i suppose , although we have no interest in it , that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs . hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner
0	i bought myself this book light after giving someone a $ 5 `` robotic '' book light from walgreens . when she used hers it lit up the room . when i got mine today i tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand . had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on . it is flimsy , the light is dim and it 's not worth the wait . go to walgreens instead . mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can
0	the bath seat was easy to put together and satisfactory to use . but some of the metal hardware that was provided for use in assembling the seat was not rust-proof , and rusted after several weeks of use . it makes no sense to make a product used under water that contains metal parts that are not rust-proof .
0	i love this turban . it enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head . it 's lightweight and extremely absorbant . i have been using one for more than 5 years . i 'll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair
1	these are by far the best newborn size diapers especially for small babies , but if you order them through amazon , your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive ! i waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1 , which actually arrived in a few days ! update : i have ordered pampers again through amazon ( different size ) and they shipped right away
0	while the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine , the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside . i have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better . i called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but do n't have any solutions . i asked if they had a website i could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2-3 months . right .
1	the neutrogena norwegian formula foot creme was a dream for this mother . my 7-year-old was unfortunate enough to inherit a severe callous problem that affects his hands and feet . the problem is so severe in his father that his father 's hands and feet are literally split open and very painful . the 7-year-old has already started with very hard calluses and nothing seems to relieve them . nothing , that is , until now . just a small nightly dose seems to be helping immensely into giving my dear son back the soft feet i would expect a 7-year-old to have . i highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry , cracked feet
0	i did not like this thing at all . it took too long to `` shave '' my legs . it did n't even remove all of the hair . it irritated my skin as well .
1	i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past christmas . i am a physical therapist , and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction . i have tried out many cushions over the years , and from my experience , this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent . the composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained , so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use , and the burgundy cover is removable and washable . it is also an excellent size for the average-sized person ( my dad is approximately 5'9 '' , ~170 lbs. ) . it provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products . most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives , like a massager , ribbing on the contours of the cushion , etc . i 've found that simply maintaining good posture ( not only in sitting , but all activity ) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution that commercial products are not a cure-all to one 's problems . it 's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms , but other steps are necessary in terms of fixing the problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist , as it is more than likely necessary that one would need ( at least ) proper education and intevention to help one to get better .
0	this hair dryer did dry my hair quickly . but , it quit working after a month . i exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later . the buttons were also hard to switch . this was a waste of money . i ended up buying a completely different hair dryer
0	this is an expensive fanny pack , not impressed . to enough room for diapers etc
1	i bought this as a trial product , because the other stuff that i bought did n't work as what they advertise it . but this dusters picks up the dust instead of pushing to another place . this refills is quite cheap and it make my cleaning job much easier
0	i would give this product negative 50 stars if i could . i paid beaucoup for several very plain bras ( no lace or other embelishments ) and did n't wear or wash the bras until i received the brababy . i assumed the brababy would protect my bras in the wash , as that 's what the product claims to do . imagine my suprise when i pulled my bras out of the washer ( and out of their respective `` bra demolition cages '' ) to find them ruined . i 'm talking not wearable . the straps of both brand new , never worn , previously mint condition bras were hanging out all over the place and looked like they had been chewed by an animal . both bras had dents in the molded cups . then i saw that one of the bras had two noticeable rips on the cup ! i nearly flipped out ! i think my bras would 've been better `` washed '' had i thrown them into the center of a pack of rabid fighting mad dogs . the only positive thing to report is that amazon refunded my money . back to hand washing my bras and back to the mall i go to replace the ripped bra . perhaps the other with it 's dented cups will be suitable for halloween ?
0	i bought this item and returned it after it stopped working after two days . the massages were not that strong and i feel it was not a good buy even though the price at amazon was way lower than most places . i have since bought another product and it is much nicer
1	i 'm usually a very skeptical person and i do n't trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time . but these vitamins actually do work . it takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work . so if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results . the only thing i hate about the product is the price . but if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you 're in luck . i 'm young and i do n't have alot of money so i ca n't buy these vitamins all the time . but if you have a steady cash flow then you 're in luck and they will totally help you
0	expensive ... and after three months of daily use i ca n't say it has helped my blood pressure . i record my blood pressure every morning at the same time ... after getting up from nights sleep . i use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises . then breakfast and 15 minutes on resperate devise . my blood pressure has n't changed significently in the last six months and i continue to take blood pressure medicine . the resperate device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule has n't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent . i continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but would n't consider buying it again
0	unfortunately , the stool arrived in its box without the seat . as we needed one quickly , we purchased a similar stool locally . we returned the stool and amazon was quick to give us a refund . the manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control
0	i read the directions and followed them to a t. the pain was just too intense ( on my gums - they started to bleed ! ) . i tried to adjust the `` trays '' every which way , but there was no way not to get the gel on my gums . after all the time , trouble and pain , i did n't see any improvement in whiteness . i have used the older crest whitestrips , and liked them much better .
1	as soon as i got this item , i tried it out right away . i will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that 's a minor point . the real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do -- take down mosquitos and flys . sure enough , i killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes . i also took down a housefly without any sweat . this is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where i 'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects . no more an issue
0	sweeeeeet ! duuuuude ! or so i thought . ordered this item in august and still waiting for it . my beloved amazon.com gets no props on this one .
1	saw this product , or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns , australia . it was selling for about $ 70 australia dollars ... ..which is still quite expensive converted to us $ . i came back to u.s. and found it on amazon for $ 15.99 , with free ship if i purchased $ 30 . so , i bought two ... ... one for myself , one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance , so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks , less the neckchains , which always used to get tangled . it 's an ingenius invention
1	i do a lot of walking , as well as standing on my feet all day for work . receiving this product as a test drive was fabulous ! i never knew a cream could work so well at relieving my tired , aching feet and restoring my skin . i 'd definitely recommend this product
1	clif bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars i have ever tried . they may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands , but there have been times where i could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture
1	have had several norelco razors over the years . this is the closest shave i have ever gotten from any electric razor - and it is also the quietest . only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave . highly recommend
0	everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles . my original pair gave out after three years of use . i ordered these because they said `` standard size '' they normally come in small medium and large . well , i am medium and the standard size is large ( same as my husbands ) . i had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so i could wear them . did not have time to return ... .very disappointed . will consider this before ordering from you again .
1	i have loved dolce gabanna light blue since it came out . i was so excited to find it at such a competitive price at amazon , and am certainly a satisfied customer ! the shipping was so fast , i was expecting to wait at least 2 weeks , and it was delivered ahead of schedle ! thanks so much
0	this oregon scientific pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price . there is no point to even considering `` saving money '' when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary
0	i searched around for a quite long time before i decide to purchase this model - the performance of this clipper is very poor , i have to switched back to my old kit to cut my son 's hair . very dispointed
1	i purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully . i also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office , gym and around the world . they are easy to pack and are lightweight
0	i bought this straightener because i wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp . however , while it is not a horrible product , i have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better . i would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store . this is n't any better than those
1	i bought this for my wife when her sonicare died . she loves it . great price . she did n't want the better one and is very happy with it . her teeth look great and she likes the way they feel after brushing
0	this thing is a cheap piece of plastic , and for the same price you can get the larger , nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well . i can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor . it has a nice design in terms of look and it 's compact . i also enjoy the lights for ambiance . but for relaxation , this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it 's worth
0	i order it on july 14th , but i still have to wait for more than a month to get it .
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money . our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair . and that brings around another problem -- emjoi customer service and repair service . you 'll want to avoid both . better yet , avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache . not only are emjoi products cheap , they are painful to use
0	i am a big fan of the regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs and think they are great . however , the sport goggles do not get my vote of confidence . they have three problems which make them unusable for me : 1 ) on all clic products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head . however , unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by clic , the sport googles do not adjust properly and so the goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there is also extra foam padding on the sport googles that make them very snug , but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3 ) the maker does n't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the irridium ( red ) colored lens on some of the sports goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path . sorry clic , but your success with the reading glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the sports goggles . i would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me !
1	my husband is a wheelchair user and loved these , said it keeps his eyes warm while driving down the stree
1	i bought this razor over a year ago , and i would n't trade it in for any other razor out there . it really does leave your skin super smooth . i love the triple blades on it so i know i can get a close , comfortable shave , even in hard to reach places . thanks to the pivoting head , it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut . it 's also excellent for shaving the underarm area . i find that one stroke is all it takes , and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe . this is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day , or more than three times a week . with this razor , it shaves so close to the hair follicle , you will be shaving in less time , less often . i will never part with my venus razor . the best part is - it 's a bargain for what you get !
1	i 've owned this item for about a year and it works great . comfortble to sleep several days in a row on and never had a problem with it deflating . i recommend this item
1	my physician introduced me to this item . he said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods . is affordable and easy to use . oh , did i forget to mention , accurate compaired to a scale model i own . amazon is great to order from , the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days !
0	i did not get the instructional dvd , so i was left with a clipper set i did n't know how to use..
1	for any one who loses their reading glasses or does n't know where to put them these glasses work great . the magnet is strong and the glasses comfortable . this is especially true on the beach . they are what they claimed to be
1	now my husband ca n't `` borrow '' my gasses and i never loose them . i have one of each color and get rave comments every time i take them off in front of strangers .
0	well i have used philips ladyshave before , and i regret for making my mind to try this one ... it hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars
1	you could n't have picked a better person to test drive this product . i have severely dried and callused heals . from the moment i put the creme on my feet , they felt smoother . the creme stays on for hours like the product says . i ca n't believe the difference it 's made in such a short time . i 'll definitely buy this product , and i 'll be recommending it to my mom , whose feet are drier than mine are
0	the previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct . the description of this product is a misnomer . the heating pad never heats up , and takes forever to just warm up . on a scale of 1 to 5 , i would rate it a zero ! do n't waste your money on this . i will be returning mine
0	light didnt turn off , mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall , and mirror became foggy !
0	i made my order 5/26/06 and received my order 7/22/0
0	good scale - could have been better designe for feet - fat measurement pretty close
1	very nice scale , worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh
1	i have a severe dry eye problem and i found in internet that a humidifier may help . i bought big one for home and personal for work . it 's been 2 days and it 's working fine
1	i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend . high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track . i was figuring on getting an arm unit , but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work . the whole system is very easy to use and fast . you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading , but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you . i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy . i can say this was a great gift , something i use a lot , and something that will help me stay healthy
0	i saw that there were mixed reviews for this product before i bought it , but i decided to take a chance on it anyway . unfortunately , both balls broke their first time through the wash. my bras fell out and got squished and creased . do n't buy this ! !
1	my mom came home from rehab and needed an easy way to reach her remote , pills , magazines , eat breakfast ... and still get the table out of the way so she could reach her walker . this type of tray was very useful in rehab . however she did n't want something the looked like the hospital . the white top with a space for a drink and pens and pencils that do n't roll away when you move the tray was perfect . she liked the white top ( vs. the wood grain in rehab ) since she could tell when it was really clean . she was also pleased with the foot rest as part of the base . this was perfect . the reason i rated this at 4 stars and not 5 stars was that the bed kit came with one incorrect size nut so i had to go to the hardware store .
0	the reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller . ( original order was shipped to amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers , and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm . the weighted base does keep it from falling over . unfortunately , the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device . if the user turned the adjustment knob too far , it and the nut that holds it together would fall off . the nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device . the knob actually turns the nut onto the screw . presumably the device is for someone with low vision . if the small nut falls to the floor , i 'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it . my advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens ... . and if possible , try the device out before buying .
1	we have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great ! when it changes color all i do is plug it in for about 10-12 hours and then hang it back up again ! we are very satisfied
1	i am the kind of person that gets leg cramps or easily gets tired legs after a short walk , yet i need to work and that means that i have to be standing long hours . so when i tried your leg massagers i was ecstatic to find out the relief it gave me after a 10 minute use . i now use it every chance i get , my children use it after their soccer games and love it as well . it is one of the best purchases i have made . it was worth the investment
1	if you burn lots of calories in your activities , this high energy food could give you a lift . there are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which is advertised to be at least 70 % organic . this bar is advertised to be for athletes first , and as a casual snack second . if you are overweight and trying to drop pounds , you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed that it looks like compressed goop . however , the compressed goop tastes pretty good . the texture is much like a granola bar , though more moist than a granola bar . the black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated . there are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which is a big plus . i was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial , which is an even bigger plus . one thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy , but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy . i guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process . in either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product . the label also states that there may be traces of peanuts . this bar also contains 20 % of the daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar . there are also lots of vitamins and trace elements , which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing . clif bars could be a casual snack , but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities . if you fall into that category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , and other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package . enjoy !
0	i 'm a fan of the line , i love the chocolate , but this vanilla was too fake tasting and too strong tasting . vanilla should be subtle , this was more like taking a shot of extract .
0	ordered 5 allergen covers from this vendor ; 2 had defective zippers ( would not close after opening ) . image the fun of wrestling with your large mattress and then discover the zipper will not close
0	broke after 5 days . i used it the way it was meant to be used , cleaned it nightly , etc , i had read a review that said theirs broke after a short time and ignored it . i wish i had n't , this is junk
0	i thought these looked so cute when they came out , so i put it on my wishlist last year . from day one , it has never worked right . sometimes it just shuts off on it 's own . of course when you turn it back on you have to start at 88.9 again . there is no visible tuner , just a tiny hard button that hurts your finger when you press it . the antenna began getting rusty after a few months , finally this morning it broke off in my hand . i was able to stick it back in , but then was n't able to tune a station . i turned it upside down and finally got something . if you want hassle free , ease of use , and good quality , this is not for you .
0	i was very excited that one of my `` boys '' had bought me this chair , but when it finally arrived , i was very disppointed . the motors are semi weak , it does not feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that . the chair 's pic is also very unrealistic in my opinion , the seating it not attached , its a pad , very cheaply made not worth the price at all ... i wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair !
0	shaver is bulky , sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver , cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris . i would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back
0	this was a piece of junk . neither my husband nor i could ever get it set correctly -- we wound up throwing it away , going to target and buying one of their 10,000-steps pedometer . that works great
1	item received in perfect condition . checked with doctor . very good blood pressure monitor . thank you
0	i purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep . well folks this is not what happened at all . i turned on my conair su1w and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day . about 5 minutes into my relaxation i almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck . the volume which seemed to have been controlled by satan reached top volume , although i never had touched it myself . i tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring . i unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times , and still it would not work
0	while the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good , this pillow is too small to do an adult much good . it is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose . it could be perfect perhaps for a child
0	when i got this pedometer , i found that the instructions were n't clear . i never did get the thing to work . i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate . this one was n't . the pedometer does n't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost . it 's just easier to buy a new one . however , i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store
1	the clippers are excellent quality and cut well . we have a poodle that has very thick hair . if you take your time , these clippers do a wonderful job
1	i bought this to go with my ms2-200bpt shaver . i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well . i 've been using it for about 1 month and i could n't agree more . a quick spray on the cutters after shaving , and the next time i use it , it runs like new . i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i 've started using it . as a bonus , it seems to last quite a while . another strong product from remington
1	having previously owned battery powered travel razors , i was always disappointed with their power and battery life . after all , what 's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced ? the braun 370-bk was a pleasant surprise , however ; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing . i also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost . a great piece of tech at a good price
0	it looks alot better than it works . very bad vibrations
1	this is the razor to use ! excellent product , does what is says
0	although i am definitely on the 'sonicare ' bandwagon in so far as this product 's ability to clean my teeth -- it does a great job -- this model brush is made quite poorly . the battery compartment ( the e3000 uses 'aa ' batteries ) on mine , regardless of it having an o-ring on the door , seems to be continually wet inside , with the negative ( - ) terminal on one of the aa-cells rusting after only two weeks use . philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution . also , there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side , and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook ' on a daily basis . philips advises that this is probably 'mold ' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried ' after every use . it takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth -- again , while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time , and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $ 64e ( and up ) , there is no reason why the e3000 should n't be made as well as the better units , or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $ 9 crest electrics we commonly see
1	i received this chair very quickly , even though it was close to christmas . the chair was wonderful ! such a great price for such a great chair
0	this is the classic original round stick old spice deodorant formula and now i realize that it is really dated . the formula has n't changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms . if you want the great smell of old spice then just use the after shave and cologne , but stay away from the old stick deodorant . i 'll continue to use the old spice high endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas scents and work much much better .
0	its super cheap , does not work at all , will struggle with the thinnest of hairs . stay away ! !
0	this is not one of the best hair dryers i 've had . at best , it 's average . the nozzle is too long , and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal . i like attachments that can rotate so that i can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair . the ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair . after using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths ( about 3x a week ) , the switch for heat settings is now loose . the dryer only blows cool air even though i slide the switch for higher temperatures . my rating has gone from average to below average
0	this product has not been certified that the harmful mercury has been distilled out . by chance i read an article today in the jan. 16 issue of time by andrew weil , m.d . he advises strongly that fish oil be mercury free . weil also lists the mercury free fish species to buy . he recommends anarctic krill oil . amazon has it but it is expensive . i guess i 'll throw out the almost full bottle of nature made . read up on it . mercury is bad stuff
0	i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son 's fast growing hair . he 's got thick hair that we like to keep `` buzzed '' short . the first time i used the clippers , he complained that they really pull at the hair . i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed . the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair . i 've decided to send it back . reasonably priced but not worth the pain . not recomended for thick hair
0	i had a waterpik which started having problems after a year ( planned obsolescence , la water ... who knows ) . i bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing . i like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small . just my opinion ( humble as it may be
0	i 've used this trimmer only twice , but my initial opinion will lead me to return it . when trimming my moustache , it 's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose . i used it to cut my sons hair , but it kept binding up and pulling his hair . i ultimately gave up and returned to the old oster clippers i have . they buzzed right through with no problem . i 'll be sending this item back
0	it warms ok , not great . but the worst thing is , the massage is loud ! i work at home , in my basement , where it gets cold , and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm , and was excited to get massage too . however , i ca n't use the massage feature while i am on the phone - it is way too loud . and there is no control on the heating element , just on and off . a disappointment . i still use the heat feature , but also wear thick socks
1	i like the portability and adjustability of this mirror . it takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly . it serves my needs very well . i was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit . i tend to use the normal mirror more often . the other is the clock loses it 's setting when i stow it away . it has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature . as far as i am concerned ... i was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock
0	i wanted to buy this for my daughter . i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby . the outside is precious , but once you open it , the pages are like a black and white newspaper material , and they have no structure what so ever . the pages are boring and do n't look very durable
0	i wanted to buy this for my daughter . i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby . the outside is precious , but once you open it , the pages are like a black and white newspaper material , and they have no structure what so ever . the pages are boring and do n't look very durable
1	it 's useful . not the prettiest , but it makes reading more comfortable , especially for those times when you do n't feel like sitting all proper at the table or desk
1	panasonic makes a great electric shaver , this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years
1	great compact design . takes up very little room in your suitcase . rollers heat up are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims . sets hair better then most rollers ( and i have tried many ) . the only thing that i would change , is to add 2-4 more rollers . but i liked these rollers so much , i actually bought a 2nd set use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers i own !
0	you truly get what you pay for . what more can i say
0	i have had this straightener for about a year . it will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and i have to use the high heat settings . also , my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener
0	very simple review - the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month , then it did n't . save your box if you buy this , you may need to return it
1	i 'm not a sucker for advertising and i 'm definitely not an impulse buyer . but i did purchase a schick quattro razor some time ago to replace my old , tired blade . and i 've been satisfied thoroughly with it . however , after needing some refills , i bought these titanium coated blades . wow . i did n't believe it at first but i actually took a new titanium blade and the regular schick blades and ( i ca n't believe i 'm about to confess this ... ) did one of those hokey `` side-by-side '' tests . this blade is excellent . it is an upgrade above their standard blade and , to me , worth the difference in price
0	the guy below is right . the blades are so far down it wo n't cut anything but really long hairs . how could this make it through any product test ? i tossed mine in the garbage .
0	i bought this product based on the great reviews on amazon . i had one of the original epiladies from the eighties , and was expecting some kind of miraculous new design that would be pain-free and effective . well , i guess you ca n't have both . it 's very comfortable to use but completely ineffective . it takes forever to clear each section of hair , and the hair that is taken off breaks off just above the surface . so the result is skin as stubbly as a three day old shaving job . i guess it 's back to the good old razor for me
0	the self cleaning concept was the reason i bought this razor . the razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad . after owning the razor for two months i noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after i had just refilled the fluid . after a closer inspection i found out that the fluid had leaked out all over , and this fluid destroys everything it touches that is n't metal or plastic . i thought maybe i had done something to cause the problem so i refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process . immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together . it is now headed to the landfill . the trimmer does not work well either
0	i bought this from qvc after i had to send back a braun silk epil . the epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness . waxing just hurts too much and is really messy . this sounded ideal i just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks , and upper lip . it trims down your facial hair however , the next day you will notice stubble . you have to really look close to see it , but you can really feel it . you might as well shave . i have not used the brow attachment , i saw the demo on qvc but am afraid i will shave my brows off . would love to know what others think of this item
1	like the razor - i have problems with ingrown hairs on my neck and this shaver has helped to alleviate the problem - the nivea lotion is very soothing . i have had to live with the fact that the shave on my neck is not the closest in the world but c'eat la vie . i have taken to running a couple of passses dry to get a fairly close shave and then starting to apply the lotion as i continue . if you start with the lotion you wo n't get a close shave . i do wonder if one could n't simply buy a shaver ad apply some lotion at the end for the same affect
1	the only sunglass reading glasses i could find , plus because they can hang around the neck i do n't forget where they are
1	this is a great heating pad if you like heat . it ranges from low to hi with 4 settings in between . ( that is 6 settings ) especially nice is the loooooong cord . my old heating pad has like a 6 ft. cord and i always needed an extension cord for it . good purchase !
0	i purchased two aquis microfiber , waffle , white ( 19 x 39 inches ) towels . although they are quite expensive , the positive reviews made them sound great . well , they are not . the towels are quite thin , and do not rub/slide well on the skin . they give the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when you rub your skin . they are the same thickness as a dish towel , so we are using them to blot the dishes when they come out of the dishwasher . save your money on this one !
1	when i found out that contradiction was no longer going to be sold in the us i thought i would never find this again . it 's my boyfriend 's favorite cologne and i was determined to find it . thanks to amazon , he has his sexy scent back . lo
1	this was a perfect fit for my healthy lifestyle ! what i found also very helpful was getyoursexyon.myarbonne.com it was the only thing that i never thought would be missing from trying to be healthy everyday . guess there 's enough people vouching for my all time fav cliff bars so i wanted to spread the word , i know i wish i would have found out sooner !
1	as advertized , as promised - and at a savings ! ( better pricing c/w - walmart , target and online
1	i am a woman of color and this product eliminates any discoloration without irritation or disturbing my combination skin . i highly recommend this product for women who need to brighten their appearance once a week . after 5 years i continue to use this and the pumpkin exfoliating mask . the papaya is good as well
0	i am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging `` palm kernel oil '' as an ingredient . do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil , cocoa butter , and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many `` organic '' things are added to it . for many years now , it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease . the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases .
0	these are just ok , not great . i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them . the sunglasses , however , are not as sturdy , the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just can not endorse them . i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses . it 's a shame
0	the only reason that i am writing this review is because i am on line now looking for a new trimmer . i bought this `` gem '' less than a year ago and was not satisfied then . tonight , i 'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out . the extra cutting heads are all but worthless . i would never recommend this p.o.s to anybody . i wish i could give it 0 stars
0	after user # 1 i was really impressed . my teeth were noticeably whiter -- almost gleaming . after use number two i noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic . on use # 3 i felt some discomfort after putting the trays in . after about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and i thought something must be wrong so i took them out . my gums were bleached white ! i was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour . however , there was some lingering damage done that , while not severe , is annoying ( there is still a slight bit of bleeding ) . i have perfectly healthy gums so i was surprised by this ... the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums . my advice , if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out
0	i would give it negative stars but that was n't an option . this thing is horrible ... does n't cut very close , certainly does n't hold a charge , engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes . and oh yeah ... the horrible razor burn ! ! ! seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams
1	doug ritter and his foundation , equipped to survive , has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit . it is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket , yet fully functional . although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit ( something of a rite of passage among the survivalists/emergency preparedness folk ) , i spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit . the military issue sparklite and tinder-quick , fox-40 whistle , and rescue flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear . this pack is extremely high quality through and through , from choice of equipment to packing and instructions . i recommend looking at the ets website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what doug ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit ( the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs ) . the pocket survival pack is an amazing value . i 've purchased all of the items separately , and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost ! if you are lucky enough to get everything at one store , you 'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this . i know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits ! that 's how economical it is . plus , if you buy this psp , a portion of the proceeds goes to the ets non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards . in fact , doug ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine , aviation , and remote travel . the kit itself comes in a waterproof container . i found it to be a bit tight when closing back up , but there is actually some room for more items . all components are of the highest quality . it 's lightweight and i never notice it in a pocket . with the recommended ets or similar keychain led flashlight and a good pocket folding knife , you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $ 100+ . these are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping/hiking/marine/aviation gear you might have . i highly recommend this psp . i 'm not affiliated with ets , but i 've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums . and if this was a bad kit , i 'd still say so . i give it 5 stars , great value for the price and it really could save your life
0	the mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell . after receiving it , i left it in an open room for 2 weeks before i can sleep on it . the `` free '' pillow smells even worse . it can be not exchanged since it is `` free '' . i guess i am supposed to toss it since it 's `` free '' . i think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable , after all .
0	nice idea for all of us office workers , but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support . furthermore , the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support . i am looking for something else
0	worked alright for a few months . i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e . skin irritation , hair pulls . i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads . it did n't . the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage , no doubt due to the cheap plastic used . never again

0	i purchased this product for my husband for christmas . he has been in two car accidents and has migraines . we thought this might help . it does n't . he feels very uncomfortable in fact . my mom has arthritis of the spine and she could not use it either . in fact , if you are short , as my mother and myself are , it does n't do anything for you
1	i got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and i thought they 'd improve upon the mach3 . well they did ! this turbo brand of mach 3 is actually much better ; his shave lasts longer , the blades last longer , and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave . i choose this one over that mach3 power vibrating blade because , i do n't know , a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion . haha ... he 's very happy with it and likes the shave . and speaking about money , if the shave and blades last longer than before , it 's a great value ! highly suggested ! !
1	safari by ralph lauren for women is the only eau de parfum my niece uses . after she discovered safari she gave away her collection of purfumes . i usually try to find safari for her birthday every year .
1	i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer , i found it easy to use and accurate ; however , after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor , and that was it , it no longer works ... i will probably buy another one , but it needs to be treated with kid-gloves .
0	i could n't even assemble the product , and there were no instructions on how to do so
0	what a gimmick . its nothing but pure alcohol . i should have looked at the ingreidents list . i should have bought princereigns or min , but i bought into all those phony reviews below
1	sedamine is great sleep aid . i 've been dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and i tried nearly everything including old remedies-i thought i would go crazy if i did n't find help . not sleeping has been awful . since end of july i started with the sedamine product and it started working right way . i tell anyone to try it cause it help me it help anyone .
1	im a truck driver that dosent drink coffee . can you believe it ! ? my hours are really weird as my day may start at 8am or at 8pm i might work for 10 to 14 hours per shift . ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a time have always gotten the boost i need to get where im going . i also may use it to start my day or to finish it . i started using 5 hour about 6 months ago . i dont use it everyday but when i need it , it works well . the nice thing is , when i finally call it a day i can lay down get to sleep . unlike other products ive used , i dont have that ragged feeling afterward . i purchase in quantities of 100 carry 25 or so on the road .
1	after a few months of debating whether or not i needed the extra light for my work space i made the great choice of purchasing the happylite . i 've been using it the past few weeks and have really enjoyed how it brightens up the dark corner better than a regular lamp . now my only concern is how to order an extra bulb ... . ( guess i should read the materials it came with ) .
1	i was surprised to open this pedometer page after sometime and see all the negative reviews it receives . i have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now and i am really satisfied with it . it is really accurate ( 1 % declination , i have performed more than four tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life and i have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly to belt or pants , displays the time conveniently and has nice backlight , even has a radio which works , although as most people said , not really its best feature . the truth is that i am not using the radio at all , mostly because i believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to walmart . but i have tested it and it works , although nothing impressive there . of course , for the money , i think you can not go wrong with this pedometer . one funny comment is that , although most people complain it can not open very easily , after sometime it will open more easily that you think . actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake , will open it wide , so it does not count any steps . but it does not open by itself anyway , needs external force for this to happen , so it does not happen often . all in all , i am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews . maybe i have been lucky , maybe not , but this has been one of the best and most reliable devices that i carry and use every day . and a great incentive for walking and exercising more
0	this thing is horrible . cumbersome to use and does nothing . i have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor . it removes a little bit of dirt but does n't actually clean a rug/carpet . i 'm giving it one star because amazon wo n't let me rate it -0
1	if you own one of these shavers , then you need to replace with these every year . buy the best , buy these , and shaver will stay like new
0	has anyone taken this formula during natural childbirth and does it help ? ? ? ? ? ? please respond
0	we got this for our shower . our son is now 2 and the only thing we 've used is the nail clippers . which i actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers , especially if baby starts to squirm a little . i could n't even tell you where the rest of it is . the spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless . any baby medication you buy you 'll get a dropper for which works way better . the bulb did n't work well at all , just keep the one you get in the hospital , those work best ! and if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while i tried to take his temp . i recomend a therma scan for that . just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go . so basicly , i would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers .
0	this item is garbage ; i purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash . sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me , it 's not worth the frustratio
0	unlike several other reviewers , i loved this trimmer for 5 months . at that time the rechargeable battery just died completely , would not recharge at all , and the remington people are useless when filing a complain
1	these were a great deal and they are the only diapers , other than cruisers , that my son does n't leak through .
0	it is a great disappointment with amazon when it pushed to sell a product , wes9006pc replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the panasonic es8162s pro curve elite convex wet/dry shaver i purchased . amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if i made a purchase those products together i would save money . now i was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with wes9006pc replacement .
1	bought this for my husband who has a 2 hour ( one way ) commute by bus to work . he loves it . now he can nap without waking up with a cramp in his neck . it is very portable , with a small carrying case and is easy to blow-up . a bargain for the price
1	i work at a nursing home for the elderly and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to go home , and to know that i have this product at my beck and call . wow ! ! i am a owner of this product for 6 months now and i all i can say is i love it.. so what is requires special water a gallon lasts me for two months so i do n't mind spending $ .75 every two months . i use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser from panasonic and i now i use less make up than ever . i normally wear foundation , pressed powder and loose . now it is just pressed powder . it allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my pores . i do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the treatment along with a favorite cd and i am on a fifteen minute vacation without leaving home . i take the towel off and my pores are ready for the final stage . i turn on the cool mist and apply a moisturizer at the last minute and i am ready to face another day .
0	i personally have not taken this diet pill ; however i am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt `` trippy '' `` weird '' and `` out of sorts '' . britney spears had been taking this stuff for a while ... then as we all know she went all `` postal '' , shaved her head , attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and did n't return ... ..and we wonder why she did it ... hummmm ... none the less , the side effects like those reported i 've seen personally from close friends . they should re-name this diet pill asylum-x , because that 's where you 'll be . diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids , and i do n't know about you but i 'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being ... .just something for you to `` swallow ''
0	this scale was off by about 10 or 15 pounds . i went to the doctor a few days after getting this scale and i was so relieved to find out that i was not 10 pounds heavier than i feared . do n't waste your money on a scale that wo n't give you an accurate weight
1	this product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair . this has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron ! i would give this product 10 stars if it were available ! my hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by chi . i absolutely recommend this to anyone
0	i bought the duro-med 7921lcst-bg because of a back injury -- i need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably . this product is very disappointing . the material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all . if you need firm back support , i would look elsewhere ( i do n't know of a good source yet ) . if you do n't need such support , then i do n't know why you 'd have any interest in this product -- but i suppose there could be valid reasons that i ca n't imagine
1	easy to open package , tastes good , stays fresh after opening and not using all at once , does what it 's advertised to do
0	i 've read a lot of reviews on this product . it obviously works for some people , but be aware it does n't work for everyone . me being one of the latter . i 've taken it twice and both times it did nothing . first time i took it before i left for work . the drive to work i was yawning and about to fall asleep . i did n't get 5 minutes of energy let alone 5 hours . second time i took it was about 15 minutes ago . still nothing . i was feeling sleepy and still am . my mom , on the other hand , says it makes her energetic as hell . it might work for you . it might not , but 5 dollars ( 2 pack was all they had ) is a lot to waste to find out .
1	the best part about my ijoy 130 is the price i paid . day after xmas linens and things had only the floor model left . got 20 % off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10 % off . 30 % off made the chair $ 500 instead of $ 700 . i am in it as i write this ! ! ! very nice and relaxing . sometimes the `` percussion '' setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it 's great . i would agree that i wish it went a little further up the neck . i just sit a little lower in the chair for it . not sure if it 's worth $ 700 just because that 's alot of money but i 've got no problem with $ 500 . i think my wife and i will get alot of use out of it
1	my son loves this . it 's great for a night light . he can even fill it up himself . i recommend it for a childrens room

1	i think it nice for me , make my eyes relax after long-time working before computer
1	i recently started weight watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale . i figured i would buy a ww product , but after reading the reviews , i decided to go with the omron scale . i am very pleased with this product . it has been extremely accurate . it keeps a history for both my husband and i. i would highly recommend this scale to anyone ! it is also an attractive scale which is a bonus . go with the omron scale
1	this book is beautiful outside , i love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front . what i do not like is how there is no specific places to write in , you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page..too much like scrapbooking for me , i wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in..for example one blank page will say , `` all about mom '' then another that says `` baby shower '' etc..but the pages are blank . i need more structure
0	the product does not work as it is shown on tv . there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy . the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust
0	both my wife and i have high blood pressure , which our doctor would like us to track at home . after checking out many brands and styles of automatic monitors , and based on the reviews here , i did n't hesitate to buy the mark of fitness , inc monitor ( prevention edition ) . when i received it , there were two problems : first , there was no owner 's manual inside . since i kept getting an `` err 2 '' message , i had no way of checking what that meant . ( amazon.com suggested i look online for a pdf version somewhere . unfortunately , the mark of fitness ' web site did n't have online manuals . ) the second and more important problem with this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate . when i finally was able to get some readings , they were : 112/64 , 106/60 , 96/61 , 106/62 , 109/64 , and 115/62 . oh , how i wish some of those were my readings ! maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one in 500 lemons with no owner 's manual and who knows what else wrong with it , but unfortunately , i wo n't take a chance on trying another one . it 's going back today
1	these paper towels are as good as any cheaper paper towels ; they are not cloth-like or super thick , but they are as good as any other paper towels you might find for the same price that are n't made of recycled materials . in short , they are cheap and better for the environment than non-recycled , chlorine-bleached products
1	i 've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best . strong motor , easy adjust , strong vacuum . other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me . one would n't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard ... . the idea is to glide the unit over your beard ... you 're not raking , you 're trimming ! also the unit is easy to clean out after use . the waste receptacle snaps out easily , as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris
1	this water jet is excellent . it allows you to have a separate chamber for water and mouthwash . it also comes with different attachments for your gums , teeth and tongue . excellent product at an excellent price
1	this is a really good supplement to help you regulate your sleep pattern . people please grow up and stop using this amazon review site to post useless nonsense ... go blog somewhere else
0	this product would be excellent but runs fully 4 '' too narrow and 3 '' too short . this creates an aprox . 2 '' lip around the entire matress . very odd . this short coming disturbs the experience substantially . the laminated back works well . be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine
0	was excited about this after reading the reviews , but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag . after buying it and trying it , i went out and bought a larger one . barely ever use this
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you
1	we needed something for our baby 's room so that we would n't have to tip-toe around the house while she was napping . we ordered this item based on the great reviews , but did n't really know what to expect . it 's much like the noise produced by a small fan , but without blowing air . it has two speeds , and complete control over the volume and pitch by adjustment of the louvers . some reviews we read said it was not loud enough . i ca n't imagine that being a problem as we have it on the quietest setting ( louvers completely closed , and low speed ) and it 's perfect . on high it 's plenty loud for a device used while sleeping . this product did the trick for us , and i would recommend it to anybody with a light-sleeping baby
1	this product is a blessing for handicapped users . it is solidly built , easy to roll about with and makes being mobile a wonderful reality . plus , i do n't think you can beat the price , which gives you a model that ca n't be beaten . also , delivery was lightening fast
1	this is one of the nicest electric shavers that i 've owned and the first wet-type shaver . i have previously owned norelcos for over a decade . the original norelcos ( made in holland ) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair ! it is painful ! i eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars . bad idea - you do n't always get what you pay for ! i was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable gillettes , decided to try a wet shaver . i took my chance on this one , based solely on the reviews here . this is the very first `` wet '' shaver i 've used and absolutely love it . it gives a close enough shave but not too close . you can use it with whatever shaving cream you use . note that the panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type ( not gel ) , barbasol like stuff with this shaver . it also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get ( just wash the thing under tap water ) . they really meant that this unit is washable . it is recharagable , lasts seven days on a charge , and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands . the build quality is excellent . the charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space . you can not go wrong with this . amazon has a great value here . sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things . highly recommended .
1	what i like best is that it is non addictive . it puts you right to sleep within 20-30 minutes . it really helped me and my boyfriend regulate our sleep patterns
0	this product is a piece of garbage.when it works , it does what it is suppose to do . however , it worked for the first two weeks and then totally died on me.do not buy this product
0	i purchased this towel warmer for my wife . she has been very disappointed . it simply does not get hot enough to heat towels so she has stopped using it . i would not recommend it to anyone .
1	upgraded from an old norelco to this and just love it . shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip . the only con i see is the 8 hour charge time , which has been the norm for norelcos in this class for a long time . if you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price , this is a great choice
0	i wo n't be buying these , because there is not enough public comments or even actual photos of people using these goggles . if you look closely on the example photos provided by amazon the people that supposingly wear these things , then you 'll notice they are n't really wearing them its just drawn
0	i have never used such an impactless ( if that is a word ) product . there is absolutely no effect whatsoever , not even remotely . it is simply a waste of money and bottle . i am terribly disappointed - you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect ... ..
0	the product is great , i already have the uni-lateral one and it rocks , so i wanted to buy the bi- lateral aka 2.. and two times they have sent me uni ones that were labeled as bi.. so your best bet is to bi 2 uni 's by themselves until amazon fixes the problem..
0	a total piece of garbage , do not buy this at all . first of all it is battery operated which i did not know when i bought it . secondly , when i went to put batteries in it , the terminals in side of it are offset , one is higher than the other , and the higher terminal was damaged . when i put the batteries in and put the cover on it did not work , the case was pushing the battery away from the terminal . it worked without the cover on but that doesnt do anyone any good if u cant prevent the batteries from falling out . the thing is rather loud too and cover is a piece of cheap plastic . the thing is a piece of garbae , do not buy this item ! ! ! ! !
1	good product - the pressure could be a little stronger with the sponge head . it has a nice scent , and when the crystals had leaked upon arrival i had excellent customer service from the company to replace it .
1	clothes are soft and smell great works just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you , your family , and the enviroment
1	i love the olay regenerist line ! moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth . you will see a big difference after the first use ! i 've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it 's great .
0	over time ( 9 months ) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing . customer service told me to buy a new one . i guess it really is 'all about the money ' . pass this loser . buy a metal body filter
1	as a tape measure , it does what it says it does . you press a button and the tape tightens around your body part . you wo n't have to worry about , `` did i hold the tape tigher last time ? '' as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time . the tape starts measurement at 2 '' since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches . i think this tape is accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level
1	i have tried nearly all brands of energy bars . hooah ! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ
0	sleepmd did not work for me and in fact kept me awake most of the night . the next day i felt horrible , partly because i got no sleep and partly because i had been ripped off for $ 20 . i threw the pills in the trash and will never purchase any md product again .
1	i bought this for my aged mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel i 'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle . she *adores* the microfiber towels i got her ! they are light for her weak arms , they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that 's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly . not to mention that i , a hearty creature in my prime , love these towels too ! i shall be buying more of various styles and colors
0	i bought this with the notion that i would be receiving what was pictured : the filters that have a built in replacement gauge . oops ! what i ended up with was the cheaper , replace every two month whether they need it or not filters . oh well , whats a little customer service when there 's a buck to be made . not like it 's false advertising to send people a cheaper product then what they thought they were getting
0	i purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it . i already have the penguin which is also by this company ... and that one worked perfectly . i do n't know if it is because of the design ... but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running . you have to constantly shake it to get it going again . obviously a manufacturer error . i must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at . my kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute . but , it just did n't work
0	we received it with broken cover . it did n't work properly and stopped running every hour . we tried different ways to make it run , but nothing worked . we 've returned it . it 's just waste of money . on the other hand the cow-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well . no complaints
0	i had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut-off and it works wonderfully . i just bought another one for our sickly kitten and they have added an automatic shut-off valve that they do not mention in the product description ! i wanted a heating pad without automatic shut-off ! i can get a heating pad with an automatic shut-off anywhere
1	i was looking for a lightweight simple wet/dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies . the panasonic wes9941p fit perfectly . gives a nice shave , and it 's so easy to clean . it replaces my old braun single head linear . ( i like the panasonic better . ) the batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge . give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close
1	if your looking for a bar that hits the spot without leaving you wanting more this is the bar for you provides great flavor and satisfies i highly recommend this bar for in between snacks not to high in fat has more carbs than other protein bars but is a great overall ba
1	just received it and used it and can only say it is the greatest shaver ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the closest shave , no razor burn , fastest shave yet and very quite . thank you norelco for this great saver . j
1	these bags are much sturdier and thicker than the gerber bags . you also do n't have to cut the bags open after defrosting/heating them up . amazingly they are cheaper than the gerber bags too ! i 've used them for several months and have n't had one leak yet . but i am pretty careful and store the milk bags flat in tupperware containers in the freezer
1	this thing is really cool and works very easily . once you perform the 10 minute setup and enter your info ( once ) , you just step on it and tell it what setup number your are and it takes and saves the measurement . it seems very steady and well built and i think it should last a long time
1	if you do n't like getting attention , these are not for you . i 'm often surprised by people 's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off ; i 'm so accustomed to pulling them apart , that i forget how unusual the viewing public finds it . i have been wearing clics for nearly a year . i pretend that i do n't need glasses , but of course i do and have for nearly a decade . popped the standard diopter lenses out , and put in my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite a warning from my optical shop . ( and even if they had broken from the experiment , the price is right : i could try it again . ) previously i was wearing glasses on a chain . besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer , i also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching . then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break . i call the color of mine `` magenta '' - which may or may not be the same as the online `` red '' - i bought them in a shop ( **gasp** ) . my short hair is not a problem , but i agree that reading in bed does n't work . so i use a different pair for those occasions
1	i 've owned several norelco shavers in the past but the 7180xl is definitely the best . this shaver is extremely light weight , quiet and gives an extremely close/smooth shave . i find that i get 5 days of shaves on one full charge and a full charge takes about 50 minutes to complete . the shaver is also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods . the only complaint i have about the shaver is that no traveling case/pouch holder comes with it to hold the cord , shaver and cleaning brush . just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously owned shaver ( s ) . only time will tell on how this model will hold up . my 4 previous norelcos have averaged around 5-6 years each
0	i bought this for my lower back . i am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time . it is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other . however , the inner pad bunches up tremendously . i have used it for a few weeks now , and have to take the cover off to `` open '' the pad back up by stretching it out again . it has n't gone back to the original shape . if i had known it would do this , i would have never purchased it .
1	this is the best investment ever ! they start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin . it was so easy to set up start enjoying . i 've used it on average twice a week and my feet hands are so wonderfully moist -- even in this winter weather . my heels are no longer cracked my cuticles are so healthy -- not snagging at all . thank you for this perfect product so much cheaper than going to the salon ! it 's so relaxing ( i use lavender ) as i do this just before bed
0	these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used to buy them . i first bought these pills last year in june 2005 after hair formula 37 's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage . well , these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned , and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy , and it did absolute nothing . i said to myself , like hair formula 37 , that maybe i just need to give this more time , so i bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all . this product might just work for others , which it has , but it certainly did n't work for me . i must admit that i brought this on myself , as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway , and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store ! thus , i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money . and if you are going to , please do n't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com .
0	i tried this deodorant for 2 weeks and it peeled of my skin . stay away
0	the size is good but the second one we ordered leaked . the cap did not fit ... the after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $ 6- $ 10 dollars in the market around . too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product
0	while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products , this conditioner ( and i might add shampoo by the same name ) was a real disappointment . using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent . do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one . i 'm saving my $ $ $ $ $ for lush and frederic fekkai ! - gail cook
1	i ordered this walker for my father a few months ago and am well-pleased . it is much less expensive than comparable walkers . the cushioned seat and basket are handy for long `` trips '' and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas . a good buy for someone looking for a quality walker . even ships for free
1	love this product , have been using oil of olay before it was heard of by most.this is more advanced and makes my skin look and feel more youthful
0	this is an inexpensive scale for measuring weight and body fat . the only problem is it does n't do either one too well . the weight measurement gives a different answer every time you step on it , even if you weighed yourself just a minute before . i was never able to get the scale to measure my fat percentage or give me any other reading besides an error . maybe my skin 's too thick , or maybe the electrical charge it tries to send through your body is too weak . it 's also inconvenient to use . to get your weight , all you have to do is step on it . to get the weight and fat reading , you have to hit the power button multiple times to cycle through all the settings , then step on the scale within 5-10 seconds to avoid it turning back off
1	the stuff can seem somewhat pricy ( specially on a college budget ) but it 's well worth it . the taste is n't much to talk about ; you 're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once . then again , weightlifters do n't eat supplements for taste do they ? i have a huge energy problem , i lack it a lot . between class and work , i 'm usually drained at the end of the day , but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard . this is n't to say that it wo n't requre motivation on your part , but it sure helps . during the workout , you may notice an increase in your pump . my muscles felt so tight and big , that i just wanted to lift more and more . by the time i was done , i went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror . i 've had great pumps before , but this was insane ! it did n't even look like me at all ; it felt great . i 've been using it for 2 months now and i do n't train a day without it . highly , highly recommended
0	this device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity . one must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal . nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse , as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding . at best , this device might manage to acurately read a pulse after a strenuous activity is concluded
0	when i ordered this item , i assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use . actually , each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it , to be used once and discarded . let me see : a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world 's landfills every year . i already compromise my principles for convenience more than i 'd like to admit . this is totally over the top . when i 've used up my supply of flossers , out this thing goes . it goes into the landfill , to be sure . so do n't anyone else make my mistake
1	i bought two of these for my son ... .hoping to wean him out of pull-ups at night , without having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident . this pad is definitely leakproof . the only con is that even though it says it has an anti-slip backing ... .that is not the case . i have tried it with jersey sheets , and flannel sheets ... but it does move alot and get bunched up . so , i do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night . if i had it to do over again , i would definitely buy the pad with the tuck-under flaps .
0	i was looking forward to get the massager , which i was for a while searching . but i regret to inform you that i could use this item for only 2 times @ 15 minutes . after the it did n't work . ( the light on the adapter do not work ) i 'm glad that i can express this .
1	my arms used to get so sore because i 'd blow-dry my thick , frizzy , curly hair for about 1 1/2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal-mart . after having a stylist at mastercuts use this on my hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour , i knew i had to buy this product . this is a great price considering at most places like trade secret , the iron alone can cost about $ 129 plus tax , plus the chi products are $ 15 and up . it 's a great value , and it benefits a great cause , so why not ? so if you have unruly , thick , curly hair- this is the product for you ! just be careful because it does get really hot- i burned my ear a bit . other than some common sense , anyone can use it and achieve great results . i tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it , and i 've almost got it down
1	i bought from the 3 types of olay total effect , and i did try them after reading the instruction , there is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence , the company was very good in logistic maters
1	the monitor is relatively cheap , easy to use , and mostly accurate . the one gripe i have is that if i take my pulse 3 times in one minute or less the rate can range by up to 40 points ! usually , this is not a problem . i tend to check it 3 times and average the 3 which is sufficient for my purposes .
1	i bought an epilator because i was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me . i 've had my epilator for several weeks now and i am already seeing amazing results ! i used it for the first time on my legs . i 'm not going to lie ... it was painful . i just made sure to go slowly , pausing every few inches , and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as i could get it . eventually , i was able to get most of the thick , dark hairs off of my legs . **please know that the epilator is not an immediate `` cure-all '' . hair grows in stages , so as soon as you get rid of some hairs , several more grow in behind them . ( eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them , but it will take some time . ) because of this , it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week . since it 's winter , i just let it all grow out so that the epilator can get more hairs . however , when new hair grows in , i am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown . it does n't hurt nearly as much to pull those out ! i also know that i 'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter . my legs are smoother and i do n't get razor burn ! right after epilating , sometimes i do experience a little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just a short time . another neat thing is that , unlike waxing , the epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . this gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth ! i used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed . now , i get smoother skin just about whenever i want to ! i was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product i had not heard much about . with the exception of the few reviews i read online , i was pretty much in the dark . i went ahead and went for it , then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks ! not only have i epilated my legs , i have also used it under my arms , on my upper lip , and on my bikini line . the results have been better than i could have imagined ! ! again , i 'm not going to lie ... ouch ! ! ! ! ! epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days ( i have very thick hairs ) . however , i got the majority of the hairs and after the first time , i realized that i 'm never going to have to shave again ! yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they are all thinner and much less painful . in fact , sometimes it tickles a little . : o ) i epilate there once to twice a week ( about a five minute job if you 're being careful , two if you 're in a hurry ) and i have smoother underarms ! i used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month . now i just epilate . it hurts , but just for a second . plus , i keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax , i only need to pull 5-10 each time . **a word of caution : our skin is more sensitive in some areas , so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line , be careful . i managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating `` blade '' . now i just make sure that i do n't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds . if i miss some hairs , i come back another time to get them . this epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs ( i 've only had a few and the pad fixes them ) and a little cleaning brush . the epilator is very easy to clean . the top ( dark purple section ) pops off and you run it under hot water . when it dries , you put it back on . **note , the epilator does not store hairs inside of it . when they are pulled out , they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator ( i stop periodically to wipe them off ) or they go flying . i sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs . i hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator . i am very satisfied with this product and i recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time . **are the few minutes of pain worth it ? ? ? absolutely ! : o )
1	very convenient reading glasses . you could hang them on your neck when not using them , and not even notice they are there . they are very sturdy , and are flexible making them almost imposible to break . cons : both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side . they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face . the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair , as the glasses would trap your hair against your face
1	have n't had to clean it yet and it keeps the humidity level in out daughter 's room between 41 and 53 % . we have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all . works as advertised and worth every penny
1	i loved this product , really leaves my hair really straight without even blow drying ! ! i have curly hair and it worked pretty well , my hair was smooth and shiny , i 'm very happy with my straightener
1	i ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out . loved it , so i ordered a full and kingsize too ! i find i do n't move around as much as i used to . a more restfull sleep
1	the chair has simple pre-set programs ( i basically use only the full-body massage ) , but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area . of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the $ 2,500 chairs , but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value
0	i thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired . my first thought was to contact the parent company , hy-tek manufacturing , to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions . after 3 days they did get back to me , recommending amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information . i sent a second email but it was completely ignored . maybe this should have been a warning . i decided to go ahead and order one anyway . the purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form amazon 's agent was about 5 days , more than acceptable . the unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions . actual programming is simple and very straight forward . the problems started after successfully programming my dad 's satellite receiver . the main menu could not be accessed , the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work . i tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver , none of them made any difference . another email to hy-tek , and another 3 day wait , produced the response `` it does n't work with all devices and i guess it just wo n't work with your receiver , you 'll have to send it back to the supplier . we will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. `` no help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer . if they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place , i would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and would n't have been out the freight charges . one of the questions that i asked originally was `` will it access the main menu ? `` , but they did n't have the common courtesy to respond . be aware that this remote will not work with all devices . even simple , necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible . the manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do . would i recommend or purchase this item again , absolutely not
1	i purchased this for use in my bathtub . it is more comfortable than the blow-up ones and stays cleaner .
1	i started using this several months ago after seeing it chosen as the best by consumer 's report . within a few weeks , i could see measurable improvement in my skin . sure , not all the deep wrinkles went away , but enough of the smaller ones smoothed away so my 58-year-old skin looks younger . my skin feels so much smoother and looks fresh . i 've had a lot of sun exposure from living in australia , south texas and florida , so i 'm thrilled to find a cream that does such a good job . lots cheaper too than many skin creams
0	i ordered 2 of these . only 1 came with the ac plug . that was disappointing
0	i do n't know how this works because when i found that i would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work , i returned it . it is n't evident in the advert for this ( or any other ) heart-rate monitor . i guess i 'll have to trust my sense of pain ...
1	i came across the hooah drink because my boss -- a retired military man running for office -- always has a case lying around . with campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long , these are invaluable for getting me through the day , and keeping my thoughts coherent . apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent . i ca n't measure that in myself of course , but i do sense a dramatic improvement
0	this is the first time in my life i have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product . when i first saw the ad for this on tv , i thought it sounded like just what i needed . i rushed to the store , but it was n't even on sale yet . finally i found it yesterday at walgreen's- and i hate to say- it stinks ! i have just below shoulder length curly hair . i generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- i hate spending a lot of time on my hair . but once in a while i straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush , and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish . i am not very good with a hair dryer , and it takes me a long time and i find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer , and i do n't do a very good job . plus then i need to use the iron too , and it takes me a good 30-45 min total . so i thought this product would be great . all in one ! a time-saver ! easier to use ! well , i was wrong . first of all , it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer . it 's not very powerful . next , it was barely straight ! even on the `` 4 '' setting , there was n't much tension at all . it left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight . so after an hour , i had hair that was not as straight as if i had just dried it alone- and i still needed to use the flatiron . do n't be fooled . it will not give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box . i just hope i can return it . guess i will stick with my chi iron for now . i *might* try the `` long hair '' version of this dryer to see if that 's any better
0	i 'm sorry that i ordered these online . i should have tried them first . they do not fit round heads . no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit . the bow needs to have an adjustment too . the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off . would not buy another pair .
1	product arrived as expected . i 've had the tooth brush for about a year now and i love it . one complain i have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty . it cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach . i have not tried soaking it in oxyclean , that might work even better .
0	the hair dryer is very heavy . also , while i like the yellow design of the dryer itself , the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool
0	so , yeah , it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups , and once it 's mounted , it stays put pretty well . unfortunately , it has so far never actually been `` fogless . '' get a good shower going , and the mirror fogs up in record time . splash some water on it , and you can see yourself for half a minute , but overall , this is a disappointment .
1	i received this parfum as a birthday gift and i fell in love with it as soon as i smelled it . the scent lasts all day without being too overbearing . i swear every single time i wear this , someone stops me and asks what am i wearing . the fragrance is crisp and sensual . it kind of reminds me of bath body works ' moonlight path . buy it , you wo n't regret it , especially for the price that amazon is offering it for
0	i am a 20 year user of several remington products , but i must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver . the remington es-1000 utra smooth bump control shaver was designed to replace the original ( bms ) black man 's shaver which was discountinued several years ago . i recently purchased and used the es-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance . the es-1000 performed so poorly that i had to use my bms that i had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the es-1000 shaver could not and did not remove . the product should be called `` ultra poor with a sandpaper finish . '' the product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet . for anyone with curly hair problems , you may want to consider comparing this product against the wahl 5-star series , model # 8061 . i think you will find there is a major difference in the products
0	the battery life is the worst of any electric razor i 've ever used . the razor does n't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses . the razor is very cheaply constructed and i would not recommend this to anyone . you 're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine
1	i normally have severe pain in my neck especially when i first get up in the morning causing extremely painful headaches and migraines . this pillow has kept my neck in a suitable position , eliminating about 70-90 % of my problems
0	seriously , i do n't know how anyone can use this thing . i have had tatoos , waxing , and dental fillings , and i would rather have any and all of those before i ever try this product again . it feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin . just awful . in the products defense , i do n't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly ( god forbid you try it anywhere else , ladies ! ! ) . i was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and i gave into the pain and went back to shaving . yikes
0	my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles -- shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur
0	these are just ok , not great . i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them . the sunglasses , however , are not as sturdy , the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just can not endorse them . i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses . it 's a shame
1	i called nature made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury . their fish oil is usp tested for purity and potency . there is n't any `` mercury-free '' fish oil , however , nm contains only .01 mcg / g of mercury . very low level and certainly not toxic . i 'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently . fyi : they have a great website that contains all this information
1	these hair brushes were the rage when i was in junior high . i have had one since then . it is a great brush and lasts forever . worth the price
0	i bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working . ans i do agree , the smaller the hair straightener , the better ( i originally had a smaller one , that my salon uses , but it also stopped working ) . the light is on , and the heat comes off and on randomly . very upsetting .
1	saw this product , or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns , australia . it was selling for about $ 70 australia dollars ... ..which is still quite expensive converted to us $ . i came back to u.s. and found it on amazon for $ 15.99 , with free ship if i purchased $ 30 . so , i bought two ... ... one for myself , one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance , so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks , less the neckchains , which always used to get tangled . it 's an ingenius invention
1	i tried the ear thermometers and never could get them to work . our pediatrician used one of these `` rub across the forehead '' kind at her office during a checkup and said it was as accurate as the ear kind and much easier to use ... especially when kids have earaches ( ... grabbing an itty-bitty earlobe and sticking that hard end into the swollen , sore ear canal ? ? ? ... ouch . ) with a minute 's practice ( after reading the instructions ) , you get the hang of using it and never dread checking temperatures again
1	i love these luvs ! they are remarkably thin . easy to pull out of the wipe warmer , yet still very durable and pliable . however , they are also remarkably difficult to find locally . so buy in bulk when you can find them .
1	very convenient to use . however , since the neck band is rigid and does not fold , it is difficult to carry
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head , they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head . another thing , they did not look cool at all , they were ridiculous looking , nothing like the photoshopped pictures
1	i absolutely love this little book light . it is so slim and easy to store , plus i can use it for my magazines and paperbacks . i highly recommend this item . a++
0	i purchased this item the middle of may . it is now oct. 1st and it wo n't heat up anymore ! product should last longer than 5 months !
1	although i am a writer who composes on the computer , i often do my editing on hard copy in a comfortable chair . until i started using the posture-rite lap desk , i could not do this comfortably . now i have it , it fits my lap perfectly , i use it and love it . i recommend it highly .
0	i use three razors . last year 's model of this braun , a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors . ok , now , let 's do some math . i get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor . i pay , on average , 40c or so for a disposable razor . that is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream . at a nickel a shave , it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $ 150 . would take me over 8 years . now , anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor ( not even the expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) is dreaming . the blace does a much better job and much faster . but , sometimes , they can irritate the skin , but electrics can too . i can get irritated by both , sooooo , i rotate between them , and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well . i bought this braun ( last year 's model ) after reading the positive reviews here , and later bought a rotary razor . the basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter , shaves just as well , and cost me about 1/3 the price . the only thing that is better in the braun is the battery lasts longer . it is possible also , that in some cases , it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary , but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times i go over them . the braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer , like when i have two to three days growth . the rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush . the cleaning machine/charger that comes with the braun is a joke . yes , it cleans the razor great , but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom . even then , say you have that larger space , you can pay between $ 5.00 and $ 8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges . i have found they last about a month before drying out . add $ 60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor . the rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water . finally , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade . so i am constantly locking the blade position by accident . inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price . do n't get me wrong . this razor shaves fine . it works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . but for $ 50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $ 150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade . does the price difference sound rational to you ? if it does , click `` proceed to order ''
0	i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv . after using proactiv for a month , then trying this stuff , acnefree does n't compare to proactiv . granted , this is better than a bar of soap , but it 's definately worth spending the extra $ 20 to get proactiv .
0	i ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover , instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well , they do have a different cover , but the listing on amazon did n't say that the pads shut-off after one hour . i am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself , and do n't need/want any auto shutoff . these two heating pads are going right back . i can get the regular heating pads that do n't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price
0	i bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for christmas . he has wanted ones that we 've seen in the mall , so this seem to be a good one . well , the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy . we had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in . once we got it in , the head tripper felt great . it really did send goosebumps down my spine . the only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off , litterally the next day after giving it to him . it first was bent and then finally broke all the way off . i do not recommend this product . i was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them . you can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short
1	i bought this dryer based on other people 's review . it is an excellent dryer . the air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did . i did n't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers ... however , since it dries my hair fast , my arms do n't mind the weight . : ) 2 thumbs up in my book ! !
0	i can not agree with any person who gives this over 1 star . the main problem i had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department . i swear , it was like bathing in gatorade . and while i 'm sure that axe was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory , but the smell is far too fragrant . and if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality , think again . i was a lot happier with snake peel
0	i ordered this and , while i 'm a fan of other therabeads products , i found this poorly designed . unless you have a very thick neck , the velcro straps are worse than useless . they either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover . the only way i could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck -- and then it did n't cover the neck well .
1	these bars are absolutely fantastic . they are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein ( 20g ) . they taste pretty good , far better than most bars . i prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor . out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream , next being the peanut butter , and then chocolate . a chocolate mint flavor has just been released but i have yet to try it . i recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out
0	hair dryer worked good for about 1 year . then the switch broke , fused in the open position.i would not buy an andis product again
1	this product is so good for you . i sprinkle it on my cereal , salads , in yogurt , etx . a nice nutty flavor . and the health benefits are outstanding . i highly recommend this product
0	i bought these clippers for cutting hair at home . even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair . the charge does n't last through one haircut . the trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut , and they do n't trim evenly . i finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . i was extremely disappointed in it
0	i was very eager to use this product . i had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and i thought this would be a great replacement . i was a little disappointed when i had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before i could get full power . my disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses . we can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle . i had big hopes for this product but all i got was a big disappoinment
0	read some reviews that say `` my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day , '' and ask yourself - would n't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day ? ! this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value . if you wo n't drink water and exercise unless you have `` special '' water imbued with mythical powers , than by all means , this is the product for you . but if you prefer to save your money , simply exercise , eat healthier , and drink regular tap water
1	i have a waterpik that i 've used for years . after a while the tips will break . try finding them in a store- not ! welcome amazon ! they have the waterpik replacement tips for a reasonable price . if you go to waterpik online they double the price due to shipping ! ! ! amazon rocks
0	tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient `` acetaminophen '' . acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain , making it a great headache reliever , or a medication that treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc . it also acts to reduce fever . acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin . one drawback of acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction ) . it has few side-effects . those with liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , as it is hard on the liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of reye 's syndrome and aspirin in children . tylenol is the manufacturer 's proprietary name for acetaminophen . there is a generic form of acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter , and this version is much cheaper than `` tylenol '' , and the container usually contains more tablets/pills , etc . the generic form of acetaminophen is just as effective as tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action . for example , tylenol pm has diphenhydramine ( the active ingredient in benadryl ) , which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine , so it work for itching and allergies too . tylenol is packaged in different strengths : extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , and children 's dose of 80 mg. tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version , called `` extended release '' . rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach , the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract . all in all , acetaminophen is a great product . if you want a `` name brand '' of acetaminophen , tylenol is your brand ( although it will cost more ) . my choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen . jim `` konedog '' koenig
0	ok , i 'll admit , the nail clippers rock . i have no problem using them , they are sharp , cut evenly and are the perfect width . that said , throw everything else out . the bulb syringe is useless , keep the one that you get from the hospital . get an ear thermometer , it 's a heck of a lot easier . the spoon ... not even going there . the med dropper is n't easy enough to use . my suggestion ? go find a syringe with a cork attachment . you take the top off the bottle , push the cork attachment into the opening . to use , flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening , flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe . this is the best way to do it .
0	the only thing good about this item is that it is cheap . it was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly , thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times . in the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled , frizzy and puffy . this straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough
0	frankly suggest not to buy..will regret a lot after buying.. ooooo ... aaaa ... ..ouchhhh ... ..tooo painful and hair starts growing in a weeek ... and taking very loooooooooooooong timeee to finish one hand.. **************************dont buy********************
0	lcd fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker was n't stong enough . anyhow , i could push it back . then , the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top . this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual . i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken . this is the problem i ca n't fix . the only thing i can do is sending it back . following up : according to the other review , i tried to make this scale `` vibrating '' using different ways of tapping . it did n't work no matter how hard i tried . i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little ( about half an inch ) and drop it on hard floor to make enough `` vibration '' to turn it on . i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on . my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping . i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate . just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass . and also , be careful to use it in bathroom : moisture will make the glass surface slippery .
1	i really like this product because it 's compact and easy to use . now that would n't be important if it did n't work properly , but it does , so i have everything in one small , easy-to-carry package . that 's a valuable feature for one who 's on the go as much as i am . the greatest thing about this product is that it 's accurate ; i always take it to the dr 's office with me and compare his results with the results of this dynamite little monitor . i liked it so well , after i tried it , i went back and bought one for a friend who was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure . highly recommended , but i also recommend that you compare your results with your doctor 's . after all , it 's only a machine ... and like cars , you can always get a `` lemon .
0	i 've got this meter a month ago . i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise , but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest , the meter gives a reading after several attempts , but often inaccurate . you have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading . now i 'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch
1	my husband bought three pairs of these glasses , and they are the only pair that he has n't lost yet . he absolutely loves them . just keep them around his neck all day and clips them together for quick use . i think they look funny ; but who cares- they are convenient and a great product
0	if you are looking for accuracy and durability do not by this product
0	i had the exact same experience as stan , another reviewer . i bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off , i could not get it started again . like stan , i thought it was a fluke and bought another . same problem , two days after buying the pad . i have looked in four stores in the seattle area and can not find another brand of heating pad . this one should not be on the market . i am sending both pads back to the manufacturer
0	these diapers are the most awfulest things i think i ever bought for my baby . i received a lot of the `` swaddler '' size for my baby shower and i tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth . stopped using them and lo and behold , diaper rash gone . fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied . figuring that my son was older , maybe they would n't do as much harm . wrong . the rash came back with a vengeance . i had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay . i think it 's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside . definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin
1	this is the 3rd or 4th time i have bought this type of batteries and i am always satisfied with their performance . they are a great value
0	i bought this product b/c i ca n't stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs . i got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave . this product indicated i could remove hair in about the same amount of time , but that it would last much longer than shaving . i purchased it and waited a week to receive it . once i received it , i spent 40 minutes using it . in this time , i could have shaved both legs , both underarms , and my bikini line twice . using this product , i was not even done with one leg . i went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period , and it did not remove a single hair . i pressed lightly , i pressed hard , i did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach , and nothing made this product work as indicated . others may have had luck with it , but i did not . i was not impressed and i would not recommend it to anyone .
0	it looks cool , but the mister does n't work . the lights are the only thing that worked . it is very small too . i was very disappointed
0	even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback , and it weighs about the same . all the bottles are realy tiny , they look like a one time use products , the once you receive for free with your purchase , and the brush quality is not what i expected from this company . if you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it
0	it was not as good as i expected . i felt the quality of this item was cheap . therefore , i returned it
1	this has helped my wife and i to lower our cholesterol . i take it in conjunction with red yeast rice extract ( this must be taken at night ) because my numbers are very high . my wife 's numbers are right on borderline . we took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements . my numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife 's numbers went down about half of mine . ( i also take double the dose she does . ) it 's a great way to keep healthy , naturally . my father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements , also . his dangerous psa numbers ( prostrate ) even dropped radically . we do n't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was . his dr. said he 'd never seen numbers drop that much . we tell just about everyone we know about it .
1	i purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it . well made with good trim length settings , it 's also easy to hold . recommended
0	after some research online , i decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities i was looking for in a lightweight , compact model . it worked great while it lasted , but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it . one day it worked , and the next day it started smoking and sparking ! !
1	this is my second norelco wet shaver . so , yes , i like the product . here 's my rundown : pluses : - good shave - less razor burn - lot easier to insert packets ( compared to my older model ) - easy to clean minuses : - hard to get that `` patch '' under your nose - have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight - battery/power seem to wane at times - packets are expensive i 'm a cheap sob , so here 's my way of stretching out the life of the packets . wet your face first with hot water , rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion . do a first pass shave . rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver . keep a blade on-hand to get the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns . all-in-all doner likes
0	i bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it , i was not , it snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude . very unhappy with this purchase
0	while one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool , the manufacture has indeed done so . the `` spoon '' portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil . i supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility , but instead of using a fastener or weld , its just rolled metal inserted into the coil . after only two uses the `` spoon '' came out of the coil and even though i could easily enough put it back together , after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay . basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now . would recommend buying a more simply designed , single piece shoe horn .
1	purchased 15 15hp15rb heating pads that are used by dialysis patients . they are doing great
1	this is a fine , well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges -- you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom . it reminds me of tangerine lifesavers , if that helps . it 's a big bar , too , the dimensions of the bar are , in inches : 4 x 2.5 and 1.5 thick
0	only works properly if you are not moving and in a zero-gravity environment
0	i was very disappointed with this product . not only did it come in a foreign ( chinese ) box , it does n't work well at all . the `` powder '' that was included actually made it worse . if i were you , i would keep searching
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase , so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled . when i read `` chocolate pecan pie '' .. i expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate , with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base . what i received was a bar with little taste , nothing at all similar to the name on the bar . in my opinion , the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it ... the flavor is barely there . the bar is dry . it is never again be on my `` purchase '' list
0	edible taste , not the best but i would keep buying them if i did n't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea . it is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you , it is any food with sugar alcohols . all atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol . they do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do , so the theory is that they dont store fat . only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom . you only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom . not worth it
0	last month , feb.10 , i ordered one box this wipes . but when i opened it today , all bag showed the exp.12/31/2006 . i am wondering how to contact them
1	i 've found the omron very easy and practical to use . it gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and bmi ( body mass index ) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program . for the money , it would be difficult to find something better
1	these glasses are a great idea . however , they do not work with long hair . the back `` strap '' of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose ( so you can see over them for distance ) . long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back , making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes . i guess most people who need reading glasses do n't have long hair
1	these wipes are just as soft and durable as pampers , but much less expensive ! they are not alcohol-free , unfortunately - though i have noticed that those wipes which are alcohol-free contain citric acid ( fyi ) . quick , free delivery
1	this replaced a similar wrist cuff meter which i was not happy with . the old meter would give very different readings on measurements made minutes apart . this meter yields essentially the same numbers for second measurements . out of curiosity , i took it with me to my doctors office , used his large cuff ( i have very large arms ) and compared the readings to his equipment . total difference was about 3 % , a quite acceptable tolerance for my home measurement . another reviewer was unhappy with the screen size and position on the bottom of the wrist . if the unit is operated as shown in the instructions , the screen size and position are perfect , the unit is at heart level , and is quite easy to read . overall , for home use and serious data collection and blood pressure monitoring , i like this device
1	love it , love it , love it ! it got my hair soooooo straight and in record time . i highly recommend this product . esp . for african american hairtypes . : -
0	when i opened the trimmer , one of the attachments broke when i attempted to remove the cover ... if i ca n't return it to amazon , i will throw it into my garbage
0	ordered this item on sept 28 . they were supposed to ship it within 1 week . after 1 week i received an email , they said they needed 2 more weeks . another email today ( nov 7 ) , they think they can deliver it by november 27 . that 's 2 months after i placed my order . at this point , i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year . fortunately with amazon , they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order , which is what i am going to do right now
1	i think that they are great diapers . i have used other diapers in the past and i am now sitcking with luvs ! ! ! ! i get more for my money and they work great .
0	first , know this , it is a trimmer not a shaver ! with the included height attachment , your bound to have a little fuzz still left . without the attachment , you get closer results , but still very visible hair lines . i am quite disapointed with the product , because it runs on two aaa batteries , the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles . this lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you . i would certainly not recommend this product , but might be necessary if you 'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild .
1	my husband said it is a very good shaver . it took a few days to get used to the shaving head because he has always used the norelco shavers with three rotating heads . the braun is a closer shave . the cleaning system works very well and it is easy to handle
1	i have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies , i have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks ! ! my son still fits in the size % diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it , no leaks , no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning !
0	this bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true . what is also true is that is contains more fat . what you will notice with the first bite , is that the bar seems somehow `` inflated '' . there is an emptiness to consistency of the bar . you are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a myoplex or apex bar . stick with those brands for pure nutrition and far better taste . these metrx bars leave you feeling as though you 've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert , yet these will not be mistaken for desserts
1	this product is great for injury and leg elevation . my grandmother had a hematoma on her leg and she said that her `` legs do n't fall asleep anymore and they feel so good . '' my grandmother has had two strokes and this is just the relief that she needs . my mother has fibromayalgia and i 'm ordering two for her as well . she `` test-drove '' them before giving a set to my grandmother and this will be a great holiday gift for her
1	this writting instrument is superb in it 's ability to compensate the energetic writer
1	i purchased this for my wife for christmas and she loves it ... as do i . it is n't too 'perfume-y ' and smells terrific
1	this product perfrorms as expected , and very easy to clean with almost not maintenance . it also has an adjust dial for the humidity , which gives you some control . love the machin
1	the product was a gift for my mother who needs extra circulation in her feet . she loves it and it has helped increase the circulation
1	i 've used this for quite some time now and really like it . i do n't have the trouble with the toilet flushing that others seem to - but i suppose if you have one of those one-gallon regulated toilets , you 'd probably have some trouble with this paper . it is thicker and tons softer , but it does a wonderful job too on things like runny noses , running cat 's eyes , cleaning the bathroom sink , mirror , you name it . it 's pretty strong stuff and i highly recommend it
1	i 've used hot air brushes for a couple years . this works better than my last . the low setting and the larger brush works better for me . the high setting blows the hair off the bristles . it 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though . i believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron
0	too hard to use . so i paid $ 50 for an $ 18 hairdryer ; maybe if i watched the video , i could use it bette
1	this booster cushion that you fill with water works very well in the spa . it is comfortable to sit on and saves wear on bathing suits . you need to put in in the spa while it is heating otherwise it is cold to sit on . it is a good product .
1	just bought this showerhead i have a stand -up shower built in with a pull around curtain . all other heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor . this is the one . it works great . i have a shallow well pump with 40 -60lbs of water pressure setting . my wife loves this so much i will get one for her up stairs full shower bathtub
1	i have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout for meal replacement to keep up protein intake . i read alot about mixing whey with coconut water that is how i have been taking it ( blended with a couple ice cubes ) . if you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take , i do i actually look forward to the shake
1	i bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser ( well , the pink one was my idea ) and this is by far the best product i 've ever used . i even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great - and it 's usually a nappy , tangled mess after i work out . there really is nothing better than the chi for straight , silky hair . i 've used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it . it 's worth the price
0	i really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that i 'm not too happy about . the filter does n't `` lock '' down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out , the filter plops out of the top , causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher . it 's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it 's worth . the other brita pitcher i have , the filter locks into place and does n't do this .
1	nice mirror . good magnification . solid construction . my only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall . i had to move a picture to position it at the correct height
1	i had been using a spring scale for years and it was fine until i went to a friend 's house and saw what i was missing . i put that scale on my wish list that day . this is a lightweight , fairly compact scale with `` on/off '' `` tare '' and `` grams/ozs . '' buttons . it has a clear , plastic , removable bowl for measuring and says it can weigh up to about 3lbs . and down to 1/4 oz . i like it for its slim design its ease of use and for its easy clean up
1	the dispencer is easy to `` squeeze '' amount of moisturizer needed for one application . consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply , it 's very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist uv and aging ! very convenient . but just a little bit on the high side for over counter cosmetics for my opinion
1	the pills really do work . i stopped taking stacker over a year ago and i stopped my routine workouts and i gained 40 lbs in just one year ! i was so frustrated and dissapointed at myself so i started going to the gym but i was finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything while at the gym . i just started taking stacker3 for one week and already i have dropped almost 10 lbs ( of course with excersise as well ) this pill not only helps with energy but as i have read , it also works as a metabolism enhancing property ! thank you nve for a great product . the only negative thing about it is that i sometimes feel dizzy and a numbness to my fingers . ( that was the reason i stopped taking it in the first place but its really not life threatening or as serious as it may sound )
1	this product rocks , if you are serious about body building this is a must have ... i 've been using no-explode about two weeks and seen some serious enhanchments.. first of my workout lasts at least an hour longer than usual and still have energy left over . combine this product with the right amount of protein shake you are good to go ... also note that this product does not cause any stomach cramping or aching like other creatine products do and tastes great
1	works great and with any mattress . due to severe neck injuries i can now sleep better at a slight incline . thanks ...
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money . the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars , is that i think the one i bought for my mom ( same brand and model ) is slightly more accurate . a great way to track your fitness overall
1	great smell . worth the cost . cleans great . i have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and happy .
0	i have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this memory foam . after using it for one month , i have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in . i do not like the memory foam at all . it seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and i am not that heavy a person , 160 lbs . it is so hard to find foam rubber but i will search until i find it and never by memory foam again ! doubt i can get my money back . have not talked to the seller about it
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch , however , it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate . the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack . i had intended to use it as a cold mask only .
1	this edger is a perfect match with the wahl beard mustache trimmer . you can do a real professional job with these two items . robert paul jone
0	item was not received . there was a mix up and it was sent to the wrong address . i hope i 'm not billed .
0	this little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it . i assumed , since wahl has a long-time history of manufacturing grooming products , that this would be a quality item . was i ever wrong . this trimmer is constructed poorly and does n't cut hair . it will be heading to the trash
0	although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .
0	i paid $ 45 for this aesthetically pleasing scale . sure it looks nice , but if it does n't do its job , it 's not much of an accessory for the bathroom . it took me a while to figure out how the scale works . there are a lot of beeps involved . essentially , to program your info , you start by pressing the mode button , adjust your height , press mode , adjust your age , press mode , select your gender , press mode , select between normal and athlete , press mode and you will hear a beep to confirm . then to store , press either the up button for memory # s 1,3 and 5 or the down button for # s 2,4 and 6 , press mode and there will be another beep to confirm . still with me ? if you just want your weight , you just step on the scale , but if you want to get your body fat and water % , you must press the up or down button to find your memory # , then press mode and wait for the beep before you step on the scale . now i do n't know about you , but this procedure is a lot more cumbersome than any other scale i owned . so fine , i 've now figured out how to work the thing . getting even somewhat accurate results are another thing . when i stepped on the scale , i would sometimes be surprised by the weight . i did n't think i could gain 7 pounds in one day ( i eat very healthy and my weight range is usually between 3-4 pounds ) . but if you step on the scale again , like some other digital scales , it seems to remember your last weight and wo n't give you your real weight . so i have to put some other object on it to get a reading and then the scale resets . i step on the scale again and my weight is now 6 pounds less than the original reading ! the body water % did n't fluctuate too much and the body fat % was 3 % higher than the reading on the last scale i owned ( conair thinner brand ) . all in all , i am returning this scale and going back to the drawing board in finding something that is even the least bit accurate .
1	it is very easy to use , turns on very quickly , and seems to be quite accurate . i also love that there are no extras required ( e.g. , ear tip covers ) . the kids want to have their temperature taken
0	though the description of this product says it 's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice , mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat . i used them once and then packed them away because i do not like the odor . i wish the mitts had been unscented . perhaps over time , or by next winter , the odor will be gone and i 'll get some use out of them
1	this give an excellent finish to a shave . i strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well . apply hot water to dilate your pores , then apply the oil , then shaving cream , shave , and finally the after shave balm . the oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience . your face feels incredibly smooth afterward . i do n't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone , but i do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after
1	nicely designed. , effecitve , close shave , very reasonable cost , but..could they tell you simply how to turn it on ? embarassed to admit , took me almost 15 minutes to figure out the on/off feature
1	i have had omord hr-100c for a few months now . i use it wile on my treadmill . it seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate ; i think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin . i did have some trouble with the unit when i first started using it ; i replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem . the fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons i picked the omord brand . the hr-100c is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor
1	first of all , let me say this product is great in almost every way . so if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat , go for it . my main complain about the grossan hydro pulse is that it is noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided to produce his own machine and , if i 'm right , viajet is making it for him . viajet sells the same machine , except for the grossan tip , at about -again- a half the price of the hydro pulse . the breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive ( i have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country ) . so what makes the hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health is a business , after all . other than that , like i have said , this product is great for almost any respiratory problem . i used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle , and is intended to use it over 50 times . the hydro pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime , so you get the idea . also , if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment , look for the buteyko method
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose . i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all ; as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in `` so i married an axe murderer '' . the idea/concept is great but ... i 'll probably return them . unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them . people with really big heads , caveat emptor
0	molly , daughter or richard- i usually write positive reviews on this site but not this time . why on earth do dermatologists recommend this s*** ? last year my hormones were all out of wack and i had a period for a whole month . i broke out severely as one would expect . dermatologists ( including mine ) swear by this aweful chetaphil . i hate it ! it wasnt strong enough for my skin . it made my acne even worse if you can imagine ! i 'd been using it for four months when i finally decided enough was enough and i started using neutrogena frangrance free facial cleanser . that change made all the difference in the world ! i still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe acne . now its mostly just old , light scarring and the occasional breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period . one of my friends is a dietition and she also has used cetaphil and didnt like it at all . please do not buy cetaphil even if your dermatologist recommends it . you will totally regret it
0	sorry to say , but this product did not work as promised . the black canister does not hold any type or brand of lather can , only gel type cans . i did call the customer service number and asked why this is , and the rep told me that it is a type - o on the package . in order to use with a lather can , you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is . the older model product did fit the lather type cans , but this one does not . sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can , you might want to get the older white model . the product looks starange when you cant use the black canister as pictured .
0	amazon is claming : * great entry-level charger system * charges four aa / aaa nimh batteries in 6-10 hours * includes four 2300mah nimh aa batteries it is only 1800mah which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards , while if it was as amazon claims it would have been a nice step up . shame on amazon , oversight or misrepresentation . charger is cheaply made . it can charge 4 aa or only 2 aaa . poor design . the charger that came with my camera can do 4 aaa , go figure . get something else .
0	results were never consistent . many `` err '' readings . i was definitely no satisfied
1	it is not one of the stain removers , which instantly gets rid of the stain . so when you spill over something over your t-shirt , you got to spill this tide stain remover on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth wouldnt be clogged with stain but its not an immedieate relief solution
0	i ordered this scale for a blind senior citizen . the english speaking voice has a british accent and is difficult to understand . the scale wobbles when you stand on it making you feel unstable , especially for someone with impaired eyesight
0	i simply love most all of olay products..especially the regenerist line ... until i bought the tone enhancer . it did nothing for my face . not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin . i guess i will use it as a moisturizer until it 's gone .
0	as far as i can tell , even after following directions to the letter , i found the readings to be wildly inaccurate . for example , in the morning i got a reading of 89 over 79 . in the afternoon it was 188 over 155 . then a bit later it was 155 over 150 , nearly a flat line indicating death . at my doctor 's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78 . it 's a wonder this little machine did n't cause me to keel over just from shock . i do n't recommend it to anyone . mine is on its way back to amazon
1	my husband was totally delighted with the rollator walker . it is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone would n't want this new , much more attractive kind . it folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things . when folded up it fits in the back seat of our car , and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large . we put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great , what more can you ask
1	easy on the back and shoulders , as this is very light . it does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming . my 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy ! i bought this in a drug and discount store for $ 13.95 . it 's worth that
1	we love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth and it has so much more power than our old brush
0	do n't waste your money on this size . go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel . the absorbency is good but there 's no way it will fit around a head . also , i 'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either
1	it cost a little more , but it 's worth it . it keeps the last 5 temperatures so you can compare
1	a friend of mine used to meet me for lunch while boasting a beautiful glowing face from a $ 50.00 facial she had just received . this product ( even after the 1st use ) produced the same results i never had to leave my home . my skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat . my skin feels looks like i 've lost about 7 years time . i 'm very , very pleased with olay . i 've used their total effects lotion for years i did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit . this is an excellent exfoliant hands down , the best skin regenerating product i 've ever used
1	have used this product on myself for many years when particapating in ultra endurance cycling events , as well as on my family when vacationing in tropical area 's where the sun will cook you quickly without adequate sun protection . do not be fooled by thinking you will not get tanned by using spf 45 or better . that is a misconception ... why not walk away from your experience in the sun without the discomfort of sun poisoning . found best result 's when put on indoors prior to being in the sun .
0	i never received this item -- nor could i get a response from the company when i asked about it . my opinion -- rip off
0	i also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months . i really loved this machine though ! it actually blew air ! and it has the nice safe switches unlike the toggles that most have now . i had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while i was gone and almost burned the place down . so anyway , i 'm trying to contact the manufacturer , but i doubt it will do any good . too bad . loved it while it worked . hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before i saw the reviews
1	i found this product to be very unique , and helpful , in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck . being far-sighted , i have come to need reading glasses , and these are perfect for my needs . i can look 'down ' through them , and look 'over the frame ' for distance , all while they are secured around my head and neck . i do hiking , using a gps device , and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand , while also looking forward towards my path of travel . thank you for the innovative product
0	i quite liked this trimmer while it worked well , so i 'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months . as of now the battery will hold barely any charge , if at all . it 's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions
1	i purchase two of the eva-dry edv-500 renewable dehumidifer and hang them inside the closet where i store my photo gears . although in california is not so humid but little moisture do add up . this dehumidifer is so easy to use -- unwrap it then hang it there . i check them once per several day . when the silica gel change from blue to pick , i just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight , then next morning , wow , a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again . the changing of color is very obviously . i strongly recommend this item
0	this product must work for some people but obviously not for everyone . i started this 1 month ago , using it as directed with normal diet regular exercise , i 've gained 8 pounds ! on the up side , the price was low ordering thru amazon , so i would recommend if you 're really interested go ahead try it , maybe it will work for you
0	i have used three of these . the first two each lasted a year before shorting out . i kept buying them because i liked the cordkeeper function . this last one , though , shorted out and started a fire . i have notified the company and will see what happens . but i doubt that i will purchase another . it 's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market .
1	read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child 's nusery . i absolutely love it . before this , my son could not sleep well with our `` family 's '' humiifier because it was too noisy . within an hour of bringing this home , it was set up ( very easily ) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that week ! no filters , no noise , no problems thus far ! i did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath , but the humidifier was near a window , and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top . ( the problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop ) filling it is a snap and the very fine mist ( looked like small stream of fog ) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal ! the tank seems to last longer than the box states . it is on it 's third day on a low/med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top . i love the safety features and i do n't have to worry about the tank still on if it 's empty since it has an automatic shut off ! the light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room . it is a design that will last thoughout his childhood ! thank you crane !
1	we received these cards as a christmas gift . they are very well made . the quality is outstanding . some have beads on them and some have details that you can not get on a card without spending a fortune for them . well worth it to buy them . you wo n't be disappointed !
1	compared to the conair 1,600w i have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high-pitched when i first turned it on , but you may have a high-pitched blow dryer now -- compared to my old conair -- and wo n't notice a difference . it does n't have a cold air feature , which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair ; or like me , in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable . these two drawbacks , especially having only the hot at high or low setting , is why i give it four out of five , instead of five out of five star rating . pluses : price -- for $ 13 it ca n't be beat for the frugal shopper ; efficiency -- it blowdries my hair a bit faster than the conair did though i do n't understand the science behind that ; appearance -- it 's cute and compact ; weight -- a toddler could wield this blow-dryer with ease ; carrying ease -- small enough to fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag , under the sink , et cetera . i have n't had this long enough to rate how durable it is , so i hope someone who 's owned one for at least a year comes on to write , `` it 's still going strong .
1	this dryer works great but it gets pretty hot . watch your ears and fingertips
0	now i try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum , like in tea . i do not drink coffee . so when i took stacker 3 ( just one pill ) i was jittery and could not fall asleep . i stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day . i felt nauseus too . now this was probably because i do n't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it , but i do n't recommend stacker 3 anyway
1	i love this product . it just tastes great especially with milk .
1	these are marvelous ! ! i had gotten a different style last february for mothers , ,these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids ... i love the snap strap and the pouch . now all of my children want them , too ! ! also love the up to date colors !
1	these are very tasty . they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you . they also are great in a diaper bag , purse , center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination
1	i rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars because i have not used it enough to know if it does everything it claims ... .however i have been amazed at how this little contraption does wonders on my back . when i first got this lumbar extender i set up up in about 2 seconds and then stretched backwards to lay on it . omg , as i laid down it was like i could n't even breath for a brief second . to actually feel my back being forced into shape nearly took my breath away as all the muscles were pushed around . i had to relax and it was amazing how sore the muscles in my back were from leaning over my computer at work . having used it for about a month now , my back has started to feel much better and i am sleeping better too
0	i really enjoyed my nano chi iron while it lasted ( rip 7/06-11/06 ) , it handles well , it 's a great straightener , and it 's a pretty color . however , i dropped it approximately two feet , onto a carpeted floor , and it stopped working . i purchased the chi about four months ago and think that a $ 120 iron should be a bit more resiliant . i 'll still purchase chi products , but would n't recommend investing in the nano technology just yet ... there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out , and it 's not worth having to pay an extra $ 35 to have it repaired
0	i first bought the standard , and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well . i used them riding a bike in the winter months . neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit . for the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering ( and prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above the ear . the rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists .
0	this pillow is soft and sqwishy , but it is too small . also , there is a vibrator inside that does n't work . i just cut out the battery case and use it once in a great while
1	i received this for christmas from my amazon wishlist . i wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing . i was a long time user of norelco shavers , but switched to a blade since i could n't get a close enough shave . now that the whiskers are mostly gray , you ca n't tell for a few days if i shaved or not , so closeness is no longer an issue . i typically use this shaver in the shower , and have noticed that if you wash your face first , it takes more of the cool skin creme to give a smooth , close shave . just a hint , guys . for the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles , dimples and adam 's apple cleanly with very little drag . my only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the 'stash sideburns while showering . small complaint that does n't remove any ratings stars . all in all a great shaver
1	dr. bonners pepperming soap is our favorite . our sensitive skin does not react , it lasts a long time , and best of all , the peppermint aroma wakes up our senses in the mornings
1	i mean come on , who needs 5 blades right ? well , after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the mach iii was over a twin head razor , i decided that $ 10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so i took the plunge , and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations . the first thing i noticed was that this new fusion has a more powerful engine than the mach iii . the second thing i found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the mach iii , and with very little effort , and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore . and i find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about . but i do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what i mean . haw haw 5 blade
1	they do n't seem small at all . i would agree that it 's like a size 3 , if you 're talking about toddler clothing , but the diaper size is different . my daughter wears 3t clothes , size 5 easy ups
0	these wipes clean well . they arrived promptly . they stink something fierce . i can not stand the way they smell .
0	this heating pad was received as a gift to replace the sunbeam heating pad i had used for 35 years and had finally worn out . i was delighted with the larger size , but the new pad did not heat at all . i returned it to homedics ( along with the $ 5 handling charge ) , and two months later they sent a replacement . the replacement heats up , but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted . it almost looks like it has melted to itself , and it ca n't be flattened out . i wo n't be sending this one back with another $ 5 handling charge -- it is n't worth it . this one goes out with the trash , and i go back to sunbeam .
1	this was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit . i had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up . they love it ! ! ! not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap , shampoo , etc. , my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well
1	my mother is 87 and the shower chair makes it easier . she likes it in the tub better and i just use warm water poured over her
0	i got this device to help me clean around my place . i thought it would be easy to use , and it is not . the pads do not stay on . when you are trying to put them on , the solution leaks all over you . after working on my shower , i saw no difference . i wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth .
0	contrary to purported performance claims , my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of duracell 's products . decades of experience with everready energizers - and with other duracell products ( e.g. , coppertops ) - show procell products to be markedly inferior in performance . regardless of how long their shelf life may be , they simply have n't performed up to par , much less equally to other alkaline batteries . this has just been my experience - over daily use , over many months , with set after set of procell aa batteries . take it for what its ' worth
1	purchased as a christmas gift for a friend who uses this product , he was excited to receive this . i was excited that i was able to purchase it at a considerable savings over department store prices . this same product in a smaller size retails for $ 45- $ 55 locally and i was able to purchase him a larger bottle for less than $ 30 . this particular item by davidoff is not always easy to find and i was glad to not only find it here but to find it at such a reasonable price
1	i lost six pounds in eleven days . i started out taking one-half pill in the morning and one-half in the afternoon . i was wary of any reaction . i now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon . that 's enough for me . i have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise . no side effects whatsoever . my problem was the munchies at night watching tv -- and that craving is gone . i highly recommend this product
0	the scale is already broken . it just reads `` lo '' when you step on it , and i just got it a couple of weeks ago . it worked for about a week and a half
1	my kids really liked how it did n't feel like suntan lotion
1	i 'm sixty years old and i have been using this product for years . when i had my yearly physical the doc ask me if i used anything because my skin looks so good . roc delivers ! ! !
1	i have n't actually used the bottles sent to me as of yet but used this product all last summer . i love the fact that the blue lizard suncream stays on so well . my kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and blue lizard does the trick ! ! ! i do n't think they got burnt one time last year while i was using this . great product ! !
0	order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time . i do not know how long because i am still waiting
0	broke after two uses . not worth the time to put back together
0	i had to return my recent purchase due to a defect . i have used waterpik dental water jets for many , many years and typically have to replace every two or three years . i was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet . i purchased the waterpik ultra , and i am pleased with the design , size and operation thus far . i just hope waterpik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service
1	i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time
1	did n't work if you dont take the full recommended amount . it may have helped me feel fuller , but it didnt help me lose any weight . i pulled out the old excersize bike and am plugging away at a low 20 min a day now . i still use it for the caffeien and possible apetite control benefit
0	after 5 days of minimal use , this pad stopped working . kaz replaced it . after 3 days of use , the pad stopped working again . kaz replaced it again . after 7 days of use , the pad stopped working a third time , but this time kaz voided the warranty ! then , they said i should get an electric blanket if i wanted to keep warm . i wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache
0	this item did n't work very well . it was n't a close shave at all . i used it twice before my dog chewed it up . it left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it .
0	made of cheap plastic . generate loud noise . the switch broke off the 2nd week i got it .
0	this is a sad invention . instead of massaging , it vibrates and in no way `` relieves stress '' . besides this , it 's very low budget : first off , the label for a `` thigh massage '' , actually vibrates at you calves ( on the ottoman ) . where it is labeled `` lumbar '' , it actually massages your thighs . when you try the pre-designed massages ( `` modes '' ) , the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots . the whole thing is almost musical . whoever designed this chair should try a different profession . besides all this , the chair itself is fairly comfortable , and the heat is nice , although a little weak
1	i have tried many contact lens solutions , and this one works the best for me . since switching to acuvue 2 disposable lenses a couple of years ago , i noticed that my eyes did not maintain their moisture as well as with my former daily wear lenses . some solutions burned my eyes even after rinsing my lenses in saline , but the optifree is truly different for me , helping to clean my lenses daily and seemingly helping to maintain their flexibility and comfort all day . although i still rinse the optifree off of my lenses with saline before wearing them , i have found no irritation . and , even better , daily rinsing and overnight storage in the optifree help me to extend the life of my disposable lenses for several weeks beyond what i could without using it . that saves money because i have to purchase lenses less frequently . give it a try , especially at this price ! wow
0	i thought they might 've improved the hgm 15 model . forget about it . both models are lousy . buy foreign . it might work better
0	this grinder was recommended to me , but i have to say i find it frustrating to use . juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit , and grinding some things ( e.g. , green beans ) takes a lot of force . while the price is fine , the high cost of `` shipping and handling '' to purchase one unit made me angry ; had i noticed before i bought it , i would n't have ! since then i 've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores
1	this is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone . the biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you will make progress whether your goals are stress reduction , better meditation , building higher self-esteem , maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc ... the `` biofeedback events '' are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use ! most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few `` easter eggs '' which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem , realize your goals etc ... much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved ( though there are a few cheesy moments ) . that said the interface etc . needs help , it can be downright frustrating , and the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens . thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack wisdom quest , which i also highly recommend . overall , this is a really innovative and great product . also a good investment as far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more expansion packs and third-party software to come
0	this is the worst waste of money i have ever had . the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups . 3x magnification ? ? ? more like 9x ! ! ! you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors . my suggestion would be not to waste your money on it . its a joke
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele . the fusion is a classic example , from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel . do n't buy into the hype , the fusion is an expensive joke of a product .
1	i purchased the caruso for my wife after returning a conair infinity . the conair infinity did not measure up to her expectations . she is happy with the caruso and feels that it does an good job setting curl . i will offer a few observations of my own . i would think that companies that produce these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader spectum of customer . for instance , women have different lengths of hair . this device provides 6 petite , 6 small , 6 medium , 6 large , 6 jumbo . that might be fine for women with shoulder length hair , but not for everyone . there 's not enough of one size to get the job done . there 's not enough of two sizes to get the job done . if your hair has just been cut , it 's to short to use the larger sizes , unless you have long hair to start with . my wife 's hair is not quite shoulder length , she 's got a problem . so , i figured , no big deal , just order a dozen of the right size . one dozen additional rollers cost $ 35 . i only paid $ 29 for the unit with 30 rollers . that 's not what i call customer friendly .
1	okay , i have n't owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years , but i must say , this one is exactly perfect and has everything i would ever want in a hair dryer . it has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly , leaving it soft and frizz-free . i highly recommend this product
0	the first shave seemed good ; but the second time did me in with the fusion . instead of just one nick , i managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once . but looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock . i got a merkur heavy duty double edge safety razor the blades are a huge savings . merkur blades or feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece . the feather blades are extremely sharp ! the gillette sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry . a good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor , a badger hair shaving brush , some proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable relaxing for me !
0	. i would like to give 0 stars . i 've got one battery for more than $ 8 with s. h. they say 12 batteries . do not make the same mistake i made . they will send you only one battery , not 12
1	kama sutra massage oil in the 8oz bottle is really good stuff ! keeps the skin so smooth and the girlfriend happy lol just make sure you warm it up alittle before squirting it on . you will live longer
1	this has helped me more than i can say . it has helped with a death of a very close relative . without this i would n't be able to lead a normal day at my high level stress job .
0	i purchased this because it was so cute , and had the conair name . within 6 weeks , the bulb blew out , and i started looking for a replacement . ive been to all the local places , and everyplace i could find online . in an obscure place i found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage . the only place i could get the correct bulb was on the conair website -- but they make you buy 10 bulbs , then charge $ 9.00 for handling . the cost is more than just buying a new mirror ! a rip off
1	shaving gives me all sorts of problems , i must have super sensitive skin or something . i can not afford laser and wax just is n't my thing . grabbed this for myself before christmas on a whim . it was money well spent ! after 3 months of use , i have gotten the hang of the product . i suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more . say , run the product over each leg once till you get used to it . then trying to completely remove the hair . my legs are unbelievably soft . no rash , one little tender area after i spent too much time there . do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case . i still have trouble around my ankles . hair regrowth is markedly thinner since i began using it . by about half . what remains still grows long but i 'm , err , what does one call this process ? - doing it once a week and only takes a few minutes
0	this thing does n't massage , just vibrate , and two of the motors died quickly . although the product is supposed to be covered by 2 year warrenty , the customer service is non-existent . stay away from this , definitely not worth the money
0	i bought this product with great expectations that it would save my not-so-inexpensive victoria secret bras from excessive wear in the washing machine . it does do this , though the product is not very user friendly when your bra is fairly large cupped . i suppose if you have smaller cupped bras , this device works wonderfully . as for the larger dd or bigger cups , you have to tuck and there is a large overlap on the smaller interior ball . also , another problem i have found is that the larger cups with underwire are really hard to use with this ball . again , due to the size of the larger cups . otherwise , i would think that this is a great product for use with smaller cupped bras
0	i 've used much better electric shavers in the past . i find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin .
1	i love the idea of the glasses always being where i can find them . the only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide the band is . every time i look up the magnets pop apart . if they fix that , i 'd give them 5 stars ! !
0	out of the box did n't work . would not have givin it a 1 star review if there was a zero . now its time to play the refund game .
1	i got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it 's great . i know i should probably replace the head by now , but it still seems to work fine , so i do n't . i 've only changed the battery once . if you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type , this is it . then again , if you 're not lazy or weak , you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries
0	this product almost had me going to the er . i felt a little flush so i used this monitor to check my blood pressure . it was 151/98 . a second check showed 148/100 . i then really started feeling flush as a wave of burning flushed my body . my wife an rn said calm down , breath deeply . i went over to my rottweiler and started hugging and petting her . after about 10 min . i felt the flushness go away but the blood pressure showed 162/99 . i made a dr 's appointment and brought the machine with me . in his office where my pressure always is elevated when he 1st takes it , i used the machine in front of him and my pressure was 153/107 . i really got nervous . he took it with his machine and it was 140/82 . you wo n't believe the relief . he took it again with another machine and it had come down to 135/80 . i 'd like to return the machine for a non-digital one . i 've seen this before with a digital machine from a different company
0	like the reviewer below , my dryer also stopped working within a short period . it was never dropped or misused -- after about a month , it simply refused to turn on when plugged in . now , there is a decent warranty for the product . however , with the money you spend on shipping and the $ 4 they request for handling/return shipping , buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal . i do n't know if the other reviewer and i got the only two lemons , but since we both found our way to amazon with this review , i would n't recommend the product to other buyers
1	they taste good and stop those hunger pangs for quite some time
0	i bought this press to do crafts . the dimensions i were given were completely wrong . i was told the product in inches ( l x w x h ) : 9.0 x 20.0 x 15.0 it really is barely 6 1/2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long , 17 inces long at the angle . it was so small that i could maybe iron one sock at a time . also , the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website
1	good product . does what it says . however , it could smell better . it has almost no scent . you smell clean ... but it has almost no scent . other than that it feels great , lathers great , leaves your skin feeling nice . and it clears your skin up
0	this morning i spilled coffee on my `` million dollar '' white dress shirt . it left me with three large coffer stains . i remembered that i had my tide to go in the car . after drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions , most of the coffee stains had disappeared ... .what remained , however , were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread . so , most of the coffee stain was gone , but i 'm left with the unsightly rings ... not quite as noticeable , but there 're still there .
0	this device works `` ok '' . jet stream is moderate . noise is considerable . has a lot of attachments that really do n't do much . i 'm not sure what the brushes even do . the dual tank function is pretty good . but lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part
0	i have bought 5 of these crappy pads and all 5 stopped working after a short period . buy the sunbeam 902 flexible heating pad -- much more reliable and useful too
0	they 're ok , but definately not as absorbent as the overnight diapers . my son soaks through if he urinates during the night
1	i was requested to write a review by amazon . i felt this request was premature since i used this product only for a month . so far i am quite satisfied with the user friendlyness , price , and ability to use and clean the shaver in wet environment .
1	i own this unit for more than a year . bought it in the local drug store for $ 20 . first unit was bad , displaying low battary error . i exchanged it same day for another one . i compared readings with traditional thermometers and found it to be very accurate , fast , and can show in both c and f. the best i 've ever had . the case is bad - lock broke in a week
0	i bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair , it takes off most of it but i dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2-3 days ... much like shaving it off . i would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day . moreover , on underarms , it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one , dont waste your money on this one
1	good shaver lots of battery life quick charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cu
0	i purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons i made at the doctor 's office . i next purchased an omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable . the wrist unit is very cool , but did not live up to consumer reports suggestion that it had acceptable validity . i 'm technically savvy , an excellent instructions follower , and really wanted to like this unit , but i can not recommend it . skip the cool wrist unit and get an arm unit if at all possible .
0	i loved the idea of the clapper . i live alone so the clapping sound would n't bother me and i looked forward to the convenience factor . my first clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working , but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short . did i learn my lesson ? oh , no ! i went ahead and purchased another clapper some months later . the night before last , the lamp i connected this one to started blinking . i checked the lightbulb and it was ok . it was only went i got down close to the clapper plugged into the outlet that i heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity . once again the clapper crapped out , this time in a different lamp , different outlet . will i never learn ? thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device . can you say `` housefire '' ? again , how dumb am i ? is the unit ul-approved and , if so , have any other complaints been lodged about it ? how does one find this out ? i like my gadgets , but `` buyer beware '' on this one
1	this has an average scent . i have bought other brands of reed diffusers that i like alot more . i would not buy this again
0	pure junk . i 've tried this several times . it does n't repair scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk . the first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface . and the second trick is to try to get your money back . the method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers .
0	these are just ok , not great . i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them . the sunglasses , however , are not as sturdy , the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just can not endorse them . i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses . it 's a shame
0	we recently bought the same model dispenser , but in the satin finish . from the first , only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work ( yes , we followed the instructions carefully ) . two months later , another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable . instead of this loser , try `` the dispenser 71450 classic iv . '' we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age . it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty , but so what -- it works , and the aviva does n't .
0	i got this product to help me sleep and it did not work for me . i used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made by members mark and that worked great , but i no longer need the pain killer . i bought this and have tried it 3 times now , and i ca n't quite explain it but it did not make me tired . it made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired , plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times i used it . not only did it not make me drowsy , i could n't sleep and i woke up several times during the night . i think i would have done better without it . but everyone reacts to drugs differently , so try at your own risk
0	i bought one and it worked great . at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot , and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot , but once you get used to it , it does a stellar job of straightening your hair . around 6 months into using the straightner , the machine slowly overheated and died . thinking i had a faulty model , i went out and bought a new one . guess what ? a few months into that one , it ended the same way . so basically , not worth it .
0	razor blades are expensive enough as it is , and the trend of `` more is better '' has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry . what 's that ? five blades , you say ? why , it must be better than four ! meh . i have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck . the good news is that , while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try , this blade does , in fact , take care of the problem . in addition to this , it aggravated the skin quite a bit ( this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades ) . the precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin ( particularly in the neck area ) . if you have sensitive skin at all , this might not be the razor for you . contrary to the experience of others , however , the extra `` trimming '' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth , under my nose , and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns . however , the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast . considering my rather fine hairs , i 'm used to exchanging blades once every week or so . now i 'm exchanging them twice a week . seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors ' products , and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the fusion razor ( and vice versa ) , and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin , i find it hard to recommend
0	the reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best , so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [ i might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured ( and no longer airborne ) housefly buzzing in circles ] . with respect to the heat ( ing ) , it does perform better , but is by no means stellar . the pro 's are its design for moisture , a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off . the con 's include , as others have said , a huge ac-dc plug/power pack , no apparent ability to wash the darn thing , only modest heat , annoying velcro straps , a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together , but ca n't be removed from the main pad for washing and , perhaps most significantly , the fact that mine died after approx . 18 months ( which , incidentally , raises yet another detractor ; the warranty is only a year , much less than many other brands )
0	please verify with amazon if they will ship your product . i ordered mine 6 weeks back and i havent recieved it till now..i wonder when they will send me the same
0	the wieght is accurate , but the body fat is way off . i had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and i was 12 % six months later i wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says i 'm 25 % . something is off and i trust the doctor . if all you want is to see your wieght its fine , but the rest ... well find another scale
1	hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushhead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards . i use the soft brushhead because i used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen , but since using the hydrabrush and the 8 brushes ( 4 on each side ) i do n't have to worry about missing when i brush my teeth . excellent product .
0	the friend who i purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too fast for her to keep up with . she is used to a two wheeled walker , but wanted one with a seat . she did n't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund . it turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund ; so she did n't return it . the lesson : better buy local if you 're not sure
0	this is an overpriced , under designed lounger . the concept is cool , the product is not . the idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses . very uncomfortable . i am glad i bought mine from amazon as opposed to the $ 200 plus other retailers wanted last summer
0	this is a nice idea , but the individual components are poor in quality . the nasal aspirator does n't get enough suction . of course , i 've never found an aspirator at the store that did work as well as the one we got from the hospital . do yourself a favor and just ask for an extra one before you 're discharged from the hospital . second , the thermometer takes forever to get a reading , and it does n't beep or anything to let you know it 's finished . the clippers are okay , but i 've definitely used better ones that were just a buck or two . never used the medicine dropper because the pharmacy gives you one for free when you get a prescription , and other baby medications ( tylenol , motrin , pediacare , etc ) come with their own specially calibrated dispensers . the medicine spoon ? give me a break . my daughter balked at that one the one time i did try to use it
1	i have tried the gerber nursing pads , and one other brand . these nursing pads are the best . i have a large supply of milk but i have not leaked through these pads , they are also very soft and they are not visible through your clothing
0	i ordered one and had it arrive totally broken . amazon sent a replacement . that too was defective . save your time/money and buy another , maybe in person . i 'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping . ( amazon is giving me a refund including shipping , so there 's not a problem there .
1	i 've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair ( and have it stay straight ) ! i am happy to say that i 've finally found something that works ! i 've had many different straighteners , and this one is by far the best . i have long curly hair , and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes . much better than the hour i 'm used to . plus , the straightening lasts . my hair stays completely flat all day , instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener . you simply ca n't get better than this !
0	i bought this based on patricia 's review and loved it for the first month , then noticed it making a strange sqeaking noise . upon closer inspection i noticed multiple welds breaking ( i 'm 185 lbs ) . now i 'm not so happy with it , no warrenty , amazon wo n't take it back . good thing i have a friend with a wire welder who can fix it for me
1	i have not been overweight for many years , but i still have that last 5-10 pounds that just will not stay off . i have several issues with eating - i tend to eat very large portions when i am really enjoying a meal , i snack a lot , and i have a major sweet tooth . this product has taken care of all 3 problems . i am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times a day . i plan to cut back a little once i 'm at my target weight . i find that this dosage will generally suppress my appetite and/or urge to eat for 3-6 hours . it 's odd for me to experience hunger without cravings and a frantic urge to eat ... but that 's what the pills do for me . most of the time i can tell i 'm hungry only because my stomach is growling and it has been several hours since my last meal ... but i do n't feel like i have to eat anything right away . i can go grocery shopping when i 'm hungry and not make poor choices , and even when i finish up at the gym after work i do n't feel ravenous anymore . i definitely get full faster . it does n't feel like it used to when i overate , i just can tell i 've eaten enough and i stop . what a concept ! and often i can just have a bite or two and be good for another 30-60 min if i 'm too busy to sit down and eat . my urge to snack has really been curbed . i still have one or two snacks most days , but they are much smaller and often more healthy . now i can actually stay up several hours past dinner without making another mini-meal , which i used to do almost every night . hoodia does not completely kill my appetite , it suppresses it quite a bit but more than anything it takes away all of my cravings . that is definitely my favorite part - i used to crave sugar from morning until night practically every day . since my first day on these pills , the only time i 've had sweets is when someone has offered me something . i 'm able to eat just a little and not wish for ten times more . it does not occur to me to go to the vending machine at work anymore , or buy candy when i 'm shopping . maybe even more than the weight loss , the emotional benefits of these pills are incredible for me . i 'm no longer berating myself constantly for overeating or having too much candy or dessert . i 'm not depressed all day anymore because my favorite pants have gotten snug , and all i can think about is why i do n't have the willpower to prevent it . i would definitely recommend this product , especially to anyone who has issues with food like i do
1	lathers well , with a pleasant ( subtle ) scent . shipping costs spoil some of the fun . you might consider barclaycrocker , given its shipping and product costs
0	the disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style . it makes my arm and finger tired
1	my hair is very wavy and frizzy , i have to condition my hair every day so it does n't look dry and damaged . 2 weeks ago i got my hair cut , the stylist used a sedu straightener on me . wow ! suddenly , my hair was stick straight and super glossy ( really brought out the natural highlights ) . i bought one from him for $ 199 ( should have checked the internet first ) . i 've tried a cheap flat iron before ; after wrestling with it for 40 minutes and pulling the heck out of my hair , all i got was slightly `` pressed '' hair . the sedu iron has super smooth ionic plates , so it glides through your hair very easily , quickly and smoothly . no more pulling of my hair . i can give myself smooth , gorgeous , in about 5 minutes . another plus is that the style will stay until the next time you wash your hair ; now i only have to straighten my hair every other day . sure , sedu is on the expensive side , but this salon-quality tool is more than worth it . look good and feel good every day !
1	love it ! love it ! love it ! it 's like a high pressure car wash. ( i do n't sound like a high pressure salesman ?
0	title says it all - it simply does not work , yes it turns and trims a hair here and there , but i would not purchase this again . i am happy with my other wahl product
0	with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking ... it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt ... .it works ok the first couple of times but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp cuz i dont want it to flake so if you have 30 $ and you want this product keep saving and get a better one ... .this product is not worth your time
0	i mostly want a bookstand that would hold a paperback book for me . this can not do that at all . however , that is not just because it is meant for large books . it ca n't really hold textbooks very well either . the one that i bought ended up in a box in storage , and i doubt i 'll ever use it again
1	i got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base . the charger part of the trimmer is just too big . even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments . he would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for
0	i used huggies pullups with my older child and started using them with my younger one . when they came out with dora on the easy ups and our grocery store had a huge dora display , my daughter had to use dora not the pullups which have the disney princess design which she is not that into ( i personally think the disney princesses are not a good choice for potty training age 2-3 year olds , i would assume that dora would be picked by more children that age ) . first off the smallest size they have is big for the average 2-3 year old . they did have a size 2t but from what i have seen it has been discountined . i do n't know if it is because they are a little big or the quality they do leak . i have never had a huggies pullup leak on me but these easy have on a regular basis . the design definetly got my daughter not wanting diapers and on the road to potty training but the leakage did n't make it easy for me . i would never use these for overnight use , pullups absorb so much better in an overnight situation . now if pampaers could make a better product or huggies could make a better design then i would be happy
1	yes , the kit is easy to use , but if you do n't bleed freely , get a few extra lancets before you start . most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free . the kit only comes with two ( which can be used only one time ) . it took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test ; i had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets ( because i 'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool ) . other than that - no complaints . the lab got the results back to me faster than expected
1	after 3 months use , i 'm buying two more of these for my daughters . the unit is compact , very sturdy , virtually silent , and puts out plenty of mist even on the low setting . the small tank is light and easy to fill , even in a bathroom sink ( many people really have to wrestle with those one gallon tanks ) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or nights sleep . the key feature is that it is small and quiet . that means it can be near you on a desk top or night table . having the mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will condense on cold windows ( and cause mildew ) . it also means you can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top . if you want to use the high setting , put the unit on top of a book shelf , dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the mist to settle . this is small and light enough to take on the road to dry hotel rooms . one daughter wants one for her dorm room , which is overheated . the unit is easily moved from bedroom to den or wherever you locate during the day . you would not find this convenient with large ( gallon ) humidifiers . this unit is also inexpensive , at around $ 30 which is half the cost of many larger models ( so you can get two ) . after using several evaporative humidifiers , i love not spending $ 6 - $ 9 a month for paper replacement wicks . overall , i am delighted with the unit . the only criticsm is the blue led is too bright in a dark room . this is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive tape over it . the light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night . it also lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the chamber . highly recommended .
0	the little radio does not have the ability for station lock-in . every time it is turned on it reverts to a station set at the manufacturer . since there are no indicators or displays it is annoying and time consuming having to constantly reset the station ( s ) . it also has lousy reception and lots of static can be heard when the radio is on
1	this is a wonderful product . it smells great as well as works great . i was worried that it would be too drying on my skin , but it was n't . it seemed to balance between where it was needed and where it was n't
0	after one year of owning this scale i replaced the batteries and it stopped working
1	i love the medi-beads products , and highly recommend them . although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto-gel , i love the moist heat and the weight of the pads . i used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients . i only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back , but 2 of the king-sized pads will do it . microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave .
1	it does what it advertises . the bodyfat readings do fluctuate , but that 's normal , it gives you a good general idea of how much bodyfat you have , and it gives a simple reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low , normal , high , too high . i got it for about 25 bucks so good buy .
0	when i gave birth i had already bought packages of newborn huggies . they were horrible . i thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then . nope . i 've tried huggies supreme and the cheap huggies . they are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them . i thought since everyone always talks about pull-ups that they would work once potty training time came around . wrong again . they leaked evertime he wore them . do not waste you money . i always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers , cruisers , and training pants . pampers are the best .
1	i love this product . its the first one i 've found where i can practically have wash and go curly hair . just put work it through damp hair and let it air dry or twist around fingers for defined curls
1	i do n't know if it makes your hair shiny or not ( i never noticed increased shine ) however , i do think it does it does a nice job . it worked better when my hair was around shoulder length , but it puts a nice curl in your hair and as long as it 's not too humid out , it stays in . now that my hair is down to my waist , it does n't hold curl anymore . just a little on the ends and if it 's even a little humid , forget it . the main thing that bothers me about this set is the clips that hold the rollers in . i do n't know what they were thinking , but they really suck . they pull on your hair a little while they 're holding the roller in and make you look an awful lot like madusa . anyone who happens to see you will most certainly have a few jokes and laughs
0	this is the best diet product ever ! i tried them all and `` skinny water ? '' is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever . the product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much . i drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away . i lost 15 lbs . in 20 days . great taste , it works great , and it 's so inexpensive . great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight . the owners should hire me to do commercials for them
1	we used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently . as a previous reviewer stated , sometimes it works , sometimes not , so i combined it with the recommended dosage for infant gas drops and that would do the trick . i found little tummy 's brand at babies-r-us , which is less expensive and is the same thing . later , after 6 months and trying new foods , there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something did n't agree with her . i gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she 'd clearly feel better
1	i suffer from upper back and shoulder tension . i 've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one i had . after looking at many warmers , i chose the happy wrap . the wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles . my yorkshire terrier ca n't wait until i 'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when i 'm finished .
1	i have to say that i have been converted . for over 15 years now i lived with a razor . i have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too . i am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon . i have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade . i have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the gillette brand is the best type of razor , but now i find it 's not the best shave . i used an electric shaver several years back , it was one of the top of the line norelco with the incorporated gel . it gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs ; i ended up having to shave as normal . -- true story -- i am a manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item i was marked bad was my personal appearance . not that i dress bad or not wear deodorant , but that they felt i did n't shave often . ( i shave at the very least every other day , usually every day ) . so i felt i had to so something about it . i researched electric shavers thinking i could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer . i found that panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had . the instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut . i have been using it for almost 30 days now , and i will not live without it . i have never had this close of a shave before . i can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow . my fiancé has found a new love for touching my face , and i seem to be getting more kisses too ! during the first 2 weeks i had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old gillette , but today officially i was able to through my gillette away for good . ( my boss has even asked what i am doing different and when i told him , he went out and bought one too , he also loves it now . my fiancé said she would leave me if i stopped using the panasonic , it 's a good thing panasonic has been around for decades ) so , i am raving about his product , but every good has its bad ... what the bad ? well , it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave , but for the amount of time i am planning to use it and the money i am saving from buying razors every month , i can handle that . the cleaning system is very good , but it takes very long to clean ( 2-3 hrs ) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles . the cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week . i have not gotten to that point yet , but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash . i just end up using the base for the drying cycle , which is an option . the batter is very good . in the month i have used it , i have charged it twice but it really did n't need it as it said the charge was good . overall ... excellent product . could there be a better shaver out there , maybe , will i ever know ... at this time , i am not worried about it , i am very satisfied with this panasonic , and do n't think it can get any better . this product does not include the cleaning base . i do recommend it as even if you do n't use it to clean the razor , you can use it to dry it , it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying . but , if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor , this is it !
1	i 've tried a lot of different `` nutrition '' and `` energy '' bars , and these are my favorites ( along with a couple of other chocolate zoneperfect bars like double chocolate and chocolate raspberry ) . great taste , a nice texture ( sort of like nestle crunch ) , and much more satisfying than candy bars . almost as tasty as girl scout `` thin mints '' , but not as fat- and guilt-inducing
0	nothing but problems with unit since i received it . either it did not work when i went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again . never had the same weight reading twice ! the only reason i rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less
0	this product does not massage at all ... ... just vibrates . i have it under my desk at work and rarely use it . very disappointing
0	enough single-use garbage diapers are used in the u.s. each year to reach to the moon and back . think about where they come from and where they go . what kind of world do you want your kids to live in ? cloth diapers are not difficult , and regardless of the propoganda of the garbage diaper companies , they have no where near the negative environmental impact .
1	this is a wonderfull massager , i have had other ones in the past and they were'nt as good as this one . for $ 50 this massager is great it really was well worth the money for what it gives out to yourself . the power on it was amazing i was really shocked i dident think it would be that much in a good way though . so i was very pleased with buying this acuvibe massager and it really does work great so i hope i helped you make your chose right
0	the batteries that come with this charger we 're not a problem for me . in fact , i was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine . i was however , disappointed in the charger . the charger requires that all four aa batteries be in the charger for it to work . you can not charge just one , two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted . also , there are a maximum of two slots for aaa batteries and when they are in use none of the other aa slots are usable . given the price of nimh batteries , the charger works out to be about $ 2 ... which is about what it 's worth at best .
0	and i am not just talking about weight loss products . i took one pill ... .one pill ! within a few minutes , i was curled up around the toilet crying because i needed to throw up so badly but i could n't . i had n't drunk anything but one glass of water with it , and yet , i was peeing all day . i was nauseus ... .my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me . i did n't want to move , but i would have to go to the bathroom to pee , and would carry around a trash can with me just in case i finally could throw up . i would not wish these symptoms on anyone , not even my worst enemy . that was probably the worst sickness i have ever had
1	we all have from time to time brought those heavy bottle of liquid detergent to the washing machine , and breaking our backs in the process . thankfully , all small mighty might be a unique solution . it is a concentrated detergent that works with the capacity of a traditional 100 ounce bottle . i like it because it really does a great job at cleaning clothes that have n't been completely spotless from all those tough messes from other methods . i really think that everyone should own this product because it saves a lot of headaches , while being true to its price . that 's all ! price : b+ convience : a- overall : b+
0	i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest . however , i was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil . i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help , but nothing seemed to work . the taste is n't bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist , so it did n't leak out or touch my gums . my teeth were n't sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards , but later in the day . if you have sensitive teeth , i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain
0	i received this as a christmas gift and thought , `` why not ... i 'll try it . '' the woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me not to apply any pressure when using the device . as a redhead , i have extremely sensitive , thin skin so i followed her advice very carefully . i did not apply any pressure what-so-ever , and did n't keep the device in one area for too long . the result ... .. worse than any sunburn i 've ever had ! my legs are burned in various areas , as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin ! the skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas . i 'm a little concerned and think i should call my physician , as the condition is extremely painful . worst of all , the hair grew back immediately the next day and i had to shave the areas that were not burned . this is a terrible , dangerous product !
0	i wanted a good reading lamp and bought this lamp after doing a bit of research . after taking the very heavy lamp out of the box and assembling it , i turned it on to find that it gives off very little light . i thought it might be something i would need to get used to and sat down that night to read only to find that my eyes were straining under the light . i tried using the lamp during the day/twilight and found that the illumination of the lamp was barely noticable . though it was quite a feat to put the lamp back into the box it was shipped in , i returned it to amazon which is something i rarely do
0	this machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet . the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions . a bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank
0	this does n't even deserve 1 star . this supposed `` relaxation '' gadget was a complete waste of time and money . it had no heat as advertised and the vibration just left my ears itching . ( ... ) instead of relaxing , it has increased my stress level 150 % ! ! ( ...
1	smells divine ! this is a powder-sweet and refreshing scent that wo n't overwhelm the senses . it 's soft and subtle , yet killer if it complements your body chemistry . i love using this particular fragrance ( especially during special occasions ) . it exudes both simplicity and sophistication -- wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy ! ! ! try it
1	after buying several different seat cushions for my office chair i found this seat and it is the best choice i ever made . the seat has a low profile but is extremely comfortable
0	this bp monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use . bp from monitor checked closely with manual bp . after the first 2 weeks , got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries . i can not rely on this monitor for my patient 's b/p results
0	these are just ok , not great . i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them . the sunglasses , however , are not as sturdy , the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just can not endorse them . i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses . it 's a shame
1	i was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before i started using this pillow . when i started sleeping on it a couple of months ago , the pain was gone after the first night , and it has n't come back since then . it supports my neck perfectly . i highly recommend
1	i love this razor ... it gives a nice close shave , is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry . nothing to complain about here
1	accurate scale - records use of two different users plus guests ( or your chlidren ! ) remembers prior info . body fat % is a great and fairly accurate feature . these combined features make it worth the cost . plan on reading the manual to set up
0	i used it one time , placed it on the charger and it never worked again . now i face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair . not happy with my internet purchase from your company .
0	i bought this product and the only thing i really gained from it was acne , plus my body actually seemed to get flabby . once i got off it the acne was gone and my torso looked nicer and more cut . would not recommend this to anyone
1	the razor and trimmer are both easy to use and give a nice clean shave . i am very happy with this item
0	these clic glasses are a great idea ... i first saw them on csi-ny , and sought them out , but they are not made big enough ... they worked fine as long as i was looking down , but as soon as i turned my head level , or looking up , the glasses would `` pop '' apart . i had purchased two pair , and returned them both
1	so far , these fit the bill . just used them for the first time -- find that they are easy to put on , and comfortable -- and better yet , do n't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain/rope/string
0	i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and does n't smell too much , however , i 've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings , and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads . i 'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin . on mornings after using this cream , i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin . there are better products out there
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price . did n't do a thing for me . wipe it on , let it haze and wipe it off . no difference .
1	my husband is in love with this razor ! he thought he was a norelco-only fan , until i bought him this model for christmas . i purchased it due to the great reviews it received , both from consumers and independent reviewers , and also b/c it cost less than $ 40 . it leaves his face so smooth , whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days . in fact , he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn . highly recommended
1	these little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums . flossing with traditional floss hurt because i always cut myself and deeply . it probably saved me from serious gum disease , and that i understand is expensive to treat , so i 'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy
0	before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say `` usa '' near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their `` lifetime guarantee , '' only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a `` handling fee '' attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .
0	it didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago , it works just as good as a regular non-teflon curling iron
0	very disappointing . the shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate . it is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it ca n't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use . predictably , when you turn on the shower , the head drops groundward , spewing water in a horizontal spray . installs easily , but save your money
1	i am a foot reflexologist and i highly recommend this product . it is very helpful in working the reflexes on the bottom of the feet
0	the item pictured here is not what you will receive . you will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design . most important is that the model you get will not have the little orange change filter indicator . this very important feature takes the guess-work out of when to change the filter . do n't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured . thanks , pj-berk
1	this the best product out there for preventing and ridding red bumps , ingrown hairs , and the other unslightly skin/hair irritations
1	purchased a case of bally energy drink since i seemed a bit sluggish after a 12 hour work day and kept making excuses not to work out . gets me up and at em ' and no more excuses for not going for a long walk or trip to the gym ! drank 1 can in the morning @ 5:30 am and another around 3pm . give it a try
0	i am a big fan of the regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs and think they are great . however , the sport goggles do not get my vote of confidence . they have three problems which make them unusable for me : 1 ) on all clic products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head . however , unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by clic , the sport googles do not adjust properly and so the goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there is also extra foam padding on the sport googles that make them very snug , but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3 ) the maker does n't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the irridium ( red ) colored lens on some of the sports goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path . sorry clic , but your success with the reading glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the sports goggles . i would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me !
1	and now a word from david lynch , as spoken by dean stockwell as doctor yueh in dune : `` the tooth . the tooooootttttttth . remember the tooth . '' seriously , my daughter loves dora the explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes . i bought this dora the explorer battery powered electric toothbrush , and she does . game . set . match . best money i ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction . when i tested this model on my finger , i was surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit . this electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull , but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing . battery life is okay , i estimate it costs about ½ a cent for her to brush her teeth each time . the future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills i 'd otherwise have , so this is a money saving unit . if your child in a member of the dora cultus , this is one of the better items to own
1	works as advertised and i am happy with it 's function . much nicer than other battery powered toothbrushes . one issue is that supposed `` quick change '' tool to remove the brush head either i ca n't figure out or it is defective , but once you put it on the brush head a pin is supposed to press into a slot to release the brush head . it never releases . is there a trick to do this ? also the instructions say put on the tool press in and then pull off the brush head . the problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in , there is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still attached . once you take the tool off the brush head will not slide out . anyone figured this out yet
1	i bought this scale for my wife ( ya , i 'm that sort of guy ) ! she 's definitely not heavy , but 'concerned ' and a follower of weight watchers . i was shocked to read various scale reviews prior to purchasing this one and find so many that did not weigh accurately ! well , this one was highly rated by most reviewers for accuracy they are right . this scale is very accurate in determing a person 's mass ( sorry , i was a physics major too ) and confirmed at her weight watchers ' weighings . as for it 's accurate determination of `` body fat '' and `` water '' , i ca n't say , but feel these are a bit gimicry anyway . as for my wife , she loves the scale me . although , her love for me covers over many poorly chosen gifts , so i 'm not absolutely sure about her love for the scale . however , i do know she uses it ever day and enjoys telling me of her victories
1	the foot massager is great . it 's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like . the massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit . the massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt , raise/lower and etc . the only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it . so keeping it upright can be a bit challenging . but for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet
1	i was n't sure what to expect when i 1st tried this two-part microdermabrasion peel kit . i use it twice a week , and what a difference it has made on my skin . the only thing is , i wish they made a bigger bottle of the peel . mariann
1	after total knee replacement , this wedge sure helped to keep my knee in one place and elevated , while preventing me from moving too much while i slept or was resting . highly recommended
1	this heating pad wraps around , stays put , does a perfect job and turns off by itself . spend the money and get a better mousetrap
1	this product does wonders . it helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week . like another customer , i have sensitive skin . i did n't feel this dried my skin out at all . but a word to the wise , make sure to read the directions carefully , this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints . if used properly , its fantastic
0	i loved ths retractable cord hair dryer when i first bought it about a year ago . now it 's starting to stop running . it appears to be a short in the power cord in the inclosed casing . when i 'm using it ... it works then it stops , then i shake it and then it starts to work again , sometimes . my last hair dryer lasted over 20 years . they just do n't make products like they use to . for this price i should n't expect much . i guess you really do get what you pay for ! this hair dryer is perfect to take on an airline . if it 's not allowed on the plane and they throw it out , ... ... who cares
0	i am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging `` palm kernel oil '' as an ingredient . do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil , cocoa butter , and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many `` organic '' things are added to it . for many years now , it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease . the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases .
0	i really like the crane humidifiers for children , my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time . it occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet . so i was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good . i was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than i had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different . still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it did n't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off . this may be a fault with the one i received and so i have sent it back , or it may be a design flaw with this shape . i have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere . so although i have n't had chance to use it i am more hopeful of success . it is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them , i forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time
0	the description says `` slipcover zips off for easy cleaning '' , but the product did not come with a slipcover . the pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern . now i have to find a slipcover that wo n't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath
0	i purchased the product . found it to be not accurate . also in order to get your ldl result you have to use 3 types of strips and a formula to calculate it - costly ! ! cumbersome ! ! ! 3 times `` niddle '' your fingers ! ! i returned the product
1	a vitamin is a vitamin but when you pay half price then you have something
0	i thought this hot air brush would make things easier by not having to hold a round brush and blow dryer . it 's a great idea , but it just does n't work as well as that . first let me say i have shoulder length , normal hair , but a lot of it . if i air dry , it is slightly wavy . i used the larger of the two brushes and found it could n't get through my hair . so then i was using a second hand to try to push the hair against the brush so it would curl around it . that did n't work very well , and i wound up burning my hands more than once . i also found that i could n't get the same nice curl with this hot air brush that i could get by using a regular round brush and dryer . the other major problem was that the brush got extremely hot . if you have an idea that you 'll be able to change from the larger brush size to smaller ( or the unit without the attachment ) or vice versa , you wo n't without getting burned . the attachment -- even the end of the blow dryer itself -- is simply too hot to touch . i was doing things like using a hand towel to try to change attachments . the size and shape of the unit is also not optimal . i found it too large and awkward to use . the off button is located right where your hand is , so it 's easy to bump . also , there 's no cold shot . if you 've come to appreciate what that can do for setting a curl , you 'll probably miss it like i did . additionally , as another person has mentioned , the unit is very loud . you would be wise to buy a couple foam ear plugs if you are determined to keep this brush and keep your hearing . i do n't believe i read any warning about the noise , either . it 's much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer . time wise , i found that i spent much longer trying to get my hair dry , and then i was n't fully satisfied with the style as well as the burns and hassle involved in getting there . i gave this a try for a few days and then returned it to the store for a refund . it made me appreciate the traditional blow dryer and round brush . some things are just not as good as they seem .
1	does everything as advertized . love the turbo feature that speeds up the heating process to less than one minute
0	the amount of time resulted in minimal results -- i was very disappointed
1	i bought this item for my husband for christmas . he has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him . we use these pillows everyday sitting up watching tv and he uses the head and knee wedges while he sleeps . the only downfall now is that he sleeps so good he snores !
1	while some of larabars have a thick grainy-nut texture , this particular product is very smooth and almost tastes like chocolate candy . for those of us who ca n't eat real candy because of allergies , this one is a winner ! it almost tastes like a soft girl scout thin mint cookie
0	i bought two boxes of these luv diapers ( thats 448 diapers ! ) and i sure wish i had spent a little extra for pampers swaddlers . these diapers leak out the top because they do n't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist . even the generic kroger diapers have elastic waistbands ! i am just sad that i have to use these crappy diapers for so long ! i also think they run small so i probably will not even use them all . what a waste ! the only good thing about these diapers is the price , but , i would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue . p.s . i do n't like huggies either because they leak out the legs ! hard to find a good diaper
0	absolutely no power whatsoever . if you have true back or shoulder pain you are better off with a hand massage or standing under the shower . no power at all in this machine .
1	this was almost too strong for me at first . i put it on the lower level of the house and it took away that `` basement '' smell for months . i was impressed with the `` throw '' this thing had . i would definitely repurchase .
0	i was hopeful that this little product would be up to the job but alas , i was wrong . it turns out this is a fragile , underpowered , ineffective tool . darn .
1	i have been very satisfied with the monitor . it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate . i was disappointed to find when i opened the box that there were no instructions included . a quick phone call had them on the way . i was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time , etc . all-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device
1	these items are neat little towelettes that come in their own attractive and useful plastic container . they are very handy , and work wonders for insuring cleanliness . personally , i sure wish i had had these when my first two children were small . on the down side , flushing these things *can* result in plumbing problems , as i experienced . apparently , if your sewer line is relatively new and clear , they should give you no problems . but , if your system has any place in it where things can collect , you will face problems . according to my plumber , toilet paper begins to break down quite quickly , but these towelettes can take over a month to do so . ( my house was built in 1916 ! ) so , overall , i do like this product , and i recommend it . i just recommend that if you live in an older house , that you do not flush them
0	i have found another product that i want to recommend . it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon , but you can also go the starlight website and order it . it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters , and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i 'm using it . they also have a product specifically for weight loss . i have tried that as well . i did feel a bit jittery at first ... but it settled after a week or so of taking it . i would recommend it also . i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs . i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss , but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings . i 'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need ... energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it . i 've used this for years and have not had any problems .
1	imagine your eyes closed , and tiny vibrating fingers massaging your head and neck . until you try this product , you ca n't truly imagine how good it feels . everyone deserves a little joy in their day , right ?
1	this is a great drink . i wanted to try something that was different , and this definately fit in . it isnt carbonated , and tastes really good . what i really wanted to know though , was how it worked . there is no caffeine or taurine , and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary . it worked well though , and i was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it
0	i was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer i was using by hot tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers . after using about 5 times it stopped working . i will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable . the temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint . i ended up purchasing another hot tools dryer , a little more money but worth the price in the long run
0	the massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone . there is only 1 heat setting , which is ok , but it 's a bit hot for only one setting . it 's like the high setting on my 3 setting hot pad
0	to get hot lather , which is nice , you first have to get the device installed on top the can . i would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated . the directions provided are sparse in several languages . first you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream . they provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others . then you have to fit the device on top the can . it worked well with one brand in a large size can . when i tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process . using a different brand in a large can , i had trouble prying the top off the can . if you have time and patience , and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well , give it a try . otherwise , be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language . it would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the us ( apparently manufactured somewhere in asia ) would provide a clear set of instuctions in english , in reasonable large readable type , with illustrations . in this case , they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for . i do not need instructions in foreign languages , and get tired of limited instructions in six languages
0	this will require a large mitten in colder weather . this does not appear to use electrical impulse . this will require more adapting to than you might think . when working , it is accurate .
1	i have received so many compliments on this fragrance . i can always pick out the scent when someone else is wearing it . although a fragrance will smell different on each person , i have not known of anyone this one did not work for . i guess the negative reviewer is the first i have heard of . i highly recommend this to anyone who likes a fresh fragrance
1	this is great-my daughter looks for reasons to use and wear the quick gems
1	i picked this up at the store a couple of months ago , and it works well . i does have a nice light scent initially , and it sooths the face . it does not have any spf though , so in summer i used a different balm . but it has been good this winter . check it out
0	pull ups are not very good for potty training , they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom . potty training does not include using diapers . that is what these are is fancy diapers . if you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them . the wetness liner is a joke . these also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants
1	at first i did n't quite get how great this shaving cream is because you have to work a little harder to get it to lather than the other shaving creams or gels i had been using . but once it breaks into a lather , it 's great . plus it lasts at least 3 times longer than regular cans of shaving cream/gel . i 'm buying this from now on
1	i 've tried several lumbar cushions from amazon and this one is the most comfortable , despite being so inexpensive . i only wish it did n't have the `` wings '' on the side
1	smaller size did not fit me or my son . it would be nice if you could use perhaps a hat size to determine right size . standard size worked fine .
1	my first aquis mitt was rectangular . i like this one better . rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand . aquis microfiber is the only fabric i use on my face . it is gentle on the skin , yet cleans more thoroughly than anything else i have used . ( i find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric ! ) if the manufacturer is listening , i would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2 . this would be perfect for bathing baby/children . there is a slit in the seam , on the thumb side , so your thumb can protrude . you can grip/lift without removing your mitts . some size choices ( s/m l/xl ) would be nice , as this mitt would not fit a large man 's han
1	this is a great iron for a starter , but will not do it like a stylist . i have had it for at least 2 years so it will last also . the price is a little bit to high i only paid $ 19.99 for it at walmart.i know everyone has gotten used to shopping online because it is eay and always open , but i have to tell you that most of the things i have found on amazon are priced way to high . they used to be a great spot to get good stuff cheap but that is no longer true . i think it just kind of creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on . please folks go back out in to the world and start looking you will see that i am not wrong
1	this small flosses is great . to get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it . the little plastic floss can break and get stuck between your teeth . happened at least couple of times so i switch to the string floss
0	i purchase this press , and was totally disappointed with this product . it takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press , than with an iron . i will be returning
0	the individual packaging is nice but the floss breaks frequently nexcessitating more than one to floss your teath . the glide products are much nicer
1	i love them ! i have a fairly expensive 6 piece lithograph and each piece is about 15 lbs . we were not only able to hang them with minimal damage to the drywall but have them almost perfectly abutting each other
0	does not maintain water temp . splashes all over at the proper water level . rollers hurt . noisy . weak vibrations . i would n't want one for $ 5
0	i bought these `` professional '' clippers only to discover they are very unprofessional ! i am very disatissfied with this product and would not reccomend it to anyone . the blades guards slip off easily and the clippers get stuck in my hair which hurts a lot . try looking for a better quality hair clipper
0	conair just really does not make great hair straighteners . i bought the full size one before , and without warning it just quit working after a 2 months . i have a revlon full-size one now ( which works great ) . i recently got my hair cut short , so i decided to go buy a cheap small one to reach the short hair in the back . turn the turbo on , blast it up to the highest temperature , and it still is not even half as hot as my revlon one thats turned on minimum . i have really thin hair , and its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes . this thing cant even straighten that much
1	i bought this product specifically because it was originally described as being/having `` mood-brightening natural spectrum light . '' i thought it would help on the gloomy pacific northwest winter days . i got it on a friday sale price , so it seemed like a good value for the product description given here . the lamp just arrived ( a few days ago - when i originally submitted this review ) , and the product 's faq sheet states this product is `` designed only to provide excellent quality light for daily tasks and hobbies . this lamp does *not* offer the correct level of light intensity specified by the national institute of mental health for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder ( s.a.d. ) . the product literature packed with the lamp has no mention at all that this product offers `` mood-brightening '' light . because of this glaring misrepresentation , i am currently debating whether to the return the lamp . i agree with the other reviewer that the adhesive labels ( there are two ) are very sticky and difficult to remove completely . i used a combination of methods to remove the adhesive residue . and i agree with the comments about the company name being printed on the front of the lamp . when i saw it in the picture , i thought it had to be some kind of company watermark or logo for the stock photo only , so i was shocked to see `` verilux '' actually printed/embossed into the lamp housing , in a very prominent location on the front of the lamp . very cheesy , for a lamp of this price point and quality . if you 're looking for a `` clean '' bright light , in a stylish , portable lamp , this is not a bad choice . but if you 're looking for a full-spectrum light that does offer some light `` therapy , '' this is probably the wrong choice . the company does have other , `` therapeutic '' lighting options , but at a higher price point . nov 1 , 2006 update - i was concerned enough about the original , misleading product description that i submitted my concerns to amazon . i now see that the description had been revised since submitting those concerns . i want to thank amazon for their very prompt response in correcting the product description , which should help other buyers make a more-informed decision .
0	i 've been kinda exclusive to remington ms3 's for a few years . they 've just been had inexpensively here and there so that 's the main reason i 've stuck it out . but in all honesty , these seem to cost me more than i 've thought in the past . like other reviews have stated , this razor takes effort to get close . hair does collect on the foils and thus as i 've noticed , causes the blades to bind on stubble . i 'm a patient person , not usually in a hurry to shave , so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning . but here 's the weakness : the foils are like paper , and flake holes in them . i just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks ( a good deal i thought for a microscreen 3 ) . my other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two ( once a hole developed , and i 'd rashed up my neck accidentally , i removed the bad foil ) . i 'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those . so i thought a new unit was the trick . well , now just three months later , the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two ( used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out ) . my bathroom is riddled with these things . my patience is now out and i 'm headed back to an old faithful : braun
1	i love this product . i have thick hair and the ceramic plates are very wide wich allow you to staighten your hair quickly . does an awesome job
1	i love these bags . they are easy to get out of the container , easy to open and close , and once the milk is in , they stand on their own . to be honest , i have n't tried other brands , so these may not be the only great ones
1	excellent product . really protects you . my dermatologist recommended this product and although it 's more expensive - it 's worth the protection for your skin . i 'm glad my children are using it
0	i purchased 2 of them , put in new alkaline batteries , and found that it will not cut hair as advertised . the motor is underpowered . useless product .
1	a lot of work when into making this cloth , excellent for cleaning lenses of all kinds : glasses , video and digital cameras , etc . if you care about your lenses health , this is the cloth to buy , congrats 3m
1	this is by far my favorite out of all the odwalla bars . i used to purchase it at trader joe 's , but they no longer carry this flavor ; so i was especially delighted when i saw it on amazon .
0	this dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could . the problem is that it just shuts off . the first time i used it , it shut off twice within a 20-minute period . it would n't restart when i plugged it back in , or even when i tried a different outlet . no matter what i tried , it would n't restart for about 5 minutes . i 've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened . i would n't recommend buying this product
1	my physician introduced me to this item . he said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods . is affordable and easy to use . oh , did i forget to mention , accurate compaired to a scale model i own . amazon is great to order from , the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days !
0	what a disappointment ! the device just was n't predictable . sometimes it would do as expected , sometimes not . it was just a crapshoot . finally unplugged it and it 's in a drawer somewhere . yes , i played with the sensitivity with no success . getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince the clapper to do its thing . save your money and look elsewhere
0	i began using gillette 's mach 3 razor when it first came on the market , and was very happy with it ( until recently ... ) the original mach 3 would give consistently good , smooth shaves , and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves . that was an excellent product . however , with the introduction of the new fusion razor , the mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves i was getting were much rougher . i had heard about the fusion and decided to try it instead , figuring may that gillette was trying to `` migrate '' its users towards the fusion by downgrading their reliable old product , putting all their new design juice behind the newer model . i was shocked by what a shoddy , difficult product the fusion razor turned out to be . i went from getting several good shaves per razor to , well ... none . i 'm lucky with the fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass , and it does n't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the mach 3 used to . what 's the deal ? did gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product ? that they 'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away , rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one ? if so , that marks a huge change in their corporate policy , from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off . i know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if gillette has decided to stop doing a good job , then forget it . so much for my customer loyalty . i 'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there 's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old mach 3
0	this product does not make you hair grow at all . im so freakin mad it is such a lie it makes your hair grow ... ... ... .im soooooooooooo madddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
0	i do n't know , but.. i could n't get myself to swallow it . it made me , literally , vomit . i wish i just ordered power bar 's vanilla-yoghurt flavored one , which tastes fantastic and i love so very much . anyway , probably it 's just me but , it really really makes me sick.. i thought i would taste something new but oh well..
1	wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially , but also in your neck and feet . your body feels so relaxed after using the theracane .
0	at first , i thought this product was great , and i used it for a few days . then , i noticed that my face was getting red and swollen . now , i look all deformed . i am really upset ! ! the acid ate away at my face and i am still waiting for my face to heal . i called neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction . march 23 , 2007 , update : after the swelling on my face went down , my whole body started itching , and i had to go see two different doctors . the internist said that it got into my system , and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system . i took the medication for over 2 weeks , and used cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching . my arms and legs are all scared . there are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed . this was the worst product that i have ever used , and i do n't even have sensitive skin . i never had a problem with a product ever ! ! i was very careful when i used rapid clear . it never got in my eyes , nose , or mouth . i used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red . i looked like the character on mask . horrifying ! ! ! i will never ever buy another dangerous product from neutrogena , again ! ! ! ! i will tell everyone what happened to me ! ! ! the funny thing is ... .. one person that i told this to , who also saw my swollen face , ... . she said this exact thing happened to her with another neutrogena product . so , i know it 's not just me ! what the heck is neutrogena putting in their products ?
1	this sunscreen has the important components to give you uva and uvb protection . it goes on smooth for a sunscreen that uses titanum dioxide for its protection agent . my kids love that the bottle turns color when uva rays touch it , indicating that sunscreen is necessary
0	does not cut hair as closely as their other model er 43
1	this creatine works very good on me building muscle , it has no flavor , i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !
0	this item is advertised as boufant and oversized . it is anything but ... . the shower cap is so tiny , it would fit on a grapefruit.this kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line
1	i was 5 minutes early getting out of the house to go to work one morning so i decided i could stop by a coffee shop and get a mocha . on my way back to my car the mocha `` splooshed '' out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all over my sweater ... naturally , that day it was a white silk knit sweater . so i had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains , and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change . the cafe was next to a supermarket so i decided to go buy a tide to go pen and give it a try . i applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the stain lightened noticeably . i was a bit worried because after treatment there were still light tan stains visible , but after blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while wearing for about half an hour , there was no hint that any mocha had ever touched my sweater . the cleansing agent also gets points for not damaging my silk sweater , despite the fact i was rubbing the product in fairly vigorously ( out of desperation ... i was going to be late for work ! ) i 'm not sure how it would work on other stains but i will keep one in my purse from now on . on the packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best on , and which it will be less effective on . from other reviews this will not work so well on some common food stains , so that 's why i 'm giving 4 stars and not 5 . another minor concern is the warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact with direct sunlight . it does n't say what will happen if you allow saturated fabric to see sunlight . perhaps there is the potential for color/fabric damage
1	i was skeptical of this product - especially at the price - however i am so pleased with its effectiveness . i rely on other reviewers remarks and so i am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price . i ca n't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple . when i think of all the money i 've spent on products over the years - and i 'm in my 40s ! i was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red , angry looking spot . this product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne . i only wish the zeno was around when i was a teenager
0	i bought this from qvc . it will do the trick for quick touch-ups - not close hair removal , but close enough . unfortunately , mine is barley operating anymore , even with a fresh battery . i 'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying . maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long . as a result , i think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well
1	i say the scale is pretty good and accurate but the fat % keep changing different % in the morning and night , like in the morning i got 30.2 % and at night it say i got 25.8 % . i dont really trust the fat % but the pound is very accurate . for the price i would rather get something cheaper
0	cheezy as cheezy can be . the only feature i liked was that this item could be returned ! the sound was terrible , not easy to tune , flimsy design and the gimmick to have it look like a bug was only cute if you are 10 years old . this thing is junk and not worth the price of the batteries it requires . mine was promptly returned
1	nv diet pills are working great for me- i lost 8lbs in a month ! ! ! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills . it is n't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and do n't work out , of course nothing is going to happen . they really do control hunger because i take 2 a day and one day i was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and i was starving looking to eat anything and everything in sight
0	this is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst i 've used . the `` cold '' function does not work well ( not significantly enough at least ) but the hot function works fine . it tends to leak the water you put in , even if you keep it below the max-fill line .
1	the shaver was very good . it gives a very close shave . not only do i shave my face but i also shave my head . it feels like i use a normal shaver after i am done . my nly advice is to empty the hair out between every shave . it seems to give a better shave this wa
0	this is the worst shaver i have ever used . it is cheaply made and completely useless . do n't waste your mone
0	i followed the directions on the package but could not get these disks to adhere to my canker sore , even one in the flattest part of my cheek . obviously , they wo n't stick to sores on the gumline or inside of lip either . cankaid and kank+a are still the non-prescription products i have found that provide relief and are much easier to apply
0	this is a cheap plastic ( except for the metal tube ) toy . it 's like those hand claws for kids . you squeeze the handle and the claw closes . the grabber part on this thing has a 2 1/2 '' opening . you wo n't be able to grab a small can of soup . the magnet is weak and is located on the outside of one of the grabber finger . on the inside of the fingers , they have rubber pads that are removable ( probably for cleaning ) but they seem to come off on their own
1	the theracane is a fantastic tool for unknotting hard-to-reach muscles . it looks clunky , but the shape is right for providing leverage ( and therefore more pressure ) to just the right spots . a great companion for the theracane is `` the trigger point therapy workbook , 2nd edition '' by clair davies . it matches sore places on the human body with the trigger points ( the muscle knots ) that cause them . i solved a persistent recurring pain in my upper back by massaging a trigger point near my throat . the unwind company is an a+ operation . ordering is easy , customer service is friendly , their prices are among the lowest , and shipping is super-speedy ( my order shipped within two hours ) . i ordered directly from their website and received free shipping .
1	excellent product , easy to mount and the clarity of the mirror is great
1	i have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down . as other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base . it makes dry shaving extremely smooth , as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess . you can use this with any type of electric , not just remingtons , and it 's very easy to clean out , just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush . highly recommende
1	as an er/trauma nurse i have seen and been involved in many , many cardiac arrests . here is some information that you need to know 1 ) you must still perform adequate cpr , if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain ! 2 ) even with trained personnel , cpr , a defibrillator and advanced cardiac life support ( medications ) the survival rate is very , very low . i am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this aed it is a wonderful unit i have been trained on it and had to use it once . i am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over $ 1000 on a defibrillator ( especially for a private home ) then a good idea would be to spend another $ 50 and take a basic cpr class . i hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it ! !
1	i found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what i want it to and i only paid $ 14.99 for it . it does n't cause my hair to frizz up and it 's easy to style when i take the rollers out . as far as it taking too long to heat up , i do n't really let that affect my review because i plug it in and while it is heating up i do my makeup or something else . ( i 'm a multi-tasker anyway ) i also do n't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair . overall i like it .
1	very handy and portable . fits my neck good and i can even walk around with it on and not worry about it falling off or moving
0	i bought this after i read the first review below ( the one who gave this 5 stars ) . it just does n't work very well ... i do a better job pumicing on my own ( it just takes more effort ) . the motor does get extremely hot , and the batteries die very quickly . the box says it can run for 45 minutes on two aa 's , but after about 5 minutes ... you can feel it slow down . definitely not worth it . i 'm calling today to return it .
1	i was unsure if this product would be as good as the one sold at brookstone . it is great ! just as good as the ijoy sold at brookstone , but much cheaper . i love it
1	this is really fun to do with a friend its so spa like i love it ! but it has so many warnings im afraid to do something wrong
1	i bought this straightner at walmart for about the same price found on amazon and i really like it . i bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does . i wanted a chi , but i could n't pass this one up for the price . i 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well . a good product for the price ! !
0	the description for this cartridge says that it `` provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria '' with its `` aquastat '' antimicrobial technology . if you read the literature that comes with it , however , it says that it prevents microbe growth *in the cartridge* . not in your humidifier . it 's not an antimicrobial cartridge ; it 's a demineralization cartridge . whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it
1	i have had this straightener for a while , and i still have no complaints about it . it is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener . i love the heat settings ... i only need to put mine on the second setting ( 338 degrees ) for it to do a good job , and i have very thick wavy/curly hair . i like the 1 '' because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair , but i 'm sure the 2 '' one is great too
0	i 'm very sorry , but the universal remote control was not what i expected.like , when i want to turn on my tv . the vcr came on and visa versa . but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.very pleased about the service , thanks.regards yoka van dijk .
1	unlike many of the other reviewers , i actually bought this shaver to use on my head . i have been shaving my head for the past 2 years and during that time have used a panasonic es8066 . it was a fine product ( able to be used either wet or dry , unlike the braun ) , but i had no idea that upgrading to the braun 8985 would make such a difference . i shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the panasonic ! no longer did i need to keep going over the same spot again and again . the braun took off the hair in one or two passes , cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation . i ca n't believe i wasted two years shaving with my old shaver ! i know panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers , and i ca n't comment on its new vortex shaver , but i know i wo n't be returning my new braun any time soon
0	i am suppose to be receiving a refund because i have done sent it back but i have not heard anything from ya 'll
0	this is the most innacurate thermometer i have ever come across . each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more . moreover , the battery only lasts for 1-2 uses . granted , one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature , but you would think the battery could last a few more times . when you have a sick child , accuracy and time are of the essence
0	there are so many different sites that all tell you that 'they ' have the best absorbed coenzyme q10 manufactured . it 's hard to know who is really telling the absolute truth or just propagandizing a product for quick sale . we are born with extremely high levels of coenzyme q10 and then it gets slowly used up as the years pass even if we actually eat the foods that resupply our bodies . and who purposefully eats these foods for the coenzyme q10 content ? the mitochondria in every single cell in our body needs this coenzyme for production of energy . by the time we are over 40 , our levels have dropped significantly and our energy levels have dropped with it . i must admit that this nature 's made product does not seem to increase my energy level like other company 's coenzyme q10 does . so , from my own reaction to this product , i do not recommend this particular coenzyme q10 . there are several other companies that make excellent , effective products ( like dr. whitaker 's and dr. sinatra 's and dr. william 's ) but not this nature made product
0	these did nothing for me . ask your doctor about aphthasol , a prescription drug approved by the fda -- which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards . aphthasol changed my life
0	first , ou can barely tell this product makes a change in humidity levels in the room . secondly , it is extremely noisy and interferes with baby monitor
1	i am a former general nutrition center employee and there are hundreds of `` powdered '' protein products that `` hype '' about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out . if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick , bloated or passing gas , then you need to trust in optimum nutritions 100 % whey protein . it truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes . i strongly recommend 2 % milk over water for even better taste , but water will still do the trick . if you buy vanilla , i suggest mixing it with berries , bananas , strawberries , or bananas for added taste . this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money
0	the concept is cute , although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them , but the main problem is that they give you hat hair , compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head . regular glasses go in between the hairs , so everything fluffs out . if you never take off your reading glasses , have a buzz cut , are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head ( but be careful of buns ) , the clic connect reader may be fine for you . otherwise , conventional glasses are a better bet
1	i have been having severe back pain ( muscular ) and subsequent headaches on a daily basis for many months . i finally brokedown and went to see one of my colleagues who is a physiatrist . he recommended the theracane to me . he is a physician who is both a dc , ( doctor of chiropractic ) and a physician , do . this physician has been doing trigger point therapy including intramuscular needling to help release the painful knots in my back . i find that i can use the theracane in between visits with noted relief . this same doctor states that this condition is like diabetes and needs to be managed for life and thus , the theracane allows for me to maintain . i think the theracane is an ingenious invention . i do n't really have anything negative to say , with the exception of the pain i am trying to manage . the product arrived quickly after i ordered it and it is exactly as described .
0	would rate at no stars if possible . first one failed after 7 months , would not hold charge . it was replaced under warranty ; the replacement failed after 8 months , again , would not hold charge . customer service said to send in for repair , no estimate of how long i 'd be without a razor . my response is `` forget it . '' braun , here i come
1	always saw them at the mall and wanted one , it was nice to be able to get it on here and not have to search , works great ! feels wonderful ! ! ! especially when you get that headache ! ! ! , also doubles as a contemporary hat ! ! haha , love it
1	got my chillow a few months ago and wish i had not waited so long ! it is great ! my own personal `` thermostat '' having gone haywire years ago , i have wished for something to help me sleep and be cool . this is it ! first , it allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him away cause he 's so darn warm and i just ca n't take the extra heat . second , i have wished for a firm pillow forever ! ! and have tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm . it can be a bit too cold for a minute or two , but it evens out before long . for those of you who have that problem , you might consider doing what i did . i purchased a `` bedsack '' quilted zippered pillow cover . put the pillow + the chillow in that and then in a pillowcase and it 's just perfect . might also help the vinyl scent that some of you complain about . i will agree that the chillow makes my pillow very heavy , but that is my only complaint . and i 'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue . other than that , i wish i had purchased one of these chillows long ago . it is a menopausal woman 's dream come true !
1	great price , good product , escellent service . i will buy from this supplier again
1	this is 100 percent plastic , makes me nervous dealing with it . the variable sprays are nice , one is so wide it shoots outside the shower . make sure you crank on this when fixing it to the water pipe . i really had to tighten it to keep it from leaking . one other reader snapped hers on the install , i was afraid the same would happen . it is a good shower head , not great
1	never owned one of these electric jobs before . could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked . hated brushing my teeth before and now i will look forward to the experience . never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point . why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean ? everyone should have one .
0	this pedometer is so much cheaper ( ~ $ 7 ) than the typical decent ones ( that go for about $ 18 - $ 20 ) .. now i know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy , the package looks very cheap , the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work , also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor . would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron/oregon sc $ 18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability and quality
1	this dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time . after initially filling the dispensers , it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button . it has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower ! it also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need
1	excellent product , good quality at a good price . i bought this whal 's trimmer to replace a whal 's trimmer that i have used for over 15 years . that alone speaks for itself
1	i am in my early 30 's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line , chin and cheeks for the past couple of years . i have tried murad , proactiv , acnefree and many other systems without success . a month ago i picked up the neutrogena system when i saw it on sale . within five days days my skin started to clear . now , i have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system . i have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before . finally , a product that works and comes at a decent price !
1	this is a pretty good flavor . it is n't my all time favorite ( apricot ) but way up there
1	out of the 3 flavors available , this one is the favorite of both my boys ( 4yrs and 7yrs ) . but no matter what flavor its a snack they both will eat and enjoy !
0	like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck ! if your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product , it is a struggle to flip the switches . i do n't know if the ionic feature did anything or not . i suppose i 'll know once i compare it to the replacement i 'm about to buy . i had the dryer for about a year ... and now it 's gone . as i was drying my hair last week i noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle ! yikes . i cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped . it lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead . no smoke , no fires , just nothing . i expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this . back to target i go..
1	these batteries are used non-stop , one set in and one on the charger . no problems would buy again !
1	i found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutique.com . the length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer . i decided to try this product to see if it worked . as hair growth is normally clocked at an 1/8 of an inch per month , i decided to monitor the results in my own little `` clinical test . '' this was actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i 'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month . i ordered a box of viviscal for which i paid $ 49 for ( average price on the web ) and the was set to take the first pill the following morning ( the box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair the night before so that in one month i 'd be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring . results : i did n't really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails were growing very fast/very long . i have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all . it was very noticeable because i use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard . never having great nails , i was pretty happy to see this . my curiosity was also getting the better of me as i could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2 weeks after coloring . i took the tape measure and measured almost 1/4 of an inch in hair growth . this would mean 1/2 inch per month and 6 inches per year . i was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small , it was twice the rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair was becoming unusually greasy . because i have very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times a week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm . well , at the 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3/4 of an inch . not only that but i was constantly trimming my nails at this point . i was totally ecstatic . but also by this point , i was washing my hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle , it was much softer , but there was no way i could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy . so - the conclusions i have reached from my test was this : 1 . yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed . 2 . viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster . 3 . viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you to have to wash it every day - and then it 's fine . it did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought a bit strange ( though good ! ! ! ) . i recommend this product
1	great product , easy to use and simple to follow instruction , keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks . i recommend it to anyone . it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do . buy it , wear it , be happy
0	i could really not tell any difference in my teeth after using this product . i could , however , see how my gums were burned by the peroxide
1	this product is totally awesome . it works great , no problems at all . since i have mostly carpteting in my apartment , i have to move it to a hard surface every time i want to use it . it zeros perfectly every time and gives me an accurate reading when compared to the doctors scale
1	i 've had this product for almost a year now . i have very thick , frizzy , hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months , and blowing drying it straight . i 've never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair . but with this one , i have not needed a blow dryer since i got it ! now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life , which i thought i would never see . of course this makes it very straight so i ca n't get any shape or curls from it ( which is what i was going for ) . cut my drying time by almost 2 hours ( as long as i apply some protective serum on when still wet ) . great product and still going strong .
0	i paid 50 bucks for a pen that is already leaking on its third day of use . the craftsmanship is shoddy . the packaging itself has nicks on it . the pen is leaking from the silver ring above the first one . i 've had to use scotch tape on it so that it does n't keep staining my fingers . the box says made in china , and well quite frankly , the product seems to be exactly that , made in china . i always thought cross was suppose to be a good brand of pens , but i now know they are n't . the problem for me is i ordered 3 of these pens and one ball point one all at the same time so i could give a few of them away as gifts . what am i going to do now ? this bites
0	dr. scholl 's pedicure essentials cracked skin repair cream had a very nice smell and felt good . however , the long-term effects were n't what i expected . i could n't tell much of a difference after using it for a week . regular lotion that i 've used in the past seemed to have the same effect . perhaps it just needed more time to work
1	i can not say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection . but it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use , so it should be at least on par with them . where this product really shines ( or does n't shine ) is for people with combination/oily skin . i have tried many sunscreens , and it 's so hard to find a sunscreen without moisturizers ( if you have oily skin , that 's already your natural moisturizers ) . i have even tried other neutrogena sunscreens that are supposed to be oil free and all that . the result on my face ? after applying it , i always shine ( which is not what i want ) . this magnificent product , however , actually gives my face a nice matte finish ... and matte feel , too ! it 's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it ( as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like lotion ) , but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin . in 30 seconds , there is no more greasy/creamy feeling , and in one minute , if you feel your skin , there 's a nice matte feel . however , and this is not the fault of the product , after about 3 hours ( at least for me ) , then i feel like the matte effect has worn off , and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature . still , as far as suncreens go , this is the best i have tried for my skin , and i highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin . btw , this review is for the actual product i got , which is spf 30 . as of the time i am writing this review , here in amazon they also offer an spf 45 version , and cheaper , too ! i do n't know the difference , but i always go for the lower one ( in this case , spf 30 ) , because i theorize -- rightly or wrongly , i do n't know -- that the lesser the spf , the lesser the strength of the ingredients , so maybe it 's better for sensitive skin ( ? )
1	well , the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great [ compared to other battery operated shavers ] . i agree . my point is that one can buy lithium batteries for about a dollar each . google for led flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap lithium batteries . some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys
0	a big disappointment.after filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the `` warmer '' as advertized.it was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.i returned it for a refund
0	i bought this item for my wife exactly four months ago ( 9-15-06 ) and she said it was working well for most of the four months . she had concerns because the electrical cord which attachs to the unit rotates and when it rotated to certain angles , the heat would turn off ( as indicated by the green light which is either off , flickers or solid ) . as she used it , the problem became more and more frequent . now , the unit will not work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle ( which i guess allows electricity to go to the unit ) . i tried taping it to that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle which is impossible to maintain when using the iron . this is not very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting and turning use and should have the highest materials and workmanship to prevent electrical . my wife admits that like anyone the unit has been dropped , but that should not cause an electrical cord problem . dropping the iron risks breaking the two flat iron ceramic plates , which are still perfectly intact . the problem is that because of the cord , and the way a flat iron is used , there is alot of cord twisting . for what is advertised as a `` professional '' device and at a cost which only a professional would normally purchase , we can not believe that this could be used in a `` professional '' environment . my wife only uses it six or seven times a week , not six or seven times a day like in a salon . we highly recommend that you stay away from this product .
1	bumble bumble products are a special `` me '' treat for pampering . the shampoo is mild and keeps my long , permed hair in great shape
1	i bought this for my mom for christmas . i have the same one . i take mine on every trip i go on . she always says she needs one . my whole life i have been a light sleeper and now i sleep through almost everything ( sometimes even my alarm )
1	i purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters . it 's a great brush head for pediatric ( and adult ) mouths . they swap out the heads , it 's rechargeable and i can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down . i have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build-up
0	i own a swiffer wet jet , and i am sorry i wasted my money . i do n't know how effective this is on other surfaces , but i use it for my brazilian chestnut hardwood floors . along with the cleaning solution that swiffer markets for hardwood . i use this product exactly as instructed and my beautiful hardwood floors costing over $ 40,000 come up with smears and smudges like you would n't believe . i realize that this is a cheap quick fix for dirty floors , but when you add in the fact that you contnually have to buy pads and cleaning solutions , it really is n't all that inexpensive the only thing this product has gong for it is it 's convienence , and technically , since i have to go over all of the floors again after using it to get rid of the smears and smudges , it really is n't that convienient either . so really this product is a big dud for hardwood floors at least .
1	useful easy to use good price i would recommend this product
1	i was searching for a two inch curling iron for a while . i have had so -so dealings with gold n hot in the past so i was a little nervous but i purchased this one anyway . so far , so good . it 's surprisingly light ( at least compared to my one inch ceramic tools curling iron ) . i usually let my hair air dry and use my curling irons to straighten my hair as i curl the ends ( i 'm black with a relaxer . ) i have yet to do it with this one . although i might try b/c it gets really hot . ( i usually have it on around 20-25 out of 30 ) the only problem is that the ceramic can chip off ( it happened with the first one i bought , but i returned it and got a new one that has n't chipped so far ) and it 's so big that if you take your thumb off the spring grip , it can be hard to get it back on ( i have huge hands too .
0	i ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price . but it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues . the pedicure set is hard to use . the bubbles are not effective.i guess cheap is expensive ! ! !
0	much too rough and dry for our baby . if you want to find good baby wipes i recommend the pampers sensitive wipes which are soft and moist .
0	the scale part works fine , but the fat % measurement does not work . if you care about fat % , i 'd recommend using the hand held device instead . it gives more accurate reads .
0	do not buy this prouct because it is made of cheap quality and the attachable plastic combs are hard to attach and break very easily . the small parts that attach the combs also snapped off without applying much force . this product looks like a good value because of the number of accessories , but they will be useless when you throwing it out within only two months as i was forced to after all of the parts broke off . save your money and avoid
0	this is no doubt the worse product i have ever purchased from amazon . i would return it or perhaps i should throw in the trash . the weight varies if you step on it within a 10 minute interval enormously . it is horrible .
1	i have not try proactive . the thought of buying something from an infomercial just does n't sit well with me . i , however , have tried many many products since my 20s till now ( i 'm 35 ) . i spent thousands of dollars on expense department store 's brands like clarins , seshiedo , dior , clinics , chanel , and prescriptives . i 've also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials , extractions , and chemical peels . i tried perscription cream , oitments , pads , you name it ( even thought of laser ) . i have mild acne problem year round , and it only gets worst during that time of the month ( that 's when i 'd run out and try new products ) . three days ago i bought the zeno . i 'm going to return it . it did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me . i also bought acnefree and today i went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag . three days now , i 've noticed my skin cleared up ! i 'm amazed . i 'm not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared . i 'll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve . so far acnefree works for me
0	this product feels like grain on the face , i do n't care for that feel . they should improve that . other wise i suppose it does the job
0	depending on how i shifted my weight -- even just slightly -- the scale read different amounts . this is normal when the difference is small . but the difference was up to 20 pounds ! there was no way to know how much i really weighed ! i called amazon right away to send it back ...
0	at first , this seems like a pretty good drink shaker . the body and lid are fairly sturdy . however , there 's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid ... and if that pops out , which it 's prone to do with mine , you 're left with a leaky ( and therefore useless ) shaker . the seal can be replaced with a bit of effort , but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle
0	this hair dryer was purchased as a christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years . i could not locate one locally so i order from amazon . the dryer only worked for a few days . nothing i do will make it work again . the reason i have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much .
0	my one star rating is for amazon 's service , not the waterpik attachment , which i never received . despite the fact that i ordered this on 20 february 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days ( and is still stated to be 7-9 days ) , two weeks later amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 april 2007 . i have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days . in my many years ordering from amazon , i have found it 's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay , as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised . i do n't understand why amazon ca n't keep better track of their inventory
0	received the item but it did n't work , nor did it have very good instructions . e-mailed company 4 times with no response .
0	do not buy this ! ! ! it does not work `` as seen on t.v . '' we were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it . would not cut a tomato , onion , carrot , apple only a cucumber . complete waste of money
1	i am very satisfied with nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo . many anti-dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough . i have thick , waist-length hair and nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage . unlike some anti-dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell , nizoral has a pleasant fragrance . i 'll definitely use this product any time i need a dandruff shampoo
1	its a freakin wet nap , what else can i say ? not much to critique here . i live in a small town their kind of hard to find so amazon to the rescue . pros : 1. style ( square ) 2. looks . it does n't shout `` hey i 'm a wet nap '' 3. shape . it stays put in my truck does n't roll around . 4. does a great job of what its intended to do , nothiing more . cons : 1 . non
1	so far this dryer is working great ! another brand did n't last 1 year so i hope this one lasts longer
0	i got the machine for my fat , muscle and water analysis as well as my weight . after 1 month of use it only shows the weight . the scale no longer works properly . it no longer shows anything else but the weight . it was a waste of money
1	this works better than any other women 's shaver i 've ever used . it does give a close shave without irritating the skin
0	worst product on the market ! a huge disappointment . i was very careful to use as directed . the result ? one big mess ! the lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and i had no choice but to throw them away
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors , i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself . i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil . if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor . the toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is delicious , does n't taste like a candy bar , and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages . luna bar toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market .
0	when i bought this , the other review was n't posted yet . now , please benefit from our two reviews . this thing is a total joke . useless , too small ( i have larger hotel samples ) . i too would like to return this , but i just do n't have time before christmas . amazon should not offer this item . it is a complete let down , over priced and just a joke . no fooling
0	wow 5 blades instead of three ? who would have thought of that ? i smell noble price here ! do n't let the great cosmetic design fool you . it turned out to be the same thing but with more blades . i was really excited waiting for my brand new fusion power razor to arrive , i am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me . after the first shave my hopes were destroyed . it turned out to be about the same thing . they even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement , when in fact , i think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face . the only obvious new feature is the trimmer , which is only that , a feature , and not a real technical advance . i hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development , instead of investing it in marketing . by the way , my power handle came broken , so i could n't test this feature , although i have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal . what will be next , let me guess , 7 blades ? i guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the `` adding more blades '' thing is getting exhausted .
1	i finally received this product in the mail after knowing about it for a year . i ca n't say i 'm a huge fan of deepak chopra . he presents some good ideas , but from what i can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a mechanism for mind and body control , leading to bliss and relaxation , rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge , to come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore . i find this bias is reflected in the game . as a game in itself , it is pretty good - its graphics and its originality - and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people . i did n't find the process as compelling as i expected , though . i found i was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast , and other places i seemed to get stuck . one potential drawback is that if you get frustrated , and try to start forcing things to happen , it can defeat the purpose of meditation . the science of biofeedback is fairly new , and i can see its potential in the field of preventative health . i just would n't put the same new age spin on things as chopra does .
1	when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him . it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings . then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out . just enough to see your baby by , but not enough to keep everyone awake . it 's been almost a year now , and i 'm just about to purchase two more . we use the light now in our toddler 's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine . we use it every night
0	please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it . i have used the panasonic es8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time i use it . stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine , it 's like french kissing jaws . the worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you , you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi.. shaving will remove . seriously , this must be one of those devices left over from the spanish inquisition .
0	hello , i recently bought this blood pressure monitor ... ..it functions all well ... ... but it gives incorrect readings ... ... .i mean the readings vary significantly ... ... ..not once , twice ... but many many times ... ... i was and am never sure about the validity of the readings ... .. purchase this at your own risk ... ..my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors ... ..atleast u will know that the readings r genuine ... and u can always find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings ... ... take care and stay healthy ... ...
1	my mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds ... birds.. ect . but all those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white noise ... and the waves inevitably break and the birds stop chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street . this is the only sound we need ! we bought it for our 3 month old daughter because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors kept waking her up . she slep great from day one ... now we use it as part of her bedtime ritual.. bath , jammies , book , sleepy machine ... and off to sleep she goes
0	we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer . it 's simply not woth anything . the little file is a good idea , but too tiny to actually work . my daughter ( 8yrs old ) liked the idea too , but was sad that she could n't work with the tiny strip that 's too short for even her little fingers . cute , but not worth it
1	over the years at various jobs , i have seen this flashlight several times . it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse . it may end up looking beat up and yucky , but they always work , no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it . if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox , work truck , pick-up glove compartment , etc. , this is the only one you need . if you need a good flashlight at home , and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store , this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy . i finally bought one just for my home , and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago ( i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox ; i refuse to replace it ) . i like this version because it has a strong magnet , and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck . i also like that it has switch guards , so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25 # of stuff in your toolbox . one nit-picky complaint . it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector . however , it comes empty and you have to supply your own , so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight .
0	this product just does n't cut my nose hair as close as the panasonic it replaced . if i could remember the model of the panasonic , i would mention it in this review . i hope i can find the manual for the panasonic so i can get another one . beware that many of the new designs are going this rout ( even panasonic ) . the manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration , but i think its more of a liability issue on their part ( someone probably got sued for a nicked nose ) . i just wo n't buy their products anymore if they 're going to design them for marginal performance
1	being sick and tired of shaving constantly and buying expensive blades , i did some research and decided to try an epilator . i figured i 'd give this model a try . i have not been disappointed ! yes , it hurt the first time i used it -- i had n't shaved in almost a week and i had a lot of thick dark hair . but , it was pulling it right out . the more you use it , the less it hurts . i have n't had ugly , rough stubble since . i also like that panasonic has included a shaver head -- this works great to trim up too-long hairs before epilation or for the more sensitive areas that are just too painful to epilate . the heads are easily interchangable and a snap to clean . this is a great all-around epilator/shaver .
0	the concept is cute , although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them , but the main problem is that they give you hat hair , compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head . regular glasses go in between the hairs , so everything fluffs out . if you never take off your reading glasses , have a buzz cut , are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head ( but be careful of buns ) , the clic connect reader may be fine for you . otherwise , conventional glasses are a better bet
0	i recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the andis company 22560 rechargeable cord/cordless hair clipper kit
0	they have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut . my hair is very short and this is unusual . if you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out . i spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better . i would have been better buying a cheap pair at walmart , which i normally do
1	i ordered one of these for my girlfriend and she loves it . friends and family have tried it and are thrilled . this product will make holiday shopping easy for several women on my list
1	i was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that . it also dried completly by the next time i needed to use it . i would recommend it to anyone looking to get out of the bathroom faster . it is not soft and cozy but it does the job
1	this is the best tasting energy bar i have ever had . my kids love them too . great high energy snack
1	that 's the only way i can rate this product . if it taste great , then it gets a high rating from me
0	within two weeks the hose connection was leaking . the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the
1	a good product , to be sure ... i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased . this `` review '' is however a cautionary : while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads , it is only rated for 18 loads . just a heads up ! [ note : i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment . thus , this `` review ''
1	it 's amazing how a little common sense can turn into a million you know what 's . as soon as i tried these i realized how much better they are than the usual throat lozenges . why ? because others cause you to suck on them , and this strains your throat muscles , which is bad . gummi lozenges , it 's genius . why did n't i think of it . then again , i did , but i did n't create airborne which is wonderful in itself . really , these lozengers are great . at night if you use one they just stay pretty much stuck to the side of your throat and you can fall asleep without even the thought that you could shallow it and choke . just remember how long it takes for a normal lozenge to disolve without bitting it ( even then ) . these go pretty quick , and without crewing ( which is the best way to use them ) . i myself try to always have them in the house . you should , and will do the same after you try them . also the price on amazon is the best . i 'm about to order 10 boxes ( would order more but for the shipping charge , which even with is still cheaper then target ) . maybe the owner should put me on the payroll .
1	fast , gentle , light , hair dryer . no frizz , quick drying results . the diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air . the dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job . the motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use . do n't waste your money on the expensive ones
0	i bought this to save time . it took me longer to stem press one shirt then ironing by conventional iron . it was too small . i end up returing it which cost me @ $ 25 in shipping cost both ways
1	i 've used this product with two of my children with out problems . i have never had a leak unlike with some of the other brands . suggestions : write the date on the bag before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use labels . also , never fill the bag ! it 's only meant to hold 6 oz . these bags are much thicker than the gerber bags and they are the only ones to have the double zipper . i used these liners with my avent disposable system and standard bottles . i 've gone through over 600 of these bags and i must say amazon has the best price around
0	did not work at all . i used cheaper products that i bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them . since princereigns promised to be a miracle product , i bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them . complete waste of money
0	took two pump bottles on a camping trip in the sierras and they leaked terrible ! fortunately i had double-bagged them in ziplock bags . i was able to spread the leakage on my body by hand , which did keep the mosquitos off for hours .
1	i was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box . the best part , naturally , is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages . i feel refreshed everytime i used it . it took awhile to get the drainage to stop , but i am glad i purchased this system . it works
0	the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these `` packaging engineers '' thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . `` press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . '' ( could they not have said , `` the hour display will blink '' ? i pressed . `` press memory button to adjust the hour . '' i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i 'd like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j r music computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i 'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j again .
1	una de las mejores compras que he hecho , es facil de manejar y deja el cabello liso y con brillo ... es fantastica
0	was very disappointed by the performance of this unit . not enough pressure . pretty useless even with new batteries
0	i tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when i could n't get a consistent reading . the temperatures were so varied it was completely useless ! ! very disappointed ! ! i returned it without even the box
1	really strong when just sprayed , but after a little while it gets soft , but at the same time not too soft . the perfume lasts for few hours , by the time i go to bed , the scent would still be there faintly , and i fall asleep to it . it is fresh and strong at first , then soft and sweet . love it
1	this is the best tasting energy bar i have ever had . my kids love them too . great high energy snack
0	this item does not work . it does absolutely nothing . i bought one and then was sent a second one . neither one works . it was a gift and i felt so bad that i gave someone a gift that did n't work
0	this thing does not stay in place . i needed a sponge to prop it up . also do n't let the chrome finish fool ya . it 's plastic all around and feels cheap . right now this is in a box going right back where it came from . no good .
1	works like a charm . it is absolutely worth the price . i would buy another in a heartbeat
0	the brababy does not function as claimed . the wholething came apart with the first wash . this device isway too flimsy
0	this water jet has a button on the handle just like the waterpic . you push it to temporarily stop the flow of water . here 's a warning : it can take a lot of finger pressure to stop the flow of water especially if you have adjusted the dial for a hard flow . if you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine . i do n't have a finger strength problem yet several times i 've squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow i had n't pushed hard enough on the stop button . i had purchased a waterpik , but had trouble with it leaking , and so purchased this conair . the waterpik is a much better quality product . the conair seems to be very cheaply made , and i am not very happy with it . i am going back to using my waterpik even though it occasionally springs a leak .
0	it lasted one year and two weeks , then the motor died . while it worked it was great . i am tempted to buy a replacement , but will probably end up trying another brand . the manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several , because when they do work they do a great job
0	i purchased this product in an attempt to help out with jet-lag and it worked really well . i 've used it a few times since and find it does n't send me to sleep any quicker than usual , but i do n't tend to wake up through the night if i 've taken it . it 's obviously not something you 'd want to rely on all the time , but very its handy as a occasional aid if you 're having a bad run of nights . does n't make you feel hung-over the next day , either . sadly , i ca n't buy any more because australia does n't recognise the product . i do n't know why , because as far as i can make out its active ingredient is good old-fashioned benadryl .
1	today is 3-19-07. this item is labeled as being purchased on 3-21-07. will i purchase another order on that date
0	unless you have the physique of an nba player find another make of massager . this one is too heavy , hard or impossible to hold , and very awkward to use . if used by one person on another it might be usable . on the positive side it does give you a good massage
0	old spice is a great-smelling cologne and i 've worn it for years . my dad wore it when i was growing up and i remember he almost always smelled of it . it 's a great cologne for lean , athletic guys who love retro ; it 's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men . it takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff . the smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention , otherwise he 'll just be annoying . old spice cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time ; exposing it to heat helps to age it ( leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building ) . trust me , it smells awesome if you let it age . i meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle . i 'm proud to say i 'm carrying on the tradition of wearing old spice cologne . it 's not nerdy and it 's not just for older men . it 's a cologne for any masculine guy . it smells great
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff . it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c. a completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product . supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices . if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster . if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond
0	i have bought this product and i have gained 5lbs . it didnt worked on me . i guess you just have to try the product . i just ordered hoodoba , on amazon and hoping that will work . hoodoba has good ratings
1	it works so great . i broke my left wrist and was in a cast for nine weeks . i will be using the stand after i can use my left wrist . it is very sturdy and adjust to different hights
0	these bars arrive smashed , melting and stale..taste like cardboard with , dried blueberrie jam spread around on them ... awfu
0	these are the bulkiest , leakiest diapers i 've ever used ! even though they do n't have bleach , there is still tons of pesticide used in cotton production - plus , these are n't even made from recycled materials
0	i thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great . i would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product . also i loved the pink . when i opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off . i tried to snap them into place but they would not stay . for the amount of money i payed i expected a much better product . needless to say i returned it the next day .
1	my bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and , being a light sleeper , i 've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber . it does n't help that my husband ( god love him ) snores as loud as a small jet plane . i 've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like i have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light . i received the tranquility zone eye mask for a birthday present and i could hardly wait to try it . i love this thing ! it 's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and , due to the design , the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears . the sounds are pleasant ( i 'm a big fan of the `` babbling brook '' track ) and i love being able to plug my mp3 player in so i can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i 've given this 5 stars because there 's no option for 4.5 . in all honesty , there are a few drawbacks . first , when i say this is thick i 'm not kidding . without my a/c in the summer it might get a bit warm . second , the sound clips themselves are on very short loops ... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you 're hearing you 'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . were it not for this i 'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you 're in a forest -- but i get distracted ( and awakened ) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades . even with these things in mind , i have to say i have n't slept this well in years . i love this thing , and i wish i 'd found it earlier . in fact , i love it so much i 've given it as a gift to two friends who 'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it , too
1	when i first tried this marshmallow vanishing crème in a sampler kit , i purchased five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this product . can i say it is addictive ? yes , i guess it does have a banana cream pie scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whip cream . to say this is decadent is an understatement . you will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream . fortunately , it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well . in fact , that is why they call it `` vanishing '' crème . the ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water , mango butter , beeswax , grapeseed oil , rosehip seed oil , vitamin e , marshmallow extract , willowbark extract , calendula flower extract , and a heady fragrance . grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins , a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble . this ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure . `` marsh mallow '' is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows . it has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine . the leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin . in the past , people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy . i found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind . not only will you feel comforted by nature , your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing . the silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal . if you love this product , you might want to try the pore-refining mask , evening primrose overnight crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick . to take luxury to the next level , try the shea butter decollete crème on your feet , hands or all over your entire body . what an amazing line of products . they heal , protect and soothe your mind . i 'm still trying all the burt 's bees products , and love how these products make me feel . they add a level of protection to your skin care routine and the clay mask i recently tried cleaned my pores like a dream . ~therebeccareview.co
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch , however , it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate . the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack . i had intended to use it as a cold mask only .
0	the bed lift system is ok if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read . however , i did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you were n't centered in the bed
1	great aerobic exerciser for the money and very lightweight . let cool down after using as metal does get a bit hot . the plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit , yet the plastic will off-gas . works best on couch while watching tv/movies . for anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out , i highly recommend this to help get you back into shape
0	i purchased the waterpik na-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment , expecting it to work with the waterpik professional ultra dental water jet , since that is what was advertised . they do n't fit in this model , so do n't waste your time purchasing both together ! the sinus attachments are too short , so they ca n't `` click '' into the water pik . the end result : water leaks out , and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment . i had to return both items since the amazon rep could n't find any sinus attachment to work in the waterpik ultra model . it 's a shame because i love the small footprint of the waterpik ultra , and it comes with a lot of cool attachments . hopefully waterpik will come up with something in the near future
0	we bought this at suggestion of our dentist . however , it is difficult to use , extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press . we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience . our neighbors bought the same model , tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave . save your money and go back to flossing !
1	this curling iron works well . it heats quickly and i 'm very satisfied
1	i love the taste of these little chocolates . i find that i need to have one 1 hour before eating - less and they do n't work . if i have two in one day ( late morning , mid-afternoon ) the effect is cumalative . i can eat a very light dinner and be completely satisfied
0	i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years . this new model er430k is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement . it 's nice and quiet , and i 'm sure the vacuum works great , but i would n't know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim . we 're talking about hairs easily 1/4 '' in length . a trimmer should be able to shave those down , do n't you think ? if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors . do n't bother even trying this product , it 's a waste of money
0	the light was very good , the magnifier ( very tiny ) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses . but the worst part were the tweezers in themselves . they were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle . also , i am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair . these did not . so they do not tweeze well at all . was n't worth all the bother of a return . i just threw it away . it was a good idea for a product , just poorly made .
0	i bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair , when it gets hot it would stop . good thing i did n't throw it away . this cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months . it is also very loud ! almost hurt my ears to use i
0	i originally planned to purchase locin floss to replace the dentek , but i 'm not too pleased with it so far . pluses ======= -each individually wrapped floss . -does n't contain floride . minuses ======= -flimpsy handle -- almost not usable . -wrap is not 100 % sealed . -flossing head is shallower and narrower than the dentek
1	i was having a problem with over-eating and eating when i was n't hungry and as a result , gained quite a bit of weight , and felt awful . i 've only been using this product for three days , but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up . i have n't felt jittery or shaky . i feel better than i have in months . i would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un-needed weight
1	finally , a product that does as it promises . excellent sun burn protection -- even in hawaii
0	upon purchasing this product , i 'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product i normally purchase at the salon . i was horribly disappointed . it was nothing at all like the typical product , rather much more like water . the normal scent was not present , the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long . i would very much like to return this . it 's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon . i was sorely disappointed
1	very happy with this purchase . received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [ ... ] credit card . it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors . i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also , the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
0	i purchased these but had to return them . while the molded strap is adjustable , it only opens up approx . 1 '' . the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5 '' or larger around - at the eyebrows , forget it , these will not fit you
0	original purchase had two dead batteries , then a replacement set had the same results , it 's as if they were bundling two dead batteries with every order . but the bottom line says it all in fine print on the back down low `` made in china '' .
1	this is the best shaver i have found during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving
1	i use these almost every morning . they 're hot and ready to go in seconds . i like the nonslip surface of the curlers . makes it so easy to set my hair , remove , and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style . i like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick , long hair . these rollers rock
1	shaving cream in a tube is just about impossible to buy at retail outlets . this is a great product and i will continue to buy it through amazon
1	i received one of these towels as a gift several years ago . it was , by far , one of the best gifts i have ever received ! it soaks all of the water out of your hair and leaves it perfect for blow drying . for women , this is a five star gift
0	i love these bars , they are high in protien , and are good supplements , how ever the 3 boxes i got were all expired . beware of sale items on bars like this
1	also bought as a gift but i tried it ! very relaxing and much more affordable than the ones you see in the mall
1	initially the sensation made me giggle . after a couple uses i got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly . my teeth feel cleaner , mouth fresher , and i 'm hopeful that i will no longer get the `` floss '' lecture from my dental team . now that 's something to smile about !
0	this product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle , need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results . hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use
1	this razor is the best i have ever shaved with . it copes with every length of hair and angle of growth whether i shave every day , every other day , or even every third day . perfect
0	ok folks , this is a relatively low quality starter kit from a really decent company . the art of shaving products in general are really nice , albeit a tad pricey . this small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving products that work nicely together . the full sized items will cost you about $ 75 - $ 100 total . the included brush is a `` toss away '' quality brush . this is not just my opinion , but a quote from the manager at an art of shaving store . my advice is to get some samples from a department store , then purchase the art of shaving shave cream ( wow ! a great product ) here on amazon , plus either the tweezerman badger brush for $ 15 or a best badger brush from crabtree evelyn for $ 35 .
1	this was a gift . it came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at . so we were happy
0	first of all , the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not . when i bought a 9 volt battery and installed it , it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment . finally , i got a read out , and entered my height and age . then i stood on the scale and got nothing - no weight , no body fat , nothing , but the word error , at which point i boxed it up and sent it back for a refund
0	does not measure up to the shihatsu 110 ac messager , which actually works . this unit has multiple vibrating buzzers . i could not feel the heat . the motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids ' giant bass speakers
0	this unit has all marketing features , date , time , memory stores up to 48 prior readings by date time , but there is one problem its not acurate . my doctor said wrist cuffs can be -10 % off just because of taking the reading at the wrist and not on the arm next to the heart , just like taking your bp on the right arm . the further from you heart the lower your readings . example : the doctor takes my bp then i take it with the cuff monitor he/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min . we tried it several times and each time it was incorrect . so he told me not to use it . i bought a simular unit , no date , time on the screen , but stores 99 prior readings , tested again with the doctor 's nurse and found it to be within limits . she said you never get the same reading twice in a row . some nurses doctor 's even take three readings and take the average .
1	i just bought this iron and i could n't be happier . it 's the perfect size and weight . the plates are n't unmanageably large , or pitifully small ... it heats up incredibly fast -- we 're talking in less than 60 seconds . i have short-ish , wavy and coarse hair- it 's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes . hai is a brand used in many salons and it 's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons . if you bought this same iron at a salon , you could easily pay upwards of $ 150 in canada ... so i consider this price an awesome deal
1	loving this air purifier ! this was really the first one i have own so i ca n't compare it to any others . it is very quite , and takes alot of dust out of the air . the first time i had to replace the filter i was shocked by how much dust i could of been breathing in . worth picking up , just wish it would of had an energy star label .
0	it 's kind of bulky for a diaper bag , which is why i got it . the clippers are not good quality . the thermometer is cheap . it has a little `` f '' for fahrenheit that blinks until it is done reading . the `` f '' is very little and hard to see when trying to hold a squirming 5-week old . it also takes a while to read
0	the price is too high , considering the ijoy 550 model is only us $ 599.99 at sharper image
1	the best price around for this type massager . price was my main reason for the purchase . mine does heat up , but the massager does have to be running for a few minutes before you notice it . the programmable feature is nice as well as the many variable speeds . i would highly recommend it .
1	i 'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard . i 'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i have to carefully prep for shaving . after years of trial and error , i 've finally settled on a good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser for a base , then kiss my face moisture shave as a supplement . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i use a product like clean dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver . with the gillette fusion power , i 've finally found the right one . i 've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first gulf war ( i was in the marines at the time ) . they 've gotten the job done , but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type . it does n't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck , especially since i take forever to change blades . i dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots ( not to mention getting blood stains on my collar ) . electric shavers do n't work for me either - too hard on my skin , and i 'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it a shot . i was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers . but the fusion power is the happy exception . at first i struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end . but once i mastered that maneuver and got the battery in , i was set . it takes one aaa-battery that seems to last a decent interval ( the low-battery indicator is a nice touch ) . and even if the fusion power runs out of juice , you can still shave with it . the shaver glides over my face , and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning . the five blades really nail my beard , and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free . i also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue is the expense of the blades . but i can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave . and most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i do , it 's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , the result is worth the higher price . the gillette fusion power is the best shaver i 've ever tried . highly recommended
1	bought it works really good , such a fun thing to have laying around , and was very pleased well worth the $ 50 it costed me at brookstone
1	i 've been wearing glasses for almost 25 years now . its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that does n't either streak or damage the lenses -- especially with ar and other coatings they put on glasses these days . the sharper image eyeglass cleaner does the trick . it also , by design , cleans your frames which is a plus . i would have given 4.5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply . its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses . i have two pair ( regular and sunglasses ) so no real fault there . i recommend getting a 3m microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied
1	clean , fresh , subtle scent ; not at all flowery , musky , or heavy ; just a clean , fresh , beautiful scent ; have n't found anything better , and the price is nice , too
0	i bought this from amazon and i do n't like it - the masured temperature drifts from 96.8f to 99.6f in 6 minutes . so inaccurate
0	i 've used ghds and even though they 're pricier they are worth every penny . after using the hai stick just one time , i had terrible split ends , and the stick did not 'glide ' over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear . terrible ! i think i 'll upgrade
1	my youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis . i bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust , mold , pollen , ect . she has been using this product for three ( 3 ) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time . we have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product . highly recommeded
1	i have pergo and can not get it too wet or the floor will bubble . the swiffer wet cloths are the perfect solution . they 're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you 're done . i hate that i 'm consuming a product that is so disposable , but at the same time , it works so well
1	i have over 60 mens fragrances that range from $ 50.00 to $ 320.00 and found that i get more compliments when i wear this fragrance than any other fragrance that i wear as well as having an risque appealing bottle . great must-have for any man
1	very convenient to use . however , since the neck band is rigid and does not fold , it is difficult to carry
0	i am a huge fan of olay products and use their foaming face wash , moisturizers ( including the regenerist continuous night recovery is a great product ) ... so i was really dissapointed to spend $ 16+ on this product and then see no change . i am in my 30 's , have fair/medium shade combination skin . i tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing . i tried using it a couple of times a day , at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while i slept ( not blending it into my skin ) . i tried it for several weeks . no results . this product did nothing for me . i would not recommend it . i would have given it zero start , but amazon does not allow it . avon has a product out that touts similar claims to olay 's product . i have not tried it yet but would suggest you see if you can try a sample of that from an avon rep. instead .
0	did n't last that long when use on a digital camera ! !
0	when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs . but after reading other review i realize the scale is off up to 9 lbs . also this is a big scale . too big to store in the bathroo
0	after using this product for about a month and a half , i began to get very high blood pressure readings ( 157/106 ) . my doctor took my bp on the same day and got 130/80 , which i also got with my manual cuff . i find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well . the only good thing about it is that you do n't have to record your readings manually . if they calibrate the machine properly , it would be a great thing , but i wasted my money
0	have had this less than two months and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times a week on slightly spritzed hair to tame the frizz . the thing died ! ! did work great while it lasted ... . now trying a conair , so keeping my fingers crossed
1	my husband and i have one drink of nature 's plus every morning and sometimes at lunch or for dinner . we started out with vanilla . i add a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- 1 cup 1 % milk and you 're hooked ! the ice cubes make it like a real shake . i have a vita mix and that realy makes it blend well . i blend for 30 seconds . my husband uses the vanilla with 1 cup of 1 % milk - 4 tbs of ovaltine - a handful of oatmeal- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- blend for 30 seconds and i do n't have to cook ! i like the strawberry . i take a cup of milk ( 1 % ) - 6 frozen strawberries- a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots - and 4 ice cubes . havenly and very satisfying and losing weight to boot !
0	well i ordered this iron and recieved a different one ! so how can i rate it ... ... .mad at amazo
0	product does n't really do anything more than blow air . it does n't appear to do anything with the ultraviolet light
1	exactly what i wanted ... works perfectly ... the flosser at the bottom the head of the toothbrush is great at getting between the teeth . charges quickly and is convien
0	when i got this pedometer , i found that the instructions were n't clear . i never did get the thing to work . i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate . this one was n't . the pedometer does n't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost . it 's just easier to buy a new one . however , i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store
1	i knew a man who once wore this classic cologne , and always smelled so good . i bought it for my hubby this christmas and instantly remembered why i loved that smell so much . it is a classic frangrance , not stinky or overpowering - but fresh . there are other vetiver cologne 's out there , but they smell nothing like the guerlain from france . it 's a gorgeous smell , and i guarantee you would love it if you are looking to smell great without it being overpowering . it 's smooth and mellow , fresh
1	i bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product . she personally like the product and really good
0	mercury contamination is a very big deal especially if you are going to take a product `` for life '' , are pregnant or a child . many fish oil products have mercury contamination and are not filtered . is this product mercury free ? ? so far the only product that was certified mercury free was available from my medical doctor by a prescription .
0	i really like my electric toothbrush from oralb so i thought i would like this too . however , it just does n't work . the cartridges they have set up do n't work because as soon as you tug on them at all , the floss becomes loose and therefore wo n't vibrate - it only vibrates if it 's taut . but because of the way they have the cartridges set up , there is no way to make it taut again . it would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed , but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges . this would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges , but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use . so ... forget it
0	stay away from this seller `` salter '' . i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away , after waiting for almost a month
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff . it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c. a completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product . supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices . if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster . if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond
1	wow ! i 'm really impressed ! i 've had trouble cleaning under my bridge . i can fish floss under there and clean it good , but it takes a lot of time . now i just blast it clean in minutes . it does a good job of cleaning my back teeth . i 've never been totally satisfied with just flossing . now they feel perfectly clean . i love this device ! it does n't replace flossing . it does a great job under the gums , but i still feel cleaner after flossing . it 's great as a between brushing `` touchup '' . i recommend it to anyone . my mouth has n't felt this clean in years . i feel like i 've come from the dentist after a cleaning . thats a great feeling to have every day
1	we keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed . it takes a 30 minute cycle , and you just put things in and walk away . it has n't damaged anything vs. sanitizing in the washing machine - and i do n't have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers . we 've even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes , etc . to periodically clean them . i think it 's great
1	this is exactly what i needed for my macbook computer . it 's comfortable and keeps my laptop from sliding around . great
0	health-o-meter 's proprietary random number generator in a cheap plastic case . step on/off this scale in rapid succession and you might get the same number twice . come back 2 minutes later and you 'll be lucky if you 're within 2-3 pounds of the first number . absolute junk
1	i have tried lots of protein powders . i get online the low-carb , low-calorie protein powders as i am just trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can stomach . i was stuck on champions whey ( chocolate ) for the past year as the best but i just got my shipment of the gold standard - cookies cream and it is amazing ! i love this stuff . i tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous . i am going to have this before and after my daily workout , but best yet , rather than binging on any ice cream desires late at night , i am going to get a scoop of fat free frozen vanilla yogurt , put a scoop of this in with some fat free milk and i have my fat free protein shake
1	at church today i came upon a man who had partially collapsed . since i 'm a physician , i stopped and offered aid . it turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms . to my dismay , we do not have an aed at our church ( yet ) . we notified 911 , and he was taken for medical care without any problems , but i was a bit worried there for a few minutes . while i 'm trained in bls , that is , at best , a temporizing measure . aeds have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms . in my opinion , places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices . i 'll be working with our church to see if we can get one . i would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for ems if i had had one of these today . however , buying an aed is not a cure-all . i have been trained on these , and they are very simple to learn to use . however , i think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest . if you are considering buying an aed for home or public use , i strongly suggest reading the section on aeds at the american heart association website . it discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device . so , while not for everyone , this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives . in the right situation , it is indispensable .
0	this is n't what i thought it would be . the instructions are unclear , so i had to refer to the box to guess at how to install it . i finally figured it out after about 10 minutes of fiddling with it . you have push down on the top to get more than a tiny bit of gel out - so it takes two hands . that means that once you put gel on your face , you get gel on the machine . i set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel warm . this must be a safety thing , but i ca n't imagine what the lower settings are for . the gel cools extremely fast , so by the time you apply it to your face , only the gel where you first apply it feels warm . i had the same machine for foam and that worked a lot better , but i do n't use foam shaving creme anymore . once i use up this can of gel , the hot gel machine gets retired .
0	sold as `` one size fits all '' but they did n't fit 2 out of 3 people in my house . they are tight even on a medium woman 's hand so beware
0	i had this model , or at least it looked the same , for a few years and it worked exceptionally well . it finally broke down recently and i thought i was lucky enough to find it again , but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all . actually , it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done , which , of course is like not having it done at all
1	i love all the varieties of chocolate , and if you mix them in a blender , they are smooth and creamy . you can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes , and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake . shaking by hand or using a hand-held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice . these are a great meal replacement - healthy , nutritious , and full of quality protein .
0	i am a 20 year user of several remington products , but i must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver . the remington es-1000 utra smooth bump control shaver was designed to replace the original ( bms ) black man 's shaver which was discountinued several years ago . i recently purchased and used the es-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance . the es-1000 performed so poorly that i had to use my bms that i had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the es-1000 shaver could not and did not remove . the product should be called `` ultra poor with a sandpaper finish . '' the product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet . for anyone with curly hair problems , you may want to consider comparing this product against the wahl 5-star series , model # 8061 . i think you will find there is a major difference in the products
0	while i am not sure what exactly these do taste like , i do n't detect the peanut butter here . the texture is good , chewy enough , but the taste is ... odd . not at all sweet . i ca n't imagine any child ( or adult ) grown accustomed to high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these . bleh . if you want peanut butter , the clif bar has a much better flavor ( and an even denser , chewier texture ) . if you want a z-bar , i slightly recommend the chocolate -- although it too tastes a bit odd and is inferior to the chocolate clif bars . builder bars are also worth a try , sufficiently sweet and flavorful . of course , with these alternative product lines you will get about twice the calories . although i will not buy these again , i give the company a star for a worthy effort
0	this shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower , but that 's about it . the shave is n't very close , and it takes a long time to shave . to do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor
1	we use the zbars for breakfast , and my kids love them ! i love them too , as they 're organic , contain no trans fat , no refinded sugar or flour . they 're yummy and healthy
1	for me a good tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer . i had the same one , this brand , for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment . i immediately ordered my new tweezer . if not dropped i suspect this would last a lifetime
1	i bought this model 7 years ago for over $ 100 and it is still running strong although i only use it to clip a small family dog . nevertheless , forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor ' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal . this clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action . in fact , with the right ( replaceable ) blade , you could use this to cut kids hair as well . it stays cool , unlike the magnetic motor design . use with oster kool lube and you will never have problems getting a clean cut . it uses blades by oster so there is a lot of versatility possible
1	i have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries ( 6 two-packs ) and i must say that they work exactly how i projected them to . they hold a charge well enough for my uses in various electronics and my infant 's papasan swing . regular duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days . these batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines ' life and i have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss . i am very pleased so far with my purchase . get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size d become easily available and cheaper
0	expensive ... and after three months of daily use i ca n't say it has helped my blood pressure . i record my blood pressure every morning at the same time ... after getting up from nights sleep . i use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises . then breakfast and 15 minutes on resperate devise . my blood pressure has n't changed significently in the last six months and i continue to take blood pressure medicine . the resperate device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule has n't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent . i continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but would n't consider buying it again
0	two main problems with this `` cordless massager '' . the first being that it does n't hold a charge for very long . you may get an hour use on a full charge , and that shows diminishing power as it goes . add to that it 's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment . if you 're looking for something to rumble a slight bit , this is for you . otherwise , save your money
1	i 've used the pigeon brand ( i believe it 's from japan ) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality bags i 've ever used . unfortunately , they 're also very difficult to find . these lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1/3 of pigeon 's price . not bad at all ! my baby and i travel a lot so i bring along my stock of bmilk in these lansinoh bags . no mishaps thus far . highly recommended
0	not really an improvement over standard mach 3 cartridges , and certainly not worth the price jump . the shave quality still does not match that by an `` old-fashioned '' safety razor
0	this device worked about 80 % of the time on myself and only about 10 % of the time on my father . unfortunately , it was a christmas gift for him and not for me . we ended up getting a self inflating one at circuit city that seems to be working just fine . it is possible that the problem lies with him - possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at cc worked just fine
1	i love this item . i received it as a gift and now use it every single day . my hair dries so much faster after having been wrapped up in this . that 's great b/c now i do not have to blow dry as much , so my hair seems to be getting a lot healthier . only complaint would be that it does not stay wrapped very well . not sure if it 's the material or the size , but nonetheless , it still works great .
1	i am so happy with this product . i have chronic stomach trouble and this enzyme product has saved me from many days and nights of upset stomach . if i eat too late at night or eat the `` wrong '' thing , i just pop a couple capsules and no problems for the night
1	this is the best ! ! ! drys you off fast , and drys fast too.. so soft and comfy on my skin ! !
1	this an excellent tool to self massage yourself . it is very steady and very controllable . you can really reach in with it . i tried different canes and this is the best one . buy it for yourself and your friends and they will love it ! do n't forget to buy the instructional dvd . it is really helpful in learning the proper way to use it
0	i bought this product from the discovery channel store and i really want to love it , but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after i bought it . i returned to the store where i was given a new fountain , but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later . the mister still works well , but the led lights are unpredictable at best
1	i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator , well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way . it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it . it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good . and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so .
1	a very gentle undereye cream . i have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time . this one is definitely a keeper
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase , so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled . when i read `` chocolate pecan pie '' .. i expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate , with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base . what i received was a bar with little taste , nothing at all similar to the name on the bar . in my opinion , the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it ... the flavor is barely there . the bar is dry . it is never again be on my `` purchase '' list
1	clic eyewear is a thoroughly convenient way to wear reading glasses . i keep them with me hung around my neck all the time . the glasses are made well . almost every person who sees me click them together wants to know where i got them
0	this remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me . i used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor . ouch . however , the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor . the design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils . i have owned norelco and braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave
1	i purchased this unit for my personal office at work . its small and unobtrusive enough so as not to necessarily stand out . its runs quietly and well , operating on the highest setting for several hours
0	... and it was n't worth having to send it back . seriously . i thought maybe it was the batteries , so i switched them . no luck . it ran very , very slow , and then it just quit . as another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use , it 's my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism . i will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time i was able to use it , so i 'll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash . i have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it , so i know all their merchandise is n't shoddy . maybe i got a dud , considering many others ' positive reviews . i sure hope so
1	i 'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews . one reviewer claimed that soldier fuel contains no energy ingredients . this is untrue . soldier fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops . carbohydrates are the body 's primary source of energy . soldier fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs ( the carbs that give long-lasting energy ) and 12 g of sugar . the u.s. military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash . most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine . since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy , the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash . another error is that soldier fuel has more sugar . it has less . one 12 oz . can of soldier fuel has 12 g of sugar . the same amount of gatorade contains 21 g of sugar . the same amount of red bull has 39g sugar . finally , the support for the troops is not marketing hype . our company is partnered with the u.s. military 's natick soldier center . a portion of the gross proceeds from each can of hooah ! soldier fuel and each hooah ! bar directly funds research that improves the safety , diet , and quality of life of our troops
1	there are several listings for this item in different versions . before making a decision , check out the other versions , you will see many different reviews . overall , it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended , it works ! you can see my full review under zeno pro pink
0	i found this product after seeing it lauded on the today show and it appeared to be a great idea . however , i had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the brababy and they were pretty tangled when i later took the bras out . i also have to wonder how a larger bra would work , considering i 'm merely a b cup and it was a tight fit . in theory , i think it 's an excellent idea . in truth , i think it still needs work . additionally , although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer , one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times i 've used them - even drying on gentle cycle . it did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus . i hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue
0	warning : this system could be harmful to your health and happiness and walls . 1 . ) the danged clippy thingy is very difficult to snap on to the hot , damp , roller , so it is very easy to burn fingers while trying to manipulate it . 2 . ) this is very frustrating , and made this reviewer want to throw roller and clippy thingy at the wall . 3 . ) the sadistic designer only made one way for the you-can't-put-a-square-peg-in-a-round-hole variously sized rollers to be replaced in the unit after use . this puzzle remains unsolved by this reviewer . 4 . ) this is very frustrating , and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged unit , rollers and clippy thingies included , at the wall . 5 . ) even if you only use a few of the rollers on your hair , you have to take them all out of the unit - ( the better to play the afore-mentioned puzzle game , my dear ) to dump the unused water out of the unit prior to storage . 6 . ) this is very frustrating , and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged water-filled unit , rollers and clippy thingies included , at the wall . /tundravision , amazon reviewer
0	i bought this a few months ago , and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly . it yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them , which is very painful ! it does n't pull them all the way out , which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue . sometimes it works okay , but what good is a razor that only works half the time ? others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it 's losing power . mine does sound `` slower '' when it 's yanking the hair , but that does n't seem to be related to battery charge ( e.g . it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode , and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in ! ) even when not pulling hair , the shave is not close . definitely find a different razor
1	this is a great fiber supplement ! ! when you chew it , it starts out kind of crunchy but quickly turns chewy kind of like a chewy sweet-tart . i usually keep a glass of water by even thou it says you do n't need water . they have a good flavor and yes i do use it as a substitute for candy every once in a while . just remember too much of a good thing will give you gas : - ) so do n't be in a small elevator .
0	i thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where i do n't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth . but contrary to what 's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses , which ended up dirtier than they started . the wipes work okay on a computer screen , though
0	i could n't send this item back quickly enough . i presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers , that it would be an effective , high quality item . never presume ! with a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle , it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably . i 'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet . i 'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers i 've read seem to have . this is just an unusable product . the materials look cheaper in person , it offers virtually no `` massage '' to the foot , and it is incredibly loud . there is no redeeming quality to this item . before i bought it , i looked all over the web for a review , unable to find one . hopefully i can save someone else the disappointment . did i mention i hated it
1	i used this while breastfeeding my son ... and while i only had one issue of chapping , it was a lifesaver . i loved it then and have used it on several other things since..great on chapped hands , lips etc . but i do n't know what i would have done without this wonder creme . and it 's an essential baby gift that i tend to give at showers !
1	i purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers . we are all on our feet all day long . after one other coworker told us about the one he had , we all had to have one to help our tired feet . everyone of us is very happy with this product . it is a great value for the price . there are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super . we did have a problem with one , but amazon quickly exchanged it for us . i think it was defective from the factory . great product and even better service from amazon
0	this product is not even directionally accurate . it said that my body fat percentage was 10 % higher than actual . then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25 % body fat . perhaps we had a lemon , but i am taking this back because it is very inaccurate . in fact , this is the first review i have ever written because i want to warn people about this product . please do not waste your money
0	this was a piece of junk . neither my husband nor i could ever get it set correctly -- we wound up throwing it away , going to target and buying one of their 10,000-steps pedometer . that works great
0	like many other negative reviews , i 've experienced the same problems with this razor . i guess less blades is more and i 'm going back to the m3 power . i 'll be brief about the problems : 1. there 's more `` pulling '' when you shave . it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut . 2. the razor is harder to clean off . 3. i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn . 4. it 's more expensive than other better razors out there . so there you have it . if you have to try it out , hey it might work for you . but please , keep your receipt ( and packaging ) in case you want to get a refund . * * if you 're reading this is 2009 , chances are that gillette 's money back guarantee will no longer be around . however , there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then
0	if you 're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes , this thing works acceptably well , but if you 're mixing something like `` ionic fizz '' magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit , it 's not very useful because it just does n't form a very good seal , no matter how tightly you close it . as another reviewer mentioned , it 's very easy to cross-thread the lid . thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help . it is great for sipping though , and easy enough to keep clean . but i went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it . the seal on this bottle is too flaky because it 's difficult to tell if you 've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it . i 'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has . i do n't use this any more , because it 's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading . do n't waste your money on it .
0	i can not address the value of buying products from this manufacturer ; that 's for you to decide . however , this product performs noticably worse than its earth-unfriendly alternatives . clothes come out greyish and stains are not as well removed as with tide , the other one i use . but the decision is yours
1	finally tried this , and i definitely recommend it . it doesnt have a strong smell , very pleasant and neutral . it feels so good on your skin after you shave , very soothing and moisturizing . try some , you 'll love it
0	in two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds . do n't waste your money . the 11 $ sunbeam dial scale is more accurate
0	i purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem . big mistake ! it simply will not stay put no matter what chair i tried it with . the arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much , it has you bending over backwards . i believe it actually made my back ache more .
0	got the bodybare and the ladyfair combo . the ladyfair is cheap and poorly made . it pulls as much hair as it cuts , plus it cuts the skin.the bodybare does nothing at all . it 's so weak and delicate that it wo n't cut anything . do n't waste your money..
0	if you want my review in a nutshell , here it is : two defective rise shine lamps . one call to verilux . verilux refuses to help . if you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass , read on . my verilux product experience : i exchanged my first verilux rise and shine natural alarm clock bedside lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker , ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping ( if i am to understand the verilux ' company president 's response to a similar defect report in these reviews ) . the good news : the speaker in the second unit now works . and contrary to some of the other reviewers i feel the mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice ( with a line-in jack for cd player or ipod ) . the bad : despite the jumbo lcd display that might lead you to assume that the am/fm tuner is digital , the radio is completely analog . the station ids are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead -- small enough that some owners will need their glasses and a magnifying glass to select a radio station . by contrast , i own an alarm clock by conair with a similar analog tuner , with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point lcd digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit lcd display . on verilux ' comparatively enormous lcd , i am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option . an analog tuner without a station display is something i expect from a $ 15 drugstore alarm clock , but not from a product of this type , which is otherwise very well thought out . unfortunately , due to an apparent flaw in the shade and/or the lamp itself , the shade on my replacement lamp -- the lamp i received from the store in exchange -- wo n't sit straight ! one can remove the shade , look at the lamp on a level surface , and see the lamp `` shelf '' slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted ! making the situation worse , the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered . there are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down ( as typical of most lampshades ) . the ring , in turn , sits on the lamp body ( or shelf ) . the whole assembly is cockeyed , including the socket into which the bulb sets ( at a very obvious angle ) ! cosmetically speaking , there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type . whereas the first lamp i purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the lcd panel , the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf , and it , too , must have been obtained in manufacturing . as for the shade itself , it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish , roughly 3/4 '' , that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen . so while the second lamp did not have a doa speaker , i apparently traded one problem in for another . worse , the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room ( and would probably appear that way from down the street if i were to set it on the curb ) . in short , the verilux rise shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price/warranty suggests . and in case you are wondering if this might have been `` gray market '' merchandise , it was n't . i purchased my rise shine lamp straight out of a high-end , authorized retail store , new-in-box . the am/fm clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light , finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5 '' wide at the base and 20 '' tall -- makes for an outstanding combination and concept . for this reason , i hope verilux will continue to refine the rise and shine model , particularly where quality control is concerned . given that i am a gadget fan , and someone who has rated products 1/5th the price of this lamp very highly , it should be understood that i really wanted to give this a positive review . but two duds in a row ? irony the rise shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer . given that my replacement lamp is also defective , i followed these instructions . but in reality , verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers ' problem , not theirs ( as per the instruction i received to make a third 40-mile trip back to the store where i purchased it ) . conclusion ? verilux does n't back their warranty ( in my experience/opinion ) . nor , apparently , does verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers . so if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong , consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience . and believe me , there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of verilux ' customer service department , either . what verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the internet . as it so happens , i supplement my income writing product reviews for websites . in fact , i am a writer by training/trade . translation : verilux chose the wrong customer to let down . i have no intention of smearing verilux ' reputation -- unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such . would i recommend this product to a friend ? yesterday i might have said yes , chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke . today , coupled with the fact that verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy , my answer is a resounding no . should anyone at verilux read my review , i wish to close with this thought : i could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems i noted , but a ~ $ 5 lampshade , to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box -- and does n't sit straight , to boot -- is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy ?
1	i have used this supplement for more than five years at the suggestion of a herbalist . i have never felt better . not only does it seem to help keep those colds away , it seems to keep me more health feeling and less tired
0	i bought a pack of 3 and used twice daily in the shower to try and clear my oily skin problems . this product left my skin dry and sometimes peeling . did not work for me , but it might work for you
0	i wish i 'd listened to the other reviews . i bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me . claims a five year warranty but i ca n't return it to amazon so it 's just money wasted . be smarter than me , avoid this product if you value your money
0	although it kept time ( which indicates the batteries were good ) this did n't work the first day i used it . it worked the second day . it stopped working by the third day and the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost . this was a complete waste of $ 19
1	it is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer . it does its job pretty nicely . the dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world . a little big for travelling , but compromises with its folding handle and light weight . the disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage . it is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment
1	i ordered this parfum because it is really cheap . i received it 4 days after ordering , delivered very fast . the flavor is very nice , make me feel comfortable
0	the best kind of electric toothbrush ( according to my hygienist ) is one with a rotating top to the head , that way it gets the gums better . i ordered this one and i do n't like it ... besides the lack of rotating head , it is very loud and i feel like i 'm going to wake up my roommates . : )
1	i have been using this for my face for over 10 years . it is very inexpensive ( especially compared to other cosmetic brands ) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin . i also used it on my 3 kids . it comes in handy on the changing table , especially when the wipes were not quite `` wet '' enough to do the job ! it is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing . it can just be wiped off without leaving any residue . it is very gentle , even for newborn 's skin
1	i recieved my product in a reasonable amount of time and i am happy with the product .
1	this product does make the appetite disappear ! ! however it made me very irritable while i took it . i took it for four days so i did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked . the pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation . everyone is affected differently when taking things so i would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away .
1	i was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but i am so glad i did . this one gives me a really good shave . i have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since . another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud , which it is but since you turn it on and leave it , i just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem .
0	i purchased this prior to surgery thinking it would be great for recovery . however , the `` nature sounds '' only worked the first time i turned it on . after that , despite changing batteries , etc. , the sounds never came back again . i would n't recommend this purchase
0	this item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks i bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and i only wear it 4-6 hours a night . this product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so . i like the design and it does n't cut up my mouth but i ca n't be replacing it every other month
1	great tasting bar . nice and soft make it easy to eat
1	i have nothing bad to say . it gets hot enough . it was cheap . it seems well made . the cover is washable . it 's just what i was looking for
1	i decided to buy this product before i read the reviews . in my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind . there is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place . the first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard . i havent had the problem since . i noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days . my gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly . the pick color returned within an hour . it really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem . all in all if you are looking for a product that works , this is a good one . i was truly surprised at how well they worked . i will be purchasing these in the future
1	this shaver has met all my expectations . it cleans and recharges itself automatically . the shave is close and nick free . the only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes
0	i have heard fabulous things about gripe water from fellow mothers , but this particular brand is horrible . the scent is strong , and the taste is strong and medicinal . there are other gripe water brands out there that do not have such scent/taste . upon ingesting only 1 ml of this gripe water , my 7 week old daughter gagged repeatedly and vomited . up until then , she never vomited before . if you want to try gripe water , find another brand
0	i bought this from ioniczone themselves . it does not work . i kept it on for an entire month , the filter was never dirty at all . also , this unit is extremely small , the pic is rather misleading i was however able to return the unit to the office in nv , had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite . i went on to buy one from ionicpro , and what a difference it was , filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty .
0	i suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review ( which i saw in the description of the product ) was amazon 's idea since most ( if not all ) of the label information is easily found on nature made 's own website www.naturemade.com . there you will find that several of the components are synthetic ( not necessarily bad , but i like to know ) , and also that amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product . ai n't it just amazing what the web can teach you ? thanks amazon ! : )
0	while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products , this conditioner ( and i might add shampoo by the same name ) was a real disappointment . using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent . do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one . i 'm saving my $ $ $ $ $ for lush and frederic fekkai
0	the razor is n't bad , but the cleaning system is a joke . mine would n't release the razor kept recleaning it . plus , and i am surprised that this is n't mentioned in the other reviews that i read before getting the razor , the cleaning solution ( which is an expensive , printer-ink type of gimmick ) stinks like metal solvent . bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price
0	received the item but it did n't work , nor did it have very good instructions . e-mailed company 4 times with no response .
1	i have several of these glasses now . love them . they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck . i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one . good price and good product .
1	this is the only energy bar that i have sampled more than once ! the hooah ! energy bar works faster , lasts longer , and tastes better ! ... both flavors ! ... go army !
0	does not cut hair cleanly . ends up pulling at hair and requires multiple passes
1	this was bought as a gift for my dad , who has limited mobility . it 's easy for him to use , easy to handle and gives him a great shave . he really likes it
1	for many years i could n't use a electric shaver because it was always a incomplete shave , so after each christmas when i received a new one i would try it and would go back to a manual razor , then came along the freeglider and yippy it did a reasonable job that i would call satisfactory , the over the years that razor went obsolete so i started to look for a new replacement . i read some of the reviews . i read `` the refills are costly ... hello ... 4 $ a month ? , then i read does n't do a good job , well let me report to you all this is the best darn razor , its like magic each time i use it ( cleans itself each time '' its quick , comfortable , quiet , the cleaning process is so cool and i for one love the concept of a clean razor each time i use it , this razor is 10 times better then the freeglider which i loved , what a joy shaving now is , i can even shave twice ( i go to work sometimes at 3am then later that night if i 'm going out i can shave again and it does n't irritate.. what a magical razor they have designed .. ps . the cleaning solution is not expensive ( under 12 $ for 3ea , that 's 4 $ apiece and lasts a month ) . thank you to the designer i highly recommend this 2 thumbs up cons none i can see as yet .. john
1	i love these little bibs . i say little , because even though they are the size of regular cloth bibs , the big size bibsters , which i also bought , are huge , and cover my 9mo . old baby to almost past his diapers . i was reluctant to buy bibsters at first , because they seemed such a waste of material being disposable- and i guess they are -- however , they serve a good purpose in that they are extremely light and thin and fully waterproof , so that my super-drooler does n't get his outfits totally wet like he does with his cloth bibs , which i 'm frequently switching out . bibsters are also very easy to pack into the diaper bag , and i 'm never without a bib . i 've also been using the big size bibsters on my 2yr old in the car , for random snack spills . these are not really reusable , but i sometimes do use them for 2 meals , depending on how clean they are . the price was right when amazon grocery had the spend 50 get 10 dea
1	i purchased this dryer for my wife . it took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with 1600 to 1850 watts power setting . my wife 's hair is thick and long , so she did n't want get anything below 2000 watts . this one is light , powerfull and handy . i strongly recommend it
0	i have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends , a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week . a neighbour suggested the mr clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she did n't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub . i am disappointed with it . the one thing i did like was the pole . i was able to scrub the tub , the tile on the walls without needing to overreach . that said , i really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub , and still could n't get it all until i used my regular scrub brush . i think i was expecting this to be a way that i could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so . the other thing that bothered me was that you have to rinse off the stuff after you scrub ; from watching the commercial i feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you 're done . at least it was n't that spendy so i do n't feel too bad about the wasted money
1	upon recommendation from other consumers , i purchased these rollers . i travel a great deal for my job and get-aways with my husband . the rollers heat up well and are compact . i just keep them in my suitcase all the time so i 'm ready to go
0	i saw a review that made it seem like these were indistructable . not so ! they tear easily . better than just empty wal mart bags though , but not by much
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money . the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars , is that i think the one i bought for my mom ( same brand and model ) is slightly more accurate . a great way to track your fitness overall
1	compared to the olive aloe bar , this one seems to lather better
0	like the fading in of light . would like the sound effects ... if they worked ! out of box the sound effects did not work . now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace . such a hassle
1	this is a good medium priced shaver . it does a good job , is fast , and easy to clean . it is attractive , and fits the hand well . not top of the line , but a good value . nothing negative to report .
1	i 've only had this scale for a short time , but so far so good . i 've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money . as someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often . i specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason , with an inexpensive digital scale , which is what i had last , you ca n't reset it like you can an analog . this scale is a great buy , for only $ 10 how can you go wrong !
1	this has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use . it really does n't start until your arm is in the correct position , letting you know by beeping when you 've got it right . the display is large and easy to read and understand . i definitely would recommend this
1	i have n't used it thoroughly yet . but from what i have seen so far , it is a pretty good scale to track your everyday fat loss progress . i am satisfied with this purchase for the price and quality and ease of use . i use it daily to track my body fat % and weight . so far used it for only myself . have n't checked it out for more than 1 users
1	although the compartments seem small , you can fit lots of food into this bowl . it 's divided into about 4 or 5 sections , so you can separate your veggies , meat , etc . the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break : ( so , i use it to store food in the fridge . i have all of the other fit fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken .
1	this is a great sized foot bath . i pour hot water in it , sit back and relax . it does n't keep the water warm , but if i start off with really hot water it stays warm until i 'm ready to get out . using the pedicure attachements is hard work though- i just assume use a hand-held brush . the bubble feature is too loud to use while watching tv . still , for the price , i like this foot bath . i 've even given it as a gift
1	i 've used creatine as a strength aid to supplement my lifting for years . this is the real stuff at the best price i 've ever seen .
1	i like this cutter . i can use it by itself or with its accessaries . even when the batteries are low i can still nip those little overnight hairs . works for me !
0	i am an african american woman with long , chemically relaxed hair . as a full-time undergraduate student , i can not afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis . i purchased this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat iron had recently shorted out ( it was an older model with no swivel cord ) . i chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one , and i was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance . i can not say the same for this product . in retrospect , it does exactly what it claims to do , but nothing beyond that . with my previous flat iron , i could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time , which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure . any attempts to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least . after using the flat iron , my hair looked fizzy and unkempt , and even a bit damaged . any curls i managed to produce looked undefined and limp . it was by chance that i purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron , and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum . needless to say , you wo n't be able to produce that `` fresh from the salon '' look with this flat iron , which is sadly exactly what i needed . i do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product . if you do n't use this tool for anything but sleek , straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy , then this is a great product for you . while i am not happy with its results , it will have to do for now . i 'll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening and curling my hair does n't leave it severely damaged .
1	$ 10 bucks and does the job . you do need to adjust it every once in awhile but that 's easy to do .
0	frankly suggest not to buy..will regret a lot after buying.. ooooo ... aaaa ... ..ouchhhh ... ..tooo painful and hair starts growing in a weeek ... and taking very loooooooooooooong timeee to finish one hand.. **************************dont buy********************
0	all this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing . i looked at it for a long time , i never found a clear explanation of what it actually is . so i tried it and it seems like it should cost about $ 11.99 . save your money
1	( ... . ) . it takes some getting used to , but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave . i got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks , but i think i was pressing too hard like i had to with my old razor . just a light touch gives a close shave . the attachable sideburn trimmer does n't do a very good job in my opinion , but i kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose . the gel packs go pretty quickly , but maybe i 'm using too much . i 'm still trying to get the hang of it . it 's a different experience than your basic razor
1	i have to write a review for the below review ( the one i have in quotes ) . the below reviewer states this is 170 watts and you need 1875 watts . i nearly fell off my seat ! not only by the review but by how many people recommended it ! first , 100 watts is average for a hair straighter . 170 watts is excellent ! 1875 would melt your hair ! i did not think it was fair that this person rated the item without having knowledge on wattage . `` this straightener only has 170 watts of heating power . that is not a very good number ! if you want salon-straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts ... especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair !
0	i 'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so i do n't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable . either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer . i follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before i get a consistent reading . i threw mine away
1	this is the second aquis microfiber body towel i have purchased . the waffle weave makes a huge difference . i had a plain microfiber towel and it just did n't feel like a towel . the aquis towel has a real towel feel , dries me off great and then dries out quickly . i keep it in my gym locker and it 's dry the next time i need it . in the summer , i use it after swimming in the morning and it 's dry by the time i teach swimming in the afternoon . and it does n't take up much room in my locker or gym bag . it would be great where i used to spend my summers in michigan where it was tough to dry out the beach towels .
0	sorry sleepmd - we are not impressed . not only did sleepmd not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too . today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off . no - i did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed . more like we were run over during the night . i wanted to inquire to the company in person - but ca n't find a website to do so . so i plan to write . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it 's a waste of money
1	it is working well , little slow warm up . but actually i wanted a hot air brush , not this , because i have very short hair , but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush
0	was initially impressed with the backrest ; however , because the straps are not adjustable , it dose n't stay in place . the one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place
1	i get compliments all the time on this scent . it is one of my favorites . it smells exactly like cotton candy . its fun , flirty , and nostalgic of childhood romps at the fair ! if you like sweet edible scents , then this one is for you
0	i purchased this for my mother . she states that it runs too fast and it is painful . i tried it myself , and it hurts just like she says . not recommended
1	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids ... kids will be kids ... but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push . easy to mount and easy to use
1	has all of the features that i wanted ; digital readout , body fat monitor . relatively easy to set up
1	i have had this model for years ! and i cut my hair with it 3-4 times a month between me my sons . it is the best clipper set i have ever owned . most clippers i buy only last 1-2 years . i have had this one i think 5-6 years ! well worth the money
0	this pad barely got warm . it 's going back ! since this is the same complaint as with another sunbeam model i tried , i suspect it is n't defective but intentional ... probably for legal reasons . but should n't a heating pad actually have some heat to it ? ?
0	it dose good for the bikini area . however you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly . it did not work on legs at all . it would pull a few hairs but broke the rest . with out the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin . the tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs . razor attachment dose not work to my satisfaction .
1	upgraded to this razor after my old remington died , and i 've been very happy with it . it cut a bit close , which irritated my skin at first , but i think that was just me getting used to the `` lift cut . '' this would be an excellent razor if it was n't for two features ( or lack thereof ) that make it a pain to use . 1 . the internal battery is nicd . this type of battery has `` memory '' to it , which means for optimal performance , the battery should be fully drained before you recharge it . otherwise , the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless . 2 . there is n't a low battery indicator . by itself , either of these features would n't pose a problem . combined , you 're left wondering when you 'll have to charge the shaver , or when you 're off on that business trip , if you 'll need to bring the charger . in the long run , this razor is cheap enough and i expect the battery to last for years . still , it would have been better if the battery was made of nimh or some technology that 's not 15 years old .
0	i bought this and it worked fine the first time that i used it . granted , it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom . however , i have tried it in my infant 's room 4 times this winter . i used hot water salt to try to help it , but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam . maybe all of the `` steam '' energy is being used on the night light ! if you have your home 's thermostat set under 78 degrees , do not waste your money on this item ! find something stronger to get you through the winter months
1	i bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower/tub combo . he loves it . esp . the height adjustment feature
1	i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer , i found it easy to use and accurate ; however , after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor , and that was it , it no longer works ... i will probably buy another one , but it needs to be treated with kid-gloves .
1	as a reviewer of the hitachi magic wand , i can say that this accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the job , the plus is that this can be used with or without the power cord . perhaps just not as powerfull as the hatachi but pretty dam comparable if not the same , the cordless battery operation is worth the trade off . as mentioned it does the job
0	i was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning cds , yet i was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched . as for scratches , you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you . the solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches . i tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same . multiple applications fared no better . the disc i bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when i started
0	the idea was great and i did enjoy the warm lotion , however i used it three times and put it back in the box . the on/off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time i turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out . would love to recommend it but i just ca n't . i use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up
0	i bought this item and had it shipped to a friend out of state . it never worked . she replaced the batteries when it arrived , but that did n't help . it was a complete waste of time and money
0	had this for less than a month and it just stopped heating ... ..the only reason i gave it one star is because of the size and when it did heat it was nice ... ..but for the dozen times used it was not worth buying ... will be returning it
0	it made my skin very dry and break out because of it . my floormate had the same reaction . we were both very disappointed . i recommend going for vitaclear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than proactiv although it is a little more expensive than this .
1	my husband is very pleased with his `` self-cleaning '' razor , although he did n't like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs . it 's an excellant appliance
1	these are the best diapers i have used . they are soft , flexible , and easily adjustable for a good secure fit . they hold leaks extremely well . of course leaks do occur ( why would n't they if your baby has , say for example , 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes ... .it 's happened ) , however this is to be expected . they do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy , but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection . i highly recommend these
1	dr. riter 's real-ease is a simple , gentle , and healing neck support . it is effective , easy to use , and affordable . it helped healing post accident , and with general body pain healing and relaxation
0	i bought this monitor because it was affordable and i thought it would be an easier and faster way to check my bp regularly . it is easy to use , but i got much different readings than the readings i got from my arm cuff , the dr and several other sources . i returned it and will stick with what works for me
0	the first time i tried to use this tool the spring came off and would not reattach . the screw holding the spring on was defective . what a dissappointment ! !
0	broke after two uses , buttons are hard to switch , and drying time was not better than my old-school model . in fact , my hair was frizzier . i was kinda glad it broke . i wish i had read the reviews before i bought this
1	this product works great , they recharge fast , are just warm to the touch not hot , and have extremely long battery life . battery charger works great and has nice car charger adapter
1	the mirror is great . i use it for shaving my face and it fits the bill perfectly . both the normal and 5x mirrors are nice and clear
0	i ordered the ergo lounger . when i arrived , i was shocked to find that i could barely lift the box that it came in . i wanted to move it to another room to unpack . this was supposed to be lightweight `` aluminum '' but the box clearly said `` steel . '' i did not want one that would rust because i intended to carry it to the beach to use it . i actually called the manufacturer ( they provided a toll free number ) several times . never did they answer the phone , nor did they ever return any of my calls . so i could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not . the lounger itself seemed pretty nice , just too heavy and probably would rust soon
0	i know everyone else has had good luck with this , but not me . the unit started running really slow after about a minute . it also seems to scrape my face . another nit pick is that the adjustable spacer does not have any marks or numbers on it , so you do n't know what setting you 're on
1	this contains 16 servings , which means it will last you half a month . that 's pretty expensive when you break the price down by serving and whne compared with a 1 month supply of the flax capsules that costs $ 7 . however , liquid flax oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the store . a flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg of flaxseed oil and a suggested dosage of 2-3 times a day . so with pills you 're getting 2-3g of flax oil a day . with liquid flax oil , you 're getting 14g of flax . if you are buying this for it 's purported treatment of acne , sunburn , diverticular disorders , hemorrhoids , and more serious health conerns , it 's probably best to consume the liquid flax oil . if you just want the benefits of lower cholesterol and heart disease prevention , a pill a few times a day , combined with fish oil should be all you need . it 's definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the morning than 3 flax pills a day , and when you loook at value , you 're getting 224g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with a typical 100g in a 100 pill bottle of the capsules . it all depends on what you need it for
1	excellent product my hair was striaght and dry in a matter of minutes
1	i find this product to be very good for calfs one of the best foot massagers i 've ever tried . the one drawback is that it tends to slide away from you when you are using it on your feet . i would reccommend it
1	great product for the $ i spent . i picked it b/c i can replace the batteries myself and the cost was in my budget . it does jump around more than i 'd like , but i can tell from the range that i am over or under my target heart rate . it does beep to let you know that , but i find it annoying so i turn it off . if you find you have trouble getting it to register your rate , then move it around a bit . mine works best when i put it higher on my chest , in the area of my heart , just below my shoulder blade .
1	i have owned many beard trimmers , but this is by far the best .
1	i bought this for my father-in-law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old . my mother-in-law at sixty seven , does n't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and can not wield a full-size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry . the light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments . i would n't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however . it 's not as easy to use as a full-size standard wheelchair . this is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage
1	i was reluctant to buy this after reading that it was n't so great on fine hair , but my son 's hair was really getting shaggy and i was *not* going to wrestle with him at the barber shop again . so i bought this and was so happy when it worked perfectly on his hair . i used the 1 inch guide for his whole head and he looks great ! the vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing , because i cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house . he did n't have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape , which he hates . having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer -- what it sounds like , and feel like -- in his own time and environment . he cut his stuffed bear 's hair first , then daddy 's , then his own by himself and then let me cut his . what a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming . at $ 25 , it has already paid for itself . i 'm so glad i bought it . i did n't give it 5 stars , because it is pretty loud and had a really crappy users manual .
0	i bought this product in rite aid . unfortunately , it irriates my face . they are scamming people just to buy this product . instead of repairing my face , this product damage my face . there are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since i start using this . now , i need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product . if i knew this will happen , i will not waste my money to buy this product .
1	amazon still has n't quite figured out how to ship these ... mine arrived with one case broken open , although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag
1	this simple scale is light , easy to carry and store . i tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale . it read the same weight , but actually with less flucuation when i shifted on it . i was careful to keep it on a flat surface ... i had good luck on old hardwood floors , less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom . it was very consistent on a level surface ... i tested it several times in a row with the same reading , and various times throughout the day ... nothing read unusually . i really like the form factor of this scale . it 's so small ... not small spacewise , but just thin , light , with a nice solid place to plant your feet
0	these glasses were a bit of a disappointment . the convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment . and actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use . great idea but maybe some `` fine tuning '' would help ... like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck .
0	hello , ( i trully hope you do n't lose your money , because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with high hopes ) . = ( trust me , this does n't work , i sadly bought both of them body bare and ladyfair . i spent over $ 300.00 including s/h and boy was i dissapointed . i would like to say , that if you would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver you should think about it , i would like to tell you so that no one else is fooled by the looks or sites . i also bought everything with it ! i got the entire combo and more . since i wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks ! ! ! ! 2 weeks ! none stop to make sure i bought the right product . body bare or ladyfair are the same . these trimmers do n't do anything , sadly a normal shaver is better than this . plus it leaves bumps and rashes ! ! ! !
0	i explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate , but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand . my hands are still buzzing from the night before when i used this product . i would not recommend this product to anyone else , i loved the crystals cream .
0	the best thing i can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results . the actual results varied greatly from those i received from my doctor 3 months prior : ( ... ) both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast . all instructions were followed . i find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months . i contacted biosafe customer service . all representatives were busy on my first call so i left a message , which was not returned . i called again and was able to speak to someone right away . the customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods ( finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm ) will vary `` slightly '' . ( ... ) i question the accuracy of the biosafe results .
1	what i wanted for christmas was something to turn my bath tub into a whirlpool , and my boyfriend bought this for me . the bubbles are no doubt amazing , they 're plenty strong even at the lowest setting . as for the massage part , i did n't use that too much- it just vibrates some , and the bubbles seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager . the only thing i did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult to keep on the tub floor . it has suction cups , but they did n't work too well- everytime i moved my feet or legs , it wanted to float to the top of the water . overall , i 'd say this is a pretty good gift ! i will definitely use it many more times
0	ewww ewww get it off get it off ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! omigod i loved hugo so much i 've been anticipating this in the mail and bought the shower gel from a different source as well . this is just terrible . i 'm taking a shower . look for my posting of this cheap ... i 've already taken a loss . i have reviewed many colognes , take a look at them . i like most of them
1	... i purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely . the microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady , but soft and textured . using it was easy , i just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone . ( some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but was n't ) the packaging is a little subpar though . it comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out . however doing so leaves adhesive residue , which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off , making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed up i 'd say . this is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination , so i used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off . i 've yet to machine wash it , but so far it works well . it 's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure . we 're yet to verify what the culprit is ... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch . i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor . it 's been consistant , reliable , and informative for both myself and my doctor
1	if you have trouble sleeping ... this mask is for you ! ! for anyone struggling to get even a few minutes worth of sleep ... you will not be disappointed ! ! fabulous ! whether for a nap or for getting through the night - this mask will definitely help ! i have given several as gifts and everyone is in agreement with me ! the only negative is - the company changed from an endless sound model to 30 minutes of sound ... therefore - i wake up and have to re-hit the sound selection ... but , i 'm still getting more sleep than i have in years and years !
0	i think the shaver works well , but the plastic is thin and cheap . the biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor , cleaning brush and charger . i think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case
0	this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet , so i bought this specifically for that use . i used the triangular pumice attachment only.i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate , but in general it 's just a vibrating ( 2 levels ) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually . the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference . the actual machine has no function . the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine
0	this product does not do what it advertises . does not work at all on my facial hai
0	i bought this product after having taken diet fuel w/ ephedra several years ago . i needed energy this time and to lose a few extra baby pounds . within minutes of taking my first and only pill i had a horrible reaction . i broke out in welts within 10 minutes all over my body . i was shaky and sick to my stomach . i drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and finally started to feel better . i thought i was going to die . my only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again . after about 2 hours the welts disappeared but i felt horrible for the rest of the day . obviously there is something in it that does n't get along with my body but after that reaction i had i have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you .
1	this makeup covers my rosea and a birthmark . its light and lasts all day . i put it on with a brush . and i love how i do n't feel or look like i have makeup on at all . love the case and the mirror..thanks ! jud
1	i installed this unit in my basement about 6 months ago , and it has been working flawlessly ever since . things i noticed : if the power goes out , the unit will not turn back on automatically ( as some other units do . ) if you want to use the continuous drainage ( which i highly recommend ) via a hose , you have to punch out a plastic disc on the side of the unit . i would have designed a screw-type plug that was replacable , but they did n't think of that . anyway , once you punch the quarter-size disc out it 's out forever . if you choose to use the continuous drainage feature , you will need to pick up a hose with an inner diameter of 15mm ( .59 '' or just over half an inch . ) i went to the local diy center and found some clear tubing that has worked well . the unit can operate down to 2-degrees c ( 36-degrees f ) , which will be great for continuous operation in the garage to keep the tools from rusting . has three fan settings : med , high and quiet . `` quiet '' really is quiet , and could probably work just fine in a bedroom . though , it does warm the room it 's in . how much it warms it depends on the humidity setting . four settings : the humidty level ( humidstat ) can be set to `` continuous dehumidification '' ( which is the default setting ) , 50 % , 60 % and 70 % . the fan will continue to run but the dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the selected humidity level . cool . i mean , that 's when the fan will just blow room-temp air . a full drainage tank will stop the unit and illuminate a `` tank full '' indicator light . the unit is not that heavy -- maybe for some , but not nearly as heavy as some people make it sound . it 's 30.8 pounds . according to the instructions : you will need at least 21 cm ( about 8 inches ) of clearance in front , behind and side to side . air blows out of the top of the unit , so you 'll need to make sure it 's clear as well . there are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight up , 45-degrees or almost straight ahead . power consumption : cfm-25e is 220w // cfm-40e is 330w i highly recommend this model dehumidifier
0	i 've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned . i have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week . the length adjuster on the side of the clippers does n't hold . if the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down . tightening the screw did n't help either . the attachments do n't fit right , especially the blend attachment . this attachment can only be used if you do n't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull . the only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck
0	i purchased these as a christmas gift for my daughter . they take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair . for the money i do n't think they were worth it
0	razor works great but it 's easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle does n't get all the hair out
0	i 'd give this machine 5 stars if # 1 ) it was n't so expensive and # 2 ) , it was n't so darn small . it barely fits anything inside . it works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two , but that 's about it . anything else just wo n't fit . and the design of the inside , with the piece in the middle , makes it even more restricting . in my personal opinion , this product is not worth the money . i am so disappointed , because it sounded so perfect . but , its just not
0	i tried this product because i had been using arthred-g powder which was discontinued . this product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that i could not finish drinking it . it tasted and smelled rather like soap . if you used arthred-g you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage . there is no comparison here ! ! ! i would totally avoid this product
0	this glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse . since one still has full function of his/her hands when using this , you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing . when using these gloves , your hands and wrist will feel better at first , but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse
1	these batteries work well . they do n't last as long as normal batteries , but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs . if you have kids with toys , these are a must
0	this review covers the fb11nr : same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an ir remote . somehow , i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered . nope ... basically just built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one 's foot upon . that 's fine , yet when i want to relax , i 'm not thinking about moving my feet . fortunately , those are removable , and removal is exactly what happened . the killer was that the center massage wheel , which is supposed to be powered and is supposed to spin , was d.o.a . this unit went back to the store , and we bought an fb21 instead . amazon has no listing for that model , so i ca n't give a full review on it . it was good enough to keep . both the fb11nr and the fb21 share some traits . neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature . sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud , depending upon the operating mode chosen ( i did db measurements on the fb21 , but since amazon does n't list that one , you do n't get to see them ) . the fb21 seems to have slightly better build quality , and everything worked out of the box , so we kept that one
1	i 've had my son in huggies brand since he was born . i started out with newborns and just went up in size . i loved them and they never sagged ( unless they were really full ) . i loved the trim look to them . when i had to get pampers brand because the store was out , the pampers brand always looked like he had a full sagging load . even if i had just put them on and they were dry ! when my son was 1 , he decided to take off the `` tape '' on the daipers and he just would not keep it on . so i switched him to pull ups . he kept those on and has been in pull ups for 3 years . sometimes they did leak at night , because he went too much , but if i changed him once a night he was fine . now that he 's older , i do n't have to change him , because he does n't go at night . these are really best out there , and they do n't look like they are always sagging like other diapers
1	i was all set to do the typical 10 day antibiotic course for a sinus infection ( i even had bought the antibiotics ) , but decided to try this first . it is very effective in clearing the sinuses , nose , throat and lungs . couple things : 1 . it makes a minor mention of using a solution ( if desired ) in the tank provided . i used vicks . it more than doubles the steam output . so even if you do n't get a solution , use plain water . without it , the output is not impressive . 2 . if you do get vicks , get your magnifying glass out and read the dilution instructions . they do not make it clear without reading the fine print that it is a highly concentrated solution . if you add it undiluted , i think you 'll go blind ... i highly recommend this unit
1	this is such a great product for nursing moms . it is not bulky and is reliable to keep leaks from happening . for a mom , this was a lifesaver for me to allow me to go outside without being embarassed by having a wet shirt
1	i bought this bag for my husband as a surprise ( as i had bought another brand , and he did not like the asian floral print ) . it 's very roomy , looks great , fits ergonomically . i really love the pocket design and the space that they have , as well as the interior design . fits things better than my own bag ! my husband loves it and ca n't wait to use it ! plus that , this is the best price i 've seen online , and of course , amazon ships quickly and accurately
0	looked like a good product with a good price . unit failed to turn on or ever take a charge despite plugging in properly and trying to charge overnight as suggested in the instructions . now i have to go and deal with returning it to amazon , shipping it back , getting another one , etc . am willing to change my review upon receipt/use of a new unit but definitely not giving a five since now i have to go through this trouble
0	sturdy enough for the price , but no power . replaced original battery with a new duracell . still fuctioned like the battery was drained . like i mentioned before , what do you expect for the price
1	we originally got this to replace the `` fan noise '' in the winter due to our sons ' room being so cold . the first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it . we 've discovered it 's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night . with the adjustability dials it 's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who can not sleep without a fan . it does n't however , cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly . would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise , especially for children
0	please careful about this grooming kit . i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work . this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not . this lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair . also this can not be used for continuous use , if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge
1	i really liked the outside design of the book . a lot of books were `` cartoonish '' and really was drawn to the look of the book . i wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages . i had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child . but all in all i am pleased with it . i would most likely buy again
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses . the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them . he gets lots of comments about how neat they are
0	all sleep md is , is melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in . you can get melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost . melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid , but you do n't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it ! sleep md is a total rip off
1	there is no better shaving cream . i am disappointed you are out of stock
0	i have been using cross product for lat 15 years . this product which is made in china , has highly disappointed me . the finish of the pen is very poor . gold plating is of a poor quality . it has some patches of a different color . the body has sharp edges . overall it has spoilt my impression about cross products . regards r.p . kal
1	just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived melted as noted by another reviewer . i ended up placing in the fridge , and then taking out before eating . turns out , i did n't find them that great directly from the fridge . also , they just did n't taste as fresh as the ones i buy individually from wal-mart . i could n't tell if that was because they had melted , or just were n't as fresh to start with
0	i did not like it . it was not as i thought it was going to be , i thought it would give me a closer trim .
0	product does not generate enough heat to provide relief to sore , aching muscles . the `` massaging '' action is actually a vibration action . when heat is switched on , the vibration action is reduced dramatically
0	i have gone through 3 of these straighteners ( i know , you think i would have learned ! ) however , my first one was lost , my second one stopped working in a matter of months , and the third one stop working in less than a month ! ! i purchased the third one ( despite what happened with the second one i had bought ) because it was an affordable price , i liked the size , and when the second one i had did work it worked well . unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works ( causing obvious problems ) . i would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive , but i think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for
0	was impressed by the attachments and the how-to video but the clippers were of poor quality and pulled on hair rather than cutting it . my 5 year old was in tears within 30 seconds of use . i returned mine for a refund . make sure you test clippers before buying i
0	it was an awkward mess - smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered , much less fit securely . it 'd probably be easier without the trays . i do n't know if they work or not . i gave up . i want my crest whitestrips back
0	this item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly . also it does not work well at all . if you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least . many times it stays flat and when it does `` rise '' it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs . i would have returned the item , but i left it for my mother when i had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time i returned my 30 day window was closed . do not buy , you will regret it if you do . i wo n't even put this item in a yard sale , because i would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it .
1	my husband and i love this thermometer for our own use - let alone the grandkids ! it 's fast , easy , and reliable . highly recommend it
1	this humidifier is easy to refil and not a big eye-sore even in small rooms . also , stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers . would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours . which i guess it 's good that it 's easy to refil . the price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 . i think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price . perhaps you pay for the convient size . overall , i really do like this humidifer and is the only one i like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size .
1	i recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this neutrogna produst at costco for approximately $ 9.00 . $ 22.00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at amazon
1	this blood pressure monitor is everything i was looking for and the price was certainly right . thank you . it works perfectly
0	i bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut . it pulled the hair , and did n't cut well . my husband kept complaining that it hurt and was pulling . since i could n't finish , i had to use our old clippers to get the job done . this was so disappointing , but i guess you get what you pay for .
0	let me start by saying i think the regular guru energy drink is the best on the market . i only wish i could say the same about guru lite . there is nothing positive about this drink . it is awful ! i was very excited about trying the lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage . you might as well take a ginseng or ginkgo biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth . if you are big fan of the regular guru stay with it and do n't waste your money on their lite version .
0	the only thing that i have really used out of it has been the nail clippers . otherwise , i wasted the money on it and could have put it towards something more useful . well , i guess you and learn . it was my first baby , everything looks great and needed
0	you could get the same info on `` percentage '' of body fat by going online . think about it : how does a scale `` measure '' your body fat ? good question . so i went to the website of the manufacturer and ... surprise , surprise ... there were no details about how this worked . it did , however , note what it was supposed to detect and how that might connect to body fat . the scale supposedly measures something called `` electrical impedence '' which sounds pretty complex but really is n't all that hard to understand . all it means is that the more fat you have in your body , the more `` impedence '' you have and the higher the body fat reading . electricity does n't flow as well through fat and the scale is supposed to detect that . but here is the catch - getting an accurate body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just stepping on a scale , especially if the consumer ( buyer ) of that scale does n't understand the factors that are vital to an accurate measurement . what you have in your body when you step on the scale is one vital factor . here is just one example of how easy it would be to get a bad reading : if you are dehydrated from not drinking enough water or , conversely , you are overhydrated from drinking too much water or you have n't measured your body fat within a certain amount of time after exercise or you 've been standing too long or you 've eaten recently ... ..you are very likely to get an inaccurate reading and you 'll be confused by the variation in readings from one day to the next , not knowing what factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading . even worse , you 'll have no real idea of your body fat . from what i 've seen , these scales do provide accurate weight measurements.but when it comes to measuring body fat , the ads or website do not seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you step on the scale at the wrong time of day , too soon after exercising , if you are thirsty , etc . so save your money . if you are working out regularly , eating right , getting in shape , etc ... .odds are that your body fat is dropping and you 'll see signs of this . you do n't need this scale to prove it ( although you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat some other way ) . signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles , looser clothes and ( often ) a more streamlined figure . your metabolism is likely to be more efficient , assuming you do n't overeat too much . if you absolutely have to know your percentage of body fat , just ask your local physician , trainer or gym director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so . if you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level , your body fat should go down , assuming you do n't compensate by eating too much . so do n't count on this scale to give you the consistency or quality of a detailed and controlled body fat measurement . it wo n't .
1	i was skeptical about buying this at first , but after seeing it in allure , and reading the various reviews on amazon , i decided to try it . i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised ; it does what it says . it wo n't work on cyctic acne or if the pimple has already come to a head . it does work on pimples that are just beginning.. those hard , tender knots deep under your skin you just know are going to be huge in a day or two . i 've used it on two pimples that were red bumps , and both were mostly gone within 24 hours . completely gone in less than 3 days . usually it would have taken 7-10 days for them to go away , and it would have been ugly
0	i chose these bags partly because of the reviews that i read on this website and because they made economic sense . i gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed . i have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply . however , when thawing these bags out i found that i was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top , but from a seam at the bottom . i later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes , these bags are better than their competitors , but they were not good enough for me . i have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place . my solution was to use bottles . they too have disadvantages ( take up more room in the freezer ) , but i feel that they are a better choice
1	the toothbrush is great , feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned
0	i was not at all satisfied with the nightguard , but the company accepted the return without question and refunded my money promptly
1	this nature made product is excellent . however , readers should be aware that this products does not contain iron for a very good reason . taking iron supplements sets you up for potential health problems if you are a woman over 50 . i hope the other reviewer takes note of this .
1	replacement blades are a must . the razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases . but , if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day , as i do , then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so . the reminder on the razor is only a suggestion , not a command . after all , it does not know when the blades get dull . so , i simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when i feel it is necessary . one thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin . until then you may have a little irritation . another problem i have solved is the hair on my neck . i use to think the harder i press the razor , the better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got was a rash . i discovered that if i simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness . replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you
0	this item was disappointing because the suction cups wont stick to the bathtub unless it 's a completely smooth surface . most standard tubs have some sort of a nonslip surface
0	unfortunately , my experience was completely different . starting with the unprofessional shipping . shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material . shaver and trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page ! ! i felt mislead by the pictures . another person said how impressive the shaver is . i had the exact opposite experience . i picked it up and i was more than underwhelmed . the shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight , not the motor . not to be mean , but the shaver reminds me of something i might pickup in a 99 cents store . the other day i found a far better shaver from remington for about $ 8 in my local raley 's store . of course , to find out about this seiko shaver first hand you 'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item , because donner charges a 35 % sanitary disposal fee if you open the item . on top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable . on the other hand , if i return the $ 8 grocery store shaver to the store , i 'd get a full refund , if i 'm not happy with the product . ok , so how well does it shave ? not bad , but also not any better than the $ 8 shaver from my grocery store . the blade component seems extremely flimsy ( essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic ) and if you do decide to use this shaver , you 'll be ordering replacement blades in no time . all in all , i was not happy with my purchase in the least . $ 60 spent on something that should be around $ 10
0	i bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option . it was not easy to use , as you have to put in your information unless you want to use kilograms , and you still have to enter your height in meters . all that aside , it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15 % . am i an athlete ? no . am i female ? yes . is 14 % body fat possible ? ? ? well let 's just say it is highly unlikely . i ca n't comment on the water numbers it gives me because i do n't really have anything to go on there , but even at my fittest i was over 20 % body fat , and that was a while ago..
1	my 16-year-old daughter used this on problem acne on her back and shoulders with noticeable results by the second day - existing blemishes healed , no new break-out . she 's excited . no harsh benzoyl peroxide ( active ingredient is salicylic acid ) . the body scrub has the little exfoliating `` beads '' in it ( not mentioned on the bottle ) - so it makes skin feel smooth immediately . and the fragrance is very light , clean ( gender-neutral ) . also , it 's very concentrated , so it goes a long way - making it easily worth the money as far as any body wash goes ( and amazon 's price is better than the in-store price ) . of course , everyone is different when it comes to acne treatments - but it worked here .
1	i 've been using the omron hbf-306 body fat analyzer for a month or so now . so far i 've been very impressed with its consistency . however , i would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the omron 's measurements to see how accurate it is . it 's well built and very easy to use . once you set up your profile , it only takes a few seconds to get a read . i would give it 5 stars but again i dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with . still a good product at a good price .
1	i used aveeno moisturizer and thought i would try something new . i have eczema on my face ( around my eyes , nose and mouth ) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days . my skin is very sensitive , and have experienced burning with other products , but not this one . i sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy , yet strong enough to tackle dry skin . i highly recommend it
0	this scale is too small , i have size 11 feet and my feet dont fit on the scal
0	waking up to this product 's sound and light is delightful . trying to read , at night , by the `` daylight '' bulb is not delightful . the light is too dim . i 've done the things suggested by instructions and other users , to no success . i must agree that , for the price , this product should have better sound and quality . that leaves us with `` great idea , lousy execution !
1	i already own a syncopro shaver so i decided to get one for my dad . he had been asking about electric shavers for a couple of weeks prior to me purhasing one for him . the reason i choose braun is because i love my shaver and have never had any problems . just keep it clean and buy the replacement parts when needed and you 'll be ib great shape . i love the way it shaves nice and clean ! ! ! ! i trully recommend this product .
1	i am having the same problem . i ordered this product from amazon on august 26 . it is now october 26 . i have not recieved it yet . i have never had this problem with amazon before . i may have to cancel my order too and go somewhere else . it is a shame , because amazon does have the best price i have found so far . i gave it 5 stars only because i had to give it a rating . i wanted to be fair to the company , but i have honestly never used one
0	i bought this curling iron impulsively , as i perused through the `` gold box '' items some time ago . when i first received the it , i was amazed at how well it worked ; it heated up quickly , and did a wonderful job on my hair . after a couple months , i turned it on , left the room for a minute , and came back to find the tip melted off , hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached . i thought about returning it , but decided ( rather stupidly , in retrospect ) to continue to use it ... big mistake . it heated up way beyond what it should have , even when i put it at a `` low '' setting of 5 . when i attempted to use it , the sizzling sound indicated to me that i had , indeed , made a mistake . the next day , coworkers were commenting on my lovely new short haircut . if you 're really interested in purchasing this item , please learn from my mistake , and if the tip melts off , take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair
0	i lovelovelove dark chocolate , ( and other strong , pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer ) but these taste just plain wierd . it 's not terrible , but i can taste the hoodia , sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate . i think they work at reducing hunger , but they give me gas so bad i ca n't be sure if i want to eat less because of the hoodia , or the gas . maybe i 'll try the *regular* chocoleans , but i wo n't be buying this again . fyi : i absolutely love the phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix . i have no problems with that . tastes great , works great . and no gas !
1	after looking into several reviews on blow dryers , i learned about the revlon tourmaline . all of the reviews were so positive . i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are . the placement could n't be better on the controls . the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive . a very good value
1	i 've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty . clif bars get it right
1	heats up fast , rolls up easily ( does n't slip like old-school hot rollers used to ) , and stays on with the right hot roller clips . depending on the look i 'm looking for , i use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair , keep them on for 10 minutes while i put on my makeup , and voila ! soft , strokeable voluminous hair
1	i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed . dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too , a v close shave in about 2 minutes . i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness . i dont use the cleaning station , i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased
0	though not advertised to humidify a large room , i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room . i tested it , in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room , by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room , and after 2 hours not even a 1 % increase in humidity ! fortunately , i was able to receive a full refund
0	this is the second one of these i 've owned ... my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half ... not an uncommon problem with this , i can see reading the other reviews ... but i thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer , so i bought a second one ... big mistake ! as far as the radio , what a piece of crap . i live about 20 minuters ' drive from downtown houston ... maybe there are too many radio stations around here . it just wo n't lock on to anything , not even the strongest stations . tons of static and stations fading in and out . i bought a pedometer with a radio because i wanted a radio while i walked . if you 're selling a pedometer with a radio , the radio should work . i would give this 0 stars if i could
0	would have been better if i actually got this.. i ordered this and got 6 dr. bronner 's lavender soap with a hemp tree soap bar code on the back . i 'm too lazy to send back and i already opened one and the lavender is nice . but i would rather have the hemp tree ... afraid to order again
0	it does let you shake and mix up the protein well . but no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads . then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere . it 's a horribly cheap and leaky design . i would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it . ( and if you find a good one that does n't leak please post the info here and let me know ) . thanks
0	this product states 4 toothbrushes . that is incorrect , it only holds 3 . this product also states 4 aa batteries or ac adapter . that is also incorrect . you can not use 4 aa . i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me . if those things do n't bother you , it might be what you are looking for , but since it does bother me , i never even tried it
0	i know that this product works for some , but for me it did not . that is why i decided to return it . wahl makes great products , but this product was not for me . my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it .
1	tis is the best joint supplement i have found on the market . thank you amazon for carrying it
1	nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product . i noticed a difference the first time i used it -- there was no residue on my scalp , and my flakiness was greatly reduced . it produced a very rich lather , also . the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients , but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen . i , myself , am sensitive to many products , and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo . i would recommend this product to others
1	i originally ordered a tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks . ( amazon , of course , took it back with no problems . ) i was so glad when the omron scale arrived . it costs less than the tanita but the quality is much higher . the numbers on it are very large and easy to read . also , it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the tanita . i ca n't wait to try all the features . by the way , i weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs . as promised . great deal for the money ! ! !
1	i bought this to try it out based on a friend 's recommendation . previously i 'd always packed a couple old ratty towels with the dog 's stuff before heading to the lake or the beach . now i only need one towel and it dries like you 'd never believe . i have a 65 pound dog that loves the water . i make him shake the water off himself ( a trick as important as sit or lay down when you have a dog this big ) then i towel him dry in less than a minute . i now own 3 of these towels and have purchased them for just about anyone i know with a dog that gets wet . we live in seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes other bodies of water , but we have rainy winters . having one of these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god send this winter as well . i ca n't speak enough praise about this towel . though a $ 30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem daunting , believe me when i tell you this is worth it . you 'll end up buying two
1	i love these bars . i 've tried all the flavors and they 're all pretty darned great . i eat them more for a snack than a meal because they are n't as filling as i 'd like , but they 're great for a snack or sugar craving
0	i 'm a huge fan of the pria line , but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy . i do n't hate them , but will not buy them again . the flavor is pretty good though , just not what i was expecting . i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind . thank
1	hi , i 'm not a `` review '' person , but when i read the existing reviews , i felt like doing this . i used this product for 2 months and i must tell you that it really works ! i 'm hispanic-black woman ( dominican ) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally , but only neck-chin lenght , no further than that . with this product i achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght . i bought again the product to see how longer it can grows ! ! ! i 've been completely sincere with you ... i 'm not a staffer of this product company , i 'm a real and very happy user ! ! ! hope this comment will be helpful for other women . i have only one last thing to say : try it ! ! ! ! it worked for me..
1	it works very well . i bought it for my wives calves . she has thick ones and after working out it become more thick . using this product , her calves become soft and getting thin . i 've used it too , i can relax with it because it helps the blood circulation .
1	i love that stuff ! and now you have n't had it - but i need more - please make it available again . thanks
0	the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these `` packaging engineers '' thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . `` press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . '' ( could they not have said , `` the hour display will blink '' ? i pressed . `` press memory button to adjust the hour . '' i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i 'd like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j r music computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i 'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j again .
0	i am a male . i did a search and this item showed up for men . however , it is way too long for a man unless he is yao ming . it looked like i was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees . i am 5'10 '' tall . also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback . it clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity . i will not ever buy another product made of this material
1	we purchased eight of these ( 6 - 3/4 in . and 2 - 1 in . ) for our beauty salon in 1994 , and we 've never used another brand since . with their quick heat-up time and multi-level heat options , these irons perform superbly for precision curls . i was so pleased their performance that i bought one to use at home to replace my fancy vidal sassoon gold barrel , which only had two heat settings - too hot and burnt scalp . the heating element is so efficient that level 1 or 2 is probably sufficient for most home users . rarely did i have to set the iron at level 4 or 5 , and never above 5 . it takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up . four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use . at the price we paid , our weekly cost averaged out to pennies . if you purchase this product you will -not- be disappointed
1	best hair dryer ever . i have long , thick , curly , frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x , my hair is shiny and soft . the diffuser is also amazing ; i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz . by far the best dryer out there in this price range . granted , it 's heavy , but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones ?
0	i was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it . it is very heavy and i am not a weakling ! it is also very big . with my arm stretched out all the way i can barely get it to my head . because it is so heavy and big i have 'banged ' myself on the head with the 'fingers ' . just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer .
1	what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips
1	i have tried many brands of soy shakes , and this one is delicious.. i sure recomend it to anyone that wants to start the healthy habit of drinking soy . cookies cream flavor tastes like a real shake ! ! i really enjoy this drinks
1	my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old ! !
1	the toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads . if you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex , your teeth suffer . the oral b head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth , you can . i have not had a cavity in years . my pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed . if only these woked on abs .
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now , but i would not reccomend this one
0	this item is rubbish ... it leaks , quite dangerous since water and electricity do n't mix . i got it , plugged it in filled it 3/4 full and had to stop cause water was all over my floor . i have already packed it up and will return it asap
1	this is one of those products i 'd put on my `` must have '' list if i had an elderly parent who could n't handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front door or entrance to any room . for daily touch-ups , these things ca n't be beat . they are extremely light and get all the stuff that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming . of course , i really believe that a doormat at the front door will go a long way in keeping out a lot of the dust and debris . for the stuff that gets by that , use the carpet flick . i tend to shake out my runners and deep vaccum them regularly but i 've noticed that some people who are elderly do n't have the strength for that . because i help out taking care of two people over 90 , this has been a great help to them in maintaining their independence and ability to keep things clean when i 'm not around ... and i 'm all for helping people to help themselves stay functional !
0	these 'cartridges ' sell for about $ 2 a piece , plus shipping . i recently switched from the mach 3 turbo to a merkur double edge safety razor and i can safely say i will never go back . the mach 3 provides a decent enough shave ( much better than an electric , in my experience ) but the single blade is actually much smoother . i pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the mach 3 at $ 1.50- $ 2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days
0	i found this item to be equal to the conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money
1	it doesnt quit dark circles , but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face
1	i bought one of these 'gizmos ' as a gift 3 years ago and i was so happy to find it on here ! ! it is like going to a salon and getting the best shampoo ever !
0	i was attempting to order aveda brilliant anti-humectant pomade , but received aveda brilliant humectant pomade . the packaging is so similiar . did not realize until i opened product that i had the wrong item . either you sent the wrong item or i inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging . i was being very careful to follow every word ... so i wonder . ... does aveda srill make the anti-humectant pomade . i am stuck with the wrong item now that i opened the jar . at any rate , i am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus i am minus the $ 22.53 amount spent
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs . at age 70 those needs are many . after approximately two rounds of trying , it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general
1	i appreciate the gentle , yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent . i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants , so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together
1	the ultrasonic aromatheropy fountain is really unique . the sound generated , yet unheard , causes water to spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like water sound . at the same time , the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on . all the while , led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors . the construction was just a little light duty other than that , very nice
1	i have a few minor quibbles with this razor , but it gives you a nice close , comfortable shave . and is n't that what we want in the end ? i do n't know anyone who buys one of these things for its `` ergonomic design features . '' it holds the charge for a good long time , and shaves your face nice . rinse it clean with running water and you 're done . that 's what i 'm looking for . the only things keeping me from a 5 star review is i 'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running . it seems like it 's always needing a charge ... but that 's how it sounds at full charge . it will take some getting used to i guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus . also , the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated .
1	my daughter morgane , who is now 8 years old , has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy ( yes , there is such a thing , unfortunately ) . the symptoms are very impressive , she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes . she can not move or open her eyes . it makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to `` get dizzy '' . we tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down , to no avail . morgane 's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines , and we try to avoid giving morgane medication as she is so young . so i thought of using resperate as my dad has high-blood pressure and i knew it worked on the breathing pattern . morgane immediately understood how to use the device , it was so easy and even fun for her . it relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines . her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far , she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months . she used to have them every two months . i have purchased another device for my best friend , a long time migraine sufferer . the way i see it , it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing
1	it is really good enough for my need . i have no problems so far
1	i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday , i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - i was surprised because i had n't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air , when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry . like seventh generation 's lavender laundry detergent , i love this product - if you use them in tandem , not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender ( not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products ) , but they come out clean and soft . i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it 's gentle enough to use on my baby 's clothes , too ! i love that it 's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil . it 's also safe for my septic system , so i 'm sold on this product . if you 're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or ca n't find one that smells good to you , try this one !
0	beware ! this thing , even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure , as well as not keep it in one spot , it took the top layer of skin off ! my poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work . ow ! i had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed . and what 's worse , it did n't take out all the hair ... . i could still see some hair here and there it missed , and i thought i got it all . i returned it immediately and got a refund on my money . never again ... . i 'll stick to my good ol ' electric razor instead ... .
1	i am 100 % satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what i paid for . i am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own , where as for a complete trim , i do need my wife 's assistance . if you trim on a regular basis , ie. , when the hair 's not over grown , you will definitely find the job more easier.i recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts . the price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon , else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the thanks giving sale
0	this thing comes with lots of attachments , of which i regularly used only 2 . the vibrating cuticle pusher is silly . as far as all those round discs , it 's hard to explain the physics of this , but suffice it to say that since it 's a rotating circle , you can only use half of it at a time or you 'll experience a bump-bump-bump . the thing rotates at such a speed ( even the lowest of the two speeds ) that even leaving on your toe or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation . what i did use was the smallest pointed attachment , which i used to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle . this was good for when you 're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are starting to grow out . you can lightly buff down that ridge of polish . same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural nail . the other attachment i used , though less frequently , is the bigger cone-shaped one ( kind of looks like the shape of a foam ear plug ) . that i used to lightly go over my largest toenails to thin them down since i have trouble with ingrown toenails . again , it 's a challenge not to create burn when doing so . the nail dryer thing is silly and useless . if you manage to cram your hand into that little scoop without smudging the polish , it does n't do much anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set . buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster drying time . this thing is n't gon na do it . other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails . it 's likely because they tried to use all of the attachments ( which you 'd think you should be able to do , right ? ) . much regular buffing on your nail thins it down and weakens it too much . the bump-bump-bump of the round attachments likely does n't help , either . a couple times i used this for acrylic nails . i have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a few weeks and then hate them and want them removed -- -and i 'm no longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done in the nail salons . so the alternative was soak at home , or just trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out . however , i mention i did this only a couple times . that 's because apparently acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little `` deluxe manicure system . '' after sounding like it was ailing while it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails , it gave a little bzz and then died . i waited a while to see if maybe it overheated . i tried other outlets . nope , dead . so i 'd pronounce this unfit for natural or acrylic nails . if you want something of quality for acrylic nails , invest in the dremel tools that the salons use ( just be sure to get one with a low rpm or foot pedal attachment ) . if you want something of quality for natural nails , go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files , a rectangular buffer , and a cuticle pusher . sometimes the best solution is the simplest .
1	my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the pampers cruisers ( size 3 ) from 4-month-old . it is soft and my baby never have `` rush '' with it . my whole family love this diapers .
1	i love this toothbrush , its easy and it really imporoves your gum health
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower . even though that 's possible , the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head . the shaving head works fairly well , but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better . i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective
1	i got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress . it was pretty pungent , but it felt so good the first time i layed in it . after a couple days it appeared to lose it 's memory and start to dent and crease , but eventually it got back to full expansion . the customer service with this item was fantastic ! we 'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory
0	i have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile . i took trimspa 32 and i think that it did better than this product . i have been taking it for a week , and along with that , i have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch , plus working out . dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week . i 've noticed no change . i am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out . i 'm very hungry before lunch and when i get home i have to take a nap and ca n't work out until later in the evening . i really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level , which is really unfortunate
0	it ran good and i liked the different attachments , but i gave it away because i was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did
1	first of all i am in my early 20 's so i have n't much experience in night creams . i just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after i decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness . i use `` moisture therapy cream '' by olay in the morning before i put on my makeup , and then i use this at night . my skin always feels so soft , more soft than i think it ever did . i ca n't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability , but i can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier . the scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to . i would recommend this product to anyone of any age . it has a good price compared to everything else on the market and i believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun . prevention is key
0	do not buy this iron . it 's fabulous while it works , for which it does merit the one star . but it broke in less than a week . it overheated , or something , and then would n't turn on again . but here 's the kicker : if you buy it from amazon , the company wo n't honor the warranty . i do n't have particularly heavy-duty hair . this is just totally unacceptable .
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued ( like i could hardly move ) . i had been taking a general multi-vitamin from a local warehouse store . i started taking the nature 's plus source of life , and i felt so much better . my energy level has increased dramatically , and i just feel good . great quality product
1	my husband tried this after i bought it and he loves it . it is a great remedy for a hangover or even just a bad morning . it is very hard to find in most drugstores . now i just buy it on the internet . i 've even recommended it to friends who now swear buy it
0	a fine example of how fickle or intimate ( i prefer the word intimate ) scent is to each of us . this is one fragrance that i have not gotten to like . received as a gift more than a year ago , the bottle still has three-quarters . it does have a `rich ' scent but i find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent , not educing a one word description like `sporty ' , `sexy ' , `alluring ' . i do n't wear it very often but i do n't recall a single occasion of `what fragrance are you wearing ? ' with this one . it 's just not my cup of tea so definitely , if you 're not familiar with this scent beforehand ; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day . why buy ? as a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs . as a gift for your boss - you will know he 's coming from a mile away . you need a gift for a guy who could n't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the hee
0	i do n't recommend this ashtray to anyone . i was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and i could not figure out how to put batteries in . other people tried besides me . there was no way to contact the company as their website does n't seem to exist anymore . at least i could n't contact them after numerous attempts
1	i do n't know why most of the reviews are so negative . mine works perfectly , it does not flip-flop , does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience . reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have what is called a `` diverter valve '' attached to my shower head . the waterpik is meant to be installed directly onto the shower head itself . i could not do that , because i have a portable `` wand '' that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to . went to home depot and got an extension and a coupling , kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to `` interface '' the waterpik via the extension , via the coupling onto the diverter valve ... .. wow ! no leaks ! works perfectly . for those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option , go to home depot , lowe 's or a hardware store and what i wrote above will work as it did for me . enjoy
0	woolite bags waste of money . plan on sewing in your own zipper , cause the one that comes on it will fail probably within the first 4 uses.. maybe the 1st . keit
0	i 'm not sure if i just received a defective pen or what happened . my general experience with cross pens has been very positive . this one , however , is awful . it does n't write smootly and leaves ink everywhere
1	very happy with this purchase . received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [ ... ] credit card . it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors . i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also , the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
1	just love the homedic foot bath . easy to use and very ssothing on the feet . the pedicure attachments are a plus . the price was just great !
0	i have to clarify this is not the same as youthful essence . it does not work the same and the product is not the same . i must clarity that ... i dont want to confuse anyone here . youthful essence for instance is not pasty or harsh , or gritty . it is very smooth , and makes yours skin incredible and soft
0	i really wanted to love this fragrance ... after all , it is quite expensive and i 'd read rave reviews on many websites ... but after one spritz i sold it to a friend of mine ! my favorite perfumes are beyond paradise , ralph lauren romance , ralph lauren style , and dkny be delicious . light blue , to me , smells overwhelmingly of musk . i wore it all day and i ended up feeling nauseous , with a bad headache . this must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me
0	i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv/dvd set ... ..too bad , i liked the large numbers and light .
0	i have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem . they are n't dragon feet , but they do have to be softened pretty often . i have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when i saw the artemis heel smoother advertised , i decided i had to try it . it 's a waste of money . the appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml . in fact , i have a dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better . the artemis appliance does not scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on . it comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma . i would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing . save your money .
1	i am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because i constantly burn . i have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied . i went on my honeymoon to the maldives in november and was able to stay out in the sun , go swimming and i did not have to constantly reapply . i did n't get burned once ! bull frog superblock is the best sunblock around
0	i have a honeywell humidifier that is on my personal top 10 `` must have '' items . i figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve . i was wrong . there is no improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area . the water actually smells funny with the cartridge in . plus , i have noticed that the little beads inside fall out , and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals . they 're so little it 's hard to see them . not a huge deal to me , but i 'm sure it could pose a problem to someone . all in all , i would rather purchase purified water , or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these , since there is no real difference .
1	man these things are the best . they can handle whatever issues i throw at them . i 've done considerable load testing as i 'm a truck driver who makes infrequent stops . thanks for making my life easier . i 'm totally back into life with depends
0	i 've been using this shaver for almost a year , and am disappointed with it . for years , i 've used the older style remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism . i suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better , but i never got used to it . i find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because i feel like i 'll drop it otherwise . the big problem is with the screen . try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen . otherwise , the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood . to clean , it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly , but getting it back on is tricky . if not very careful , it goes on unevenly and gets stuck . with practice , it usually works the first time . the funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall . it looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s
1	this handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills . it is easy to set up . just put in the # of hours between your doses , 12 or 24 hours for twice a day or once a day medications . i use two of these . the timer counts down the hours and then chirps . when you silence the alarm , it automatically starts the countdown again . the storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when i travel . most of the time , i just use it to remind me to take my pills . i wish i knew about this a long time ago
1	i first used this product when i got a straight razor shave in a men 's salon awhile back . it really made for a smooth shave , which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave . by the way , i do n't recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as i foolishly did . your face will be very sore . it took me 10 years before i got another straight razor shave , and i hated it as much as the first time . i 'll never get another . however , this oil product made the shave tolerable , and it makes daily shaving fantastic . this combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave . it 's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward . buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave , and you wo n't be disappointed
1	i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b/c washable ones were sufficient . with my second child , i did both and i found these to be the best b/c washable ones are not enough . they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed . they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched . they are very thin and discreet . other pads are not as big so not enough overage . i never bother with the adhesives b/c they do n't work . they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk . i just wished they were softer and less paper like
1	i 'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs . at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads ( about 10-20 of them ) . that was before . now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore . it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place . the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless .
0	i followed the instructions and did n't overuse it . the motor went after 2 months . i miss it so much that i am considering getting another one , even though i never got my money back for the first one
1	these bars are supposed to be for women because they are lower cal and have more calcium . i think there are other factors as well . men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough , but they say that they need calcium and protein too . i really like the key lime flavor it is great . i like lemon also and the chi tea . i like those flavors because they are light tasting and i do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do . the lime reminds me of the florida keys . these are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out i did not eat another man ciff bar . i used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when i had a busy life . thankfully my life has slowed down now . it is good grab and go food
1	my grandfather found a vial of old spice in his navy kit when he joined in 1943 . he continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age . i began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious : old spice is conservative and masculine , distinct and time-honored . it 's not a trend ; it 's a statement of manhood . if proctor gamble obliges , my own grandkids will be using it
0	do n't buy this product . i went through two units with the same problem . the trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade . within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached . further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed , wahl should be embararssed . it did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove , the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that i would have given it no stars if possible . the fact that i returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth
0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf-203c cascadia showerhead . it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs . i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal . sedondly , even with the head made of plastic , the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it . we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall . we installed it repeatedly , following each step of the instructions every time , thinking we were missing something . i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it . it gets very hot/warm very fast and is very comforting . i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches . i would recommend this product to anyone . i 'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback , save yourself money and do not buy this product . it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lense
1	unbeatable for the price ! worked fine right out of the box . easy to use and easy to understand instructions . i 'm glad i bought it
0	i bought this item for the warmth . the heat level is so low that i never can tell when the heat is on . as for the massage , it 's about what i expected - no good at all . overall , i would say this item is worthless .
1	philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards . most of the low price aed 's use camaera batteries . my defibrillator has a long life lithium battary . i wo n't risk someone 's life on store-bought battaries . walt blankenshi
1	as a dentist of over 20+ years experience , i have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one 's teeth . the unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities ( especially in kids ) , and inevitable gum disease in adults , which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss . mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key , and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline . the bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime . i have heard all the excuses for not flossing : the floss is too hard to handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers are too fat , i 'm too clumsy , the floss hurts my gums , etc , etc . this disposable flosser is great for kids , who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser , such as the `` flossaide dental floss holder '' , which i recommend for adults ( see my review ) . i have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and i strongly recommend it to you as well . one still has to develop the habit of flossing daily , and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing , making it a breeze . get it and save your teeth ! jim `` konedog '' koeni
1	pik stik reacher/grabber did exactly what it said . i used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard . i 'm 5'4 '' and did not have to bend over to pick up things . it picks up coins , small pieces of paper , as well as jars , and leaves/gumballs from outdoors . i am completely satisfied
1	he 'd always had problems with frequent canker sores . after he tried this ( on a recommendation from his dentist ) , his canker sores went from 2-3/week , to 2-3/year !
1	i love the smell of an essential oil in the air . i 've tried tealight burners , a smear on a low-burning lamp , and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy . the pearlessence spa mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time . because i live in a humid climate , i was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture . the cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air . the light show of the base can be turned off , but i like it most of the time . product was offered for $ 10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain , and shipping was free with my order over $ 25 with other products .
1	the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do : remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root . what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving , and when it does , it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving . i do n't think it hurts much , though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others . the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily . i am very happy with this product
0	the sleep guard did not keep my mouth open enough at night . my jaws still clenched tight
0	although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .
0	plain and simple i 'm 32 years old and been dianosed with hbp since 15 years old . i 'm on three medication for hbp . i order this then i wait for it to come . i jjust happen to go to the doctor today , he takes my pressure and tells me its 113/100 . when i arrive home one hour later , the device is waiting for me . i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101/75 . sending the unit back
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight . this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out . not only did it not work for anything , it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass . also , it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener . needless to say , i 'll be taking this back for an exchange . i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair
1	it takes some getting used to , but once you do you will love it . it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush , electric or other , that i have ever used . you feel at first like it is totally strange ( it is ! ) . does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else . i have no buyers remorse . i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person . you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle
0	i bought this pricey little bottle of lens dr. hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake ! it did nothing but make it worse ! after i saw what it did to the lenses , i had to scrape and scrub to get it off ! i hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product . a big rip of
0	these wipes are very rough . we bought these when our daughter was first born and i ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime i used them . if your baby has sensitive skin i would recommend the huggies newborn or the huggies supreme wipes . wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are . imagine how your baby 's bottom feels afterward
0	i own a more expensive braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who i was n't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush . after 7 months , the toothbrush wo n't turn off-something is shorted out . unfortunately i no longer have the receipt . my more expensive model which i use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years
1	i got what i expected . it 's functional and not too poorly made . the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp . i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great . the rolling wheels still have no function for me , but they do n't get in the way
1	they are a nice compact size for travel . they work as advertised , just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated `` quick curl '' time
1	my last braun razor was model 6550 , which i purchased 7 years ago . the braun 8975 is a pleasure using , quick and close shave . the technology has come a long way . i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet .
0	the shampoo works fine , but it has a very different smell that i was not expecting . it smells kind of woodsy/spicy
0	i suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something . but ... ... dear god that thing is ugly
0	these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used to buy them . i first bought these pills last year in june 2005 after hair formula 37 's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage . well , these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned , and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy , and it did absolute nothing . i said to myself , like hair formula 37 , that maybe i just need to give this more time , so i bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all . this product might just work for others , which it has , but it certainly did n't work for me . i must admit that i brought this on myself , as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway , and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills are too damn expensive , so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work . the fact that it does not is infuriating because $ 39.99 + $ 7 in shipping , with a total of a little over $ 46 , is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing . thus , i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money . and if you are going to , please do n't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com .
1	alka-seltzer got it right and in a big way . drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment . i prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus .
0	i was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad , since i just returned mine after one use . perhaps the one i got was defective , but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and was n't hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle . i also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area , and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear . the placement of the strap does n't allow the pad to conform to the body , but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center , not the rest of the pad . i realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm , but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly . for the time being i 'll keep wearing thermacare ( tm ) back wraps ( which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now ) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat . also , this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where i need it . if you need intense heat for a sore back , i 'd skip this heating pad
0	i have found that the ms-5700 to be very loud . the braun 8995 that i replaced it with is very quiet . the plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel , and look , it makes it hard to hold onto . i have found that the shaver dos n't give me a very close shave compared to the braun 8985 shaver . the solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace . as you have read i have replaced the ms-5700 already with the braun 8985 , and am very happy with the change . the braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit , not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner .
0	ok ... received this item last night ... used once , and in the process realized i was pointing a laser beam on my skull . given the directions say 3 times a week , 15 minutes per , i would have to do this for a long time with no proven results ... save yourself the time ... do this ... go to google and type in `` forum and hairpro '' . you will find next to nothing regarding information for this product . i made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation ... after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $ 500 has mixed results on the online forums . not to mention that viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product ... if they do n't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual , how much time did they spend creating the actual product . the box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it . these lasers may work , but with all the research i did ( after the purchase ) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done . i felt ridiculous using the thing too . i am just annoyed because again i got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals .
0	the reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller . ( original order was shipped to amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers , and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm . the weighted base does keep it from falling over . unfortunately , the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device . if the user turned the adjustment knob too far , it and the nut that holds it together would fall off . the nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device . the knob actually turns the nut onto the screw . presumably the device is for someone with low vision . if the small nut falls to the floor , i 'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it . my advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens ... . and if possible , try the device out before buying .
0	in my experience with this product , i had no significant hair growth . very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it , and the amount of pills you have to take daily ( ugh ! ) . however , i gave it a two because while it did n't grow my hair , it did change the texture of it . my natural hair is very coarse , and while using the hf37 it became really soft , silky and manageable . nice , if that 's what you 're looking for a hair vitamin to do . but as far as hair growth ... absolutely not recommending hf37 for that
0	because if you do , this is the unit to do it with ! the combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and/or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro 's internal circuitry with metal deposits . no , i do not work in a metal shop . i use my computer solely in my apartment room . yes , it is from the humidifer . the dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas .
1	this product is simply phenomenal . i 've seen better results using this than with department store brands
1	great product , the girls had a blast with it . real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair . great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled ! although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair . not all the time though . still a fabulous product . would highly recommend it . my niece wishes it came with more gems
1	i was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway . it does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed . this has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it 's time to give in and buy a new one
0	i do n't know if it works or not - i just received it and all i get on it is a low battery reading
1	this is a great little dryer if you travel , or just for home use.well worth the price . cookiema
0	i bought this shaver about one year ago . for years i was using braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition . in spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan i gave panasonic a try . shaving is fine , it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge . after about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge . month later slowly went dead . exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards , what make me to believe to those people writing reviews . you would expect more shave for $ 100 . today i went to buy braun shaver .
1	i absolutely love this scale ! it is easy to program and enjoyable to use . best of all , it 's beautiful to behold
0	just received two of these . yes , how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it . the quality of the casing is really poor . the plastic is very flimsy feeling . the labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box . they show signs of just simply being really old . the instructions are written in many languages which is fine , but there are things they fail to tell you . i also ordered the juice aa 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead . the charger blinks red with those batteries , but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means . if you go to the juicebattery website , they do not mention this product anywhere . not even when you search for it . a good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product . the company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now . as with many things , made in china ! i got a few more days yet before i need to return them via amazon 's return policy which as we all know , rocks !
0	i got this curler set , and i completely regret it ! i used it once , and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy , and there was a bump from where the clamps were . it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down . i would n't even give it one star ... take my advice- do not buy this !
1	recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective . somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom , and i do n't have any trouble sleeping . i use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night , and have the hardest time getting back to sleep . i hardly ever wake up at all now . great product , and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep
0	it took my 3 1/2-year-old 10 seconds to defeat this . it took me about 30 minutes to install it . pretty ineffective , as far as i 'm concerned . your mileage may vary
0	why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to ... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
0	i was offered one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty . so good , in fact , that when i got home i went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where i could buy them . just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list . that was probably a mistake on the manufacturer 's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up . oops ! this bar has a whooping 25 % of your daily allowance of saturated fat ! not only that , but the fat is palm oil . this might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us . a commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person 's need for a lower fat ( and healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated for extreme physical activity , sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops . bottom line : read the label , weigh the health risks and if you want to support the troops , there has to be a better way than eating hooah bars .
0	this product is called a `` bouffant style oversized '' shower cap . it is so small that it would not fit over my wife 's head . the product features list claims it is made of `` soft , pretty fabric . '' in fact it is made of thin , crunchy plastic . it is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked , overlaps and has threads hanging in several places . this shower cap went directly in the garbage
1	i really do love this item . i 've been using it without fail since the day it arrived . i have n't had any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone . i hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor . the only problem i have found is that i ca n't grip things and have the monitor continue working . so when i am lifting weights i have to leave that finger extended , when i 'm using the eliptical trainer i have to leave that finger extended . now that i 'm used it , it is n't a big deal . it is accurate . so far it has agreed with all other monitors that i 've checked it against . so with the one minor exception i highly recommend it
0	i like to use the wet wipes , they 're good products . i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well . i received the package this week . all seals of three boxes were broken , lids fell off , and the wipes were everywhere in the package , they were dried up , but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet , and it almost fell apart . what a mess it was !
1	great piece of equipment , no guessing how accurate the scale might be with this great healthometer
1	yes , i did feel a difference . benadryl is not effective for me so i was sceptical . i am glad i found this . i use for when i need to sleep in an unfamiliar place
1	necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary braun electric toothbrush . i foung amazon.com 's price for this item cheaper than costco or sam 's club ! ! !
1	my daughter and i have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like , and never found one that was completely satisfactory . she has oily skin prone to breakouts , and mine is combination . every one we tried always left a greasy feel and look to the face , even the ones that were supposed to be oil-free . finally , i came across a review of this product on paula begoun 's website ( www.cosmeticscop.com ) . the review sounded good , so i went out and bought some right away . my daughter and i both love this product ! it 's the only sunscreen we have ever used that does n't leave a greasy feel or look to the skin . it dries to a matte finish , and works very , very well under foundation , too . without foundation , there is no need to use powder to kill the shine . and it feels so light on the skin , you barely know it 's there ! if you have oily or combination skin and have never found a sunscreen that does n't look and feel greasy , try this one ! it 's the best !
0	this thing is unbelievably lame . it does n't massage . it vibrates . y'all have sat in massage chairs before at sharper image or brookstone . they can be really good , with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage . this thing does n't even resemble those chairs . trust me . i am sitting in one now . it is my main office chair . i have not turned on the `` massage '' function , or even plugged it in , since about three days after i bought it . the `` massage '' feature is more like an annoy feature . it just shakes you around a bit , but does n't actually feal good in any way .
0	after hearing about this product and reading the reviews , decided to get one for our newborn baby . the problem however , is that this does not cover the entire room even on its `` high '' setting . over the course of an hour , i would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room ( 12 x 12 ) . i put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting . i 've only had this product for a month so i will have to follow-up on durability . first month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room . if it were a bit stronger , would give a better rating . i feel like i will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner , or buy 3 of these ( not practical )
0	this thing messed up my back . it is extremely uncomfortable and i ca n't see anyone liking the feel of it . furthuremore it smells terrible . do not buy this product - you will regret it . ( shipping was n't bad
1	these are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare . great product
1	overall an excellent trimmer - this is what i have been needing all of these years . finally a piece of equipment that does it all . i have been very pleased with this trimmer - it is solid , and cuts without problem . i love the adjustments , and the removeable head . thanks remington , and my wife for the christmas present
1	it does a great job , i just tought it wound n't let any hair go , but i gess that 's impossible
1	if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper , then this is the brand and variant you should switch to . if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises ( rapidly dissolves ... ) , i 'd have to give it five stars . it practically melts as soon as it touches water . do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink ; you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue . i 'm giving it only four stars , because it 's not my favorite toilet paper ( that would be charmin ultra ) , but the necessary choice .
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure . we 're yet to verify what the culprit is ... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch . i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor . it 's been consistant , reliable , and informative for both myself and my doctor
0	sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design . one problem though : it is terrible at shaving ! i was using my old braun 6520 , and was quite happy with it . then i saw a good deal for this `` new , redesigned , superb , self-cleaning '' shaver and decided to upgrade . bad idea ! after shaving with it , it looks like i have a day-old stubble . no matter how much i twist and press it , the `` new super system of blades designed by no one other than gillette '' does a bad job . this morning i actually pulled my old 6520 out , shaved off as much as i could with this `` 360 complete '' garbage , and then used 6520 to see how much `` clean up '' it would do . the difference was both very visible and substantial ! i am really sorry i bought this and feel duped by their marketing ... do n't make the same mistake as me . buy something else and save your money
0	i purchased these but had to return them . while the molded strap is adjustable , it only opens up approx . 1 '' . the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5 '' or larger around - at the eyebrows , forget it , these will not fit you
0	i bought this straightener two times..the first time i had it for about 8 months . my friend had bought the straightener and i fell in love , so i bought my own . the first 8 months were heaven . i straightened my hair all the time . then , at 8 months , one of the plates stopped working ! for a while i used it , but it took forever , and did n't straighten my hair well at all . i decided to buy another , thinking that it was just a defect on the first . i bought the other and it did n't work nearly as well as i had remembered ! in fact , it stopped heating up all together within 3 months ! ! another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well . we have both decided against buying this one again , obviously , and i would reccommend you do , too . i have heard that the newest conair straightener is wonderful , and comes with a two-year warranty , so i would n't have to pay again , if it did the same thing to me that this one did . do n't buy it ! unless , of course , you enjoy being ripped-off..
0	worthless . motor is loud and heating not noticable . in 10 minutes hot water became luke warm
1	i really like this curling iron ... - and you definitely ca n't beat the price ! it heats up very quickly , and gives me great curls . the key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair . then , after you curl , make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting to lock the curls down . i always receive so many compliments on my hair ! !
1	i have been using this razor for about 6 years now , probably as long as they have been out . they may be pricey but well worth it . i used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time . i switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little . it is so quick and easy to use , and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams . they do only last for 3-5 shaves , but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream , it 's probably not that much more expensive
0	do n't be fooled by the similar-sounding , inarticulate reviews -- this product is not what you think it is . it contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation . the `` energy fields '' described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity -- they might as well use the word `` aura '' for all of the logical sense it makes . in the words of a company representative : the tingler is not battery operated there is no button . that would be our sqwiggler which has 2 aa batteries located in the handle . you 're welcome to return the tingler for a sqwiggler . the sqwiggler is $ 29.95 please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $ 9.95 plus $ 8.45 for the shipping fees . make your own judgement , but do n't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you 'll be
1	great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne . i began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago . it helped clear up teen acne has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years
0	the foil is a bit misleading , because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves ( under the zipper ) the timmer will catch you and it hurts , a lot . the foil can only be used on straight surfaces . the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle . if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer ... . well , be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
0	i recieved these dead , they do n't fit right in most devices and i have n't been able to get them to work since they 've been recharged , it 's not my charger ... .. waste of mone
1	i love this book light ! it has survived countless drops to the hardwood floor by me and my 2 year old . it works great with hardback and paperback books . this is by far the best book light i have ever used
0	oprah winfrey and kevin costner the leading medical researchers in america think this is a great break through . well gee , if they like it you must too . there is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers `` guarantee '' that this works . after you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening . well it probably is , in your psyche . if that and kevin costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead . ca n't seem to find the `` guarantee '' on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you 'll be the first to benefit
1	i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik
0	stay away from this seller `` salter '' . i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away , after waiting for almost a month
0	unfortunately , this is poorly designed . it is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating ' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive
0	the seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable . the extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support do n't measure up . the snaps that should hold the ends together do n't work . basically , it would be ok if it came with a soft cover
0	after many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers , i decided to give huggies another try because i have a very active toddler , and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable . unfortunately , this comfort comes at the expense of utility . my daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack , when i saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back . just like the smaller sizes , this version does not hold anything in ! ! !
1	this is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer . i have paid alot more for more well known , brand named dryers . i have long thick hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past . buy this hair dryer , you wo n't be sorry
1	i bought this toothbrush a month ago , and have been very satistfied with it . the battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush . the price is good , the battery life is good , and the battery door is very easy to open ! i would buy it again !
1	the knots in my back - my `` spots '' never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer . one day i asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was . he explained the concept , i tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special . the leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying strong pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there . i bought one the next day . you do n't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots .
0	it works , but it takes a long time to really trim it down . very low power , made of plastic . i do n't recommend this product
1	i have seen these in catalogs before did n't give them a second thought . then one day when i was cleaning under around all of my shampoo bottles , etc in the shower , it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos/conditions body wash that i have collected in my shower . so , i ordered one a higher price i am so thrilled that i am ordering one for the kids ' bathroom where i had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc . now it will all be in one place , not messy out of the reach of my toddler ! the other thing that i have noticed is that i do n't use nearly as much shampoo as i did before - i get a few squirts if that is n't enough , i get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand . i know i use far less shampoo than i did before i had this so i am no longer wasting it ! this is just the greatest concept this product is very easy to keep clean it works looks great in the shower . i would recommend this product to anyone ! if you do n't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but i found the 4 section one is just what i needed ; one for clarifying shampoo , one for conditioning shampoo , one for conditioner one for body wash. no more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom
1	definitely the best heating pad i 've ever experienced . i 'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again . this is by far the best and well worth the money . i love that it can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other heating pads i 've ever seen ( that only have `` high medium and low '' settings , and usually the high and medium settings cause burns , or do n't get hot enough , or go from barely any heat to burning ! ) this heating pad 's lcd shows the actual temperature it 's at , which is great . and yes it feels very moist , but not like you 're getting dampness on your clothing . my only complaint is that it shuts off after 60 minutes . i could easily have this on all day :
1	this is the best sound machine out there ... ..i worked in a doctors office where they used these , and they were amazing . my husband can not sleep without some sort of `` white noise '' . we purchased this and our sleep could n't be better . best bet for the money . it 's also adjustable as far as volume , just twist the top . very quick shipping as well .
0	i liked this heating pad so much when i first used it that i immediately ordered a second one ( for what i expected would be a year or two in the future ) . what i liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads , allowing it to conform to the shape of my body . however , the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat . i returned it to homemedics and they ignored me . the second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat . i will not bother wasting the postage to return this one , as obviously homemedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction . i recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product
1	i purchased this for my husband . he hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn . it is even as close a shave as if he used a razor ! i saw it on the consumers number one pick for foil shavers and i am glad i went with their reccomendation
1	no problems . like the small format bottle , easy to store . works as well as anything else
0	terrible reception . tinny speaker . radio does not `` remember '' last used station when turned off . do n't waste your money
1	this razor is fantastic . the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would . but if you are looking for a quick , handy and yet still good shave , this is exactly what you are looking for
0	why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to ... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
1	you wo n't have to use much lotion on your body after using this product . i love it ... .
1	i saw these reading glasses on csi : ny and just had to have them ! it 's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses ... and the wow factor does n't hurt either ! i 've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses . my hair is shortish ( layered to the bottom of my neck ) and i would n't want it any longer if i was going to wear these glasses a lot ... which i do ! they are n't portable ... but they are n't supposed to be . i keep mine in my office where i need to take them on and off the most frequently . i 'll probably get another pair for home but i 'll used my old ones i can put in my case for carrying in my purse . all in all ... i 'm very glad i got them
1	this is very easy to use and quite convenient . i 'm not sure , however , how accurate this monitor is . it seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times . the value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically . then it 's a warning to go to the doctor 's
1	yes it is pricey but worth it . i tried the gilette skin care and liked it . at that point , $ 5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy . so when i bought this i thought i must be mad . but for my skin it works fantastic . it also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses . you get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top . yes you can not see how much is left . but i have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat . at least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get . i have always had good skin so i do not need that much to have good results . it is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence . it leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother . probably the q10 is a bunch of hype . and yes i usually buy sauve or 'swiss formula ' which are much less pricey . i can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces . under $ 4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin ? worth it to me
0	it makes glasses stain . and i return it within 1 week
0	the slippers look nice and smell great . they were difficult for me to get on my feet . the lining was too restrictive . once they were on , they were very awkward and uncomfortable to take any steps . it 's unlikely that i will ever use them on my feet . i will only use the inserts for aromatherapy
1	these wipes are strong , have just the right amount of moisture , and do n't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave . my son had diaper rashes as a newborn ; when we were at home , we could wash/rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering , but when we were out , and had to use wipes , his rash would flare up . after switching to these wipes and 7th gen diapers , the rash went away . later on , i tried pampers again , and the rash came back . using seventh gen really has kept his skin rash free . my older son also has a lot of itching when we use pampers ; much less with these wipes diapers
1	i encountered these at last week 's carlsbad triathlon . they tasted really good and i figured if it 's good enough for the military , i 'll give it a try ... sure enough , the military knows what it 's doing -- it seems to work as claimed . thumbs up , or , hooah
1	i have several of these glasses now . love them . they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck . i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one . good price and good product .
1	i bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where i was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that i could get a reality check on my activity levels . i opened the box , read the easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off the distance of your 10 steps ) , and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day . i was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me ! over the next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you ) ; i literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with no aerobic exercise on day 1 , to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3 ! every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 `` normal '' steps , and increasing the aerobic steps too ( which are tracked separately ) . i can press the mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate to , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , and compare it with the past 7 days as well . it has turned out to be even more fun than what i originally bought it for . i actually feel better , and the fun part is that i am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day ! this has been an eye-opening experience for me , and i keep this on or in my pocket all the time now , just to make sure i keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
1	now i finally have the look and feel of a celebrity . the best product on earth period ! i 've tried all ingrown hair product 's since 1985 beleive me ive ' spent thousand of dollars , nothing comes close to it `` forget about it '' saliylic acid is history in my book . sorry dermatologist their is a cure . i bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006 . since the new year 2007 started i 've already bought 2 bottle 's and i 'm spreading the word . do n't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away . thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face . j. diaz aka ( papi rico
1	since having back problems , especially waking up in the morning , this lumbar extender works wonders for my back . i can easily have a good start for the day from now on ! ! many thanks . b
0	the pick at the back of the unit is curved and does n't work well . the floss is multi-stranded and tends to come apart when used and does n't feel like it is very high quality floss . the head is also somewhat small or poorly shaped so it is also difficult to use . i used the plackers brand before and was much happier with it
0	printed all over the box are the words `` with infrared heat '' . the instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start , and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water 's warm temperatures . this would n't be the case . the water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on . turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice , but does nothing at all to keep the water warm .
1	i bought this product because i had one from years ago that i use when i go to the gym but lost . it 's great at drying me off while i 'm working out and yet the towel is n't wet . i am conflicted though . i bought this one when i lost the one i already had . it 's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original , but i still like it for what it does . i also like the little bag that it comes in , which i did n't have with the original one
1	i used to own a brush from another manufacturer . it never brushed well : the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly . i just never felt i was getting a good brush . after using this brush for about a couple of months , i went in for a regular checkup . my dentist told me my teeth had never looked better . that 's all the testimony i need
1	tastes great , and it 's good for a normal weight training person like me
0	absolutely the worst cream ever ! after about a week of using it , my skin turned very red and then gray/brown ! i developed severe wrinkling and my skin became rubbery and loose . i went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that i had developed elastolytic granulomas over the area where the cream was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a scarring like pattern of collagen . the normal architecture of the dermal/epidermal junction was also lost - causing melanin from the epidermis to fall into the dermis - basically causing permanent discoloration ! dont listen to the false hype on the net - that hype is coming from people trying to make money off this stuff - take the advice of someone who has actually used this product - copper peptide products are not good for your skin
0	i 've been using trimspa x32 for over a year and , with a decent diet and regular excersise , i 've lost over 40 pounds . the x32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all . i , too , decided to use trimspa energy because it was new and improved , but was sorely disappointed . the engergy formula is way too high powered ( 200mg caffeine per pill ) for me and has made me feel `` sped-up '' , sweaty , greasy and just plain gross . and that 's taking under the suggested dosage . i 'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you ... at the expense of dilated pupils , shaky hands and acting sketchy . i do n't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings . i 'm going back to the other formula tomorrow ... that is if i can get to sleep !
1	this is the one i buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office . it is like the one i bought 5 years ago with my first baby , the one that is still humming along . i have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child , a boy who persists in having 'tiny ' ear canals even though he is three now . it has worked well for every other kid i know though . about the variation in temperature taking . my advice is to practice taking your and your children 's temperature while you and they are healthy . for one thing , not everyone has the `standard ' 98.6 degree normal temperature ; and for another thing it is n't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal . it takes practice . a good home purchase . ( for really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success .
1	good for dust storms in desert-like environments . great for looking suave . very convenient for easy on/off .
1	i took `` my '' unit to a monthly meeting for seniors . their machine broke i took mine as a replacement . they liked it so well , they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings . they like all the different aspects of the machine . a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine ?
1	i have never used a roller . after reading the reveiws i decided to purchase two set of rollers . i have long hair . it works really great on my hair . looking at my hair everyone says it looks beautiful
1	27 ounces is a nice size , the bottle is light ( can be dented ) , and water stored in it tastes very good ... .and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy ! another reviewer mentioned a squeal ... ... that would be while twisting the cap on or off . i 've gotten used to that . wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my toyota cupholder ... that may not be an issue with toyotas that are newer than mine are ( 10 15years ) . in the car , on the nightstand , in the canoe or kayak ... ..it 's working for me
0	this product might do for a backpacking weekend with the boy scouts , but compared to a blade razor , or even an electric , it leaves a lot to be desired . i recommend giving it a pass
0	it 's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror , i suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification . the light is not great at all . it 's very dim . one of the good qualities of the mirror is that it 's cordless and comes with an adapter if you do n't have batteries handy
1	i have been using kiss my face olive oil soap for years , and i wo n't let any other soap touch my face ! i found it when i was searching for a soap that would n't make my skin itch all over after a shower . i can tell you that after years and years , my sensitive skin has never once itched after i used kmf ! the soap is mild , with a neutral scent , which is a big plus . it cleans great , but does n't leave my skin dried out . the 8 ounce bars are a bit large , but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that 's easier for us smaller-hands people
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose . i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all ; as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in `` so i married an axe murderer '' . the idea/concept is great but ... i 'll probably return them . unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them . people with really big heads , caveat emptor
0	i 'm sorry that i ordered these online . i should have tried them first . they do not fit round heads . no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit . the bow needs to have an adjustment too . the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off . would not buy another pair .
0	if you 're interested in the chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots . my friend owns one and at first i was envious , but now i rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots . this model has the same shape as the riviera and as i stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic , the riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so i would be skeptical in buying this one . the only reason i gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you ca n't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly .
