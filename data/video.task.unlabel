Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) is on a downward slide as an ambulence-chasing alcoholic lawyer when his associate (Jack Warden) tries to slap him out of his stupor in order to remind him that he is throwing away an opportunity to get back on his feet. Galvin starts going through the motions of collecting information about a case that involves a young child-bearing woman who suffered brain damage as a result of being given the wrong anaesthesia. Some of his old fight comes back to him when he starts to realize the negligence involved, and before he has thought much about it, he starts on the path of what he takes to be doing the right thing. But doing the right thing can be a formidible undertaking. He had once lost a prestigious job and his wife had divorced him after he tried to do right thing. Now, as he struggles to clear out the cobwebs, before he realizes it, he has managed to alienate almost everyone, including his previously very trusting clients, and faces almost all by himself a power structure that is aware of and capable of subverting his every move. The judge (Milo O'Shea) is always eating in his chambers, the defense attorney (James Mason) and his legions of lawyers are constantly winking and nodding at each other: they are like caricatures used as devices to condense the viciousness of self-interest. The greatness of this film especially concerns the script and the acting force of Paul Newman. The contrast is striking between the muddled, uncertain man on the verge of being a complete failure and the flashes of brilliance that he shows as he fights with his back against the wall. Some of the oratory has a Shakespearian quality to it 
Man this movie rocks. Paul neuman is an acting God that should have more Oscars then Jack nickleson. It's a great dark flm that no one should miss 
That was Paul Newman's response to Jack Warden, as Warden massages Mr. Newman's back and tries to assuage him by telling him there will be other cases. ( Pardon me, I always wanted to use the word ASSUAGE in a review ). I live in Connecticut, and my wife and I drive thru Westport regularly, on our way to Trader Joe's. I know exactly where Mr. Newman lives,( I'll never tell ) and I always kid to my wife, " I wonder what Paul is doing today? " Then I jokingly say that maybe we'll see him at Trader Joe's ( grocery store ) or at Mario's ( great place for lunch or dinner). Of course if I ever did actually meet him, I'd be stammering and babbling just like Jackie Gleason used to do in his old Honeymooner's television show. But enough of my dreaming. So, how was the movie? Sometimes there are events or moments in a movie that stay with you for a long time. In this movie, those times were: " There are no other cases..This is the case! " and the confrontation Mr. Newman had with the judge, when he proclaims, " I know about you! " as he taps his fingers on the judge's desk. Classic moments. If I ever had a chance to become an actor, and had my pick of acting coaches, one of them would be Paul Newman. I'm not sure how he does it, but somehow, after watching him on screen for a few moments, I forget he is Paul Newman, and believe he is the character he is portraying.I guess that's the " magic " of great acting. They make it look so effortless. And now onto Jack Warden. He is perhaps one of the most under-rated actors in history. A great performance from a great actor. Back to Paul Newman. The next time you watch one of his movies, watch the pauses...the times when he's not speaking. It's the entire package that makes an actor great. It's the phrasing, the reaction, the eye movements, the pauses and how long he holds them. ( Sure the director has a lot of input too)- but just watch him. What you are witnessing is a STAR in action. As I write this ( June 29, 2006 ) Paul Newman is 81 years old. He may be a little slower, a little more wrinkled, but his acting just gets better with age. ( Watch Empire Falls ). I truly hope he makes more movies. And who knows, perhaps one day I WILL run into him at Trader Joe's or Mario's place. And in true Jackie Gleason form, say to him, " Hubba, Hubba, Hubba. " And that, my friends, will be no act.  
This outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink, decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis. Please notice how Lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama. Go for this emblematic film, where Paul Newman makes a delirious performance. 
His words to the jury, a petition for strength for them against great odds, for himself against greater odds, for a system sometimes blind to justice, and for the victim of negligence who has no voice, puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'The Verdict.' TV bytes and news reports of lawyers' greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best. And the courage and brilliance of "Brown v. Board" and "Heart of Atlanta" exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past. But once in while a movie ('Mockingbird') comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession: to do what is right, or even better, to do what is right against great odds. Frank Galvin, drunk, ambulance chaser, liar, failure, had that dream once but a mistake, an error of judgemnt, a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now, sucking on breath mints and bourbon, handing out cards, working for booze money. His old friend Jack Warden handed him a case, a no-brainer, a lovely Irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead. The Defendants? A squeaky clean, Chaired, lauded, published and handsome OBGYN and . . . . the Diocese of Boston. And Frank's going to cave. Hell. It's the eve of trial and he's been drunk through the 24 months of discovery. And then he prepares for the Settlement Conference with the Dfense Lawyer, James Mason (just positively brilliant) and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos. But a funny thing happens. Lke Marcellus (Burton) winning the Robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first AA meeting, Frank's not sure but something's different. And he begins to wonder if maybe this time he won't cave. Great, morbid, wry, ironic, gallows humor. Warden says after the Settlement Conference, "whadja' think of (Mason)?" Galvin: He's good. Warden: Good? He's the [. . . . .] Prince of Darkness. A cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief. I don't know that there is a better trial movie. People say that Newman lost but wasn't robbed for the Oscar because Ben Kingley was so wonderful in Ghandi. He was robbed. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury 
Paul Newman is great as a despairing, alcoholic "David", once second in his law class, once part of a prestigious law firm, once married...till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury. The above is past history...just mentioned in the film. It is some years after, and alcoholic Newman, with only 4 cases in the last few years, ...has an epiphany...where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens as he gets the picture, so to speak, of a woman treated unjustly, whom he can help. He forgets himself and his troubles, and the people who have pushed him around, ...and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman...against the hospital and doctors who damaged her. He will later awaken the conscience (as the movie hints) of one of the "Goliaths" he goes up against. However, there are pitfalls... as opposing lawyer Concannon is not above using any trick---or person...to destroy the case. Paul Newman's epiphany scene (which I won't describe further to spoil it for you, but which is clearly recognizable) is quite moving. His Goliaths include: The biased, hostile Judge, the "Prince of Darkness" superlawyer Concannon (played well by James Mason, always good at suave villians), the doctors and **most** of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate Deborah Ann Kaye, ...and the somewhat hesitant Bishop Brophy, head of St. Catherine's, the hospital where Mrs. Kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage. Set in Boston, a largely Catholic city (I am told) we here have nominal Catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the Christian "Good Samaritan" story seriously. My family caution: There are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene.  The Verdict implies the barely seen 12 who also are key players...the jury, who must deliver the verdict. Will they go with the letter of the law? Or---its spirit? (If you are familiar with this phrase from the Christian faith, you have the answer...) (Hint of spoiler below) My wish is that brain injured Terri Schiavo had had a jury who could see the spirit of the law!  Instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a Congress that dared (how DARE they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude) to merely ask for a second look at the whole case. Meanwhile, Terri slowly starved to death...Shame on us! Shades of Nazi Eugenics!!! 
a very powerful performance film by both paul newman and jack warden a film of the past delivers jack warden was underrated but in this film he certainly gives his bst paul newman was always an excellent acto 
A searing, moody courtroom drama masterfully directed by Sidney Lumet, the film earned five Oscar nominations in 1982, including one for writer David Mamet. As Frank Galvin, Newman shows a rare vulnerability as a man struggling to redeem himself before it's too late. This film represents both courtroom and human drama at its finest, with veteran player Jack Warden superb as Galvin's only colleague and friend. 
This is one of those mystery/suspense movies that I can watch over and over because it is so well made. "The Verdict" stars Paul Newman in one of his best roles. It was a tough year for Best Actor Oscar in 1982 but it's still a shame he didn't win it then. He plays a ambulance-chasing attorney who spends too much time drinking his lunch and too little researching his limited work. A friend of his with some connections steers a fairly routine lawsuit his way but even that case he manages to mess up. Having tossed away a large out-of-court settlement, he now has to make his case against a well-staffed powerful opponent. That's probably more of the plot than needs to be revealed so I'll leave it at that. Like most excellent movies, "The Verdict" combines excellent writing directing and acting. The supporting cast includes great preformances by James Mason and Jack Warden. There are twists and turns as the movie evolves into a great courtroom drama. Newman is outstanding in his portrayal of a man who suddenly realizes that he is about to blow his last chance at making something of his life. The writer and director gave him the opportunity and he delivered with a home run. This is one of those movies that would be enjoyable for all but the very young. If you haven't seen it yet, then it's about time. 
Paul Newman plays a Boston lawyer on the skids with alcohol who takes on a negligence case against two prominent doctors and a hospital run by the Boston Archdiocese. It's a sort of do-or-die case for Newman, and it goes pretty badly against him, until he is able to get the help of one of the nurses who was in the operating room when the negligence took place. It's pretty much a one-man show for Newman, and he does a bang-up job. We can see into his character thoroughly, and it's not all goody-goody idealism: after he's turned down a $210,000 "payoff" (out-of-court settlement) thinking he has a chance to win, and then his chief witness is bought off, we see him try desperately to get the settlement money back. The trial is pure Hollywood, with the judge, too, against him, and Newman winning the jury over with a plea for compassion and doing right. Jack Warden does a good job as Newman's senior partner and mentor, as does James Mason as the suave and wily defense lawyer. But Charlotte Rampling is a total non-entity as the double-dealing woman who falls in the sack with Newman. There's much hokum and predictability here, but Newman is so good he makes the movie hum. Definitely worth a watch 
I met Cory Everson YEARS ago when she was competing and appearing at body building shows and competitions. So, it was ironic 15+ years later to read out her videos that I knew nothing about (but wished I had before now). I did purchase this based upon an Amazon list and have really enjoyed this workout! I think Cory does a fantastic job in guiding the viewer through a quality arms and shoulders workout. I am a long time workout fanatic, but after finishing this video even I marvel at how "pumped up" my arms and shoulders are. Yes, it's corny with the thongs, big hair and dated earrings, but the workout is quality and stands the test of time. If you can get your hands on this video, do, it is well worth your time and effort 
I just received my 2nd copy of this video, my VCR ate the first one. It is a great video, parts of it are a little cheesy but it is well worth the money. There are 3 sets of 12 reps per exercise, you work shoulders first, starting with the muscle building exercise, overhead press, then you go on to front raises, rear delt raises, and lateral raises which Cory calls toning shaping exercises. She repeats this pattern for all the muscle groups. Then it's on to biceps, the first being 3 sets of normal bicep curls with palms out, then 1 arm concentration curls, then hammer curls. You repeat the concentration curls 2 more times, but for the last exercise in the "tri-set" instead of hammer curls, you do normal bicep curls and bicep curls where you turn you arm in at the top. After biceps she work the forearms, forearm curls, wrist curls, and reverse wrist curls. I usually skip these and insert a few chest back exercises which are not included in this workout. Lastly, it is triceps, you do lying tricep extensions first, then french press, kickbacks and the last exercise is lying close grip bench press which really works your triceps. There is also a brief warmup and cooldown. This workout is about a half hour and very thorough for the muscle groups represented. It does move at a fast pace, and the reps are a little fast, which I end up pausing the tape often for a rest or to finish the set. But that is really the only negative in this video. I think that Cory is a pleasant instructor, she is encouraging, motivating and inspiring. I plan to using this video twice a week in addition to my other workouts, I am anxious to see the results. This is the tape that I am sure I will get them 
Very easy to follow. Slow, precise movements. Go through all the weight lifting exercises and repitions with Cory Everson. I feel fantastic after the workout. It motivates me to make healthy meal choices throughout the rest of the day because I focus more on what my muscles need to perform and grow, rather than what my emotions want me to devour. I am seeing definition in my shoulders and arms. Highly recommended for the home gym 
I have been an avid exerciser for about 18 years - it's routine for me. During that time I have viewed a lot of exercise videos. Cory's videos are absolutely the best. This upper body workout is intense, but not to the point that you become dismayed and want to give up. I have noticed more sculpting in my arms after just 2 weeks (and I have been doing weights for a long time!) There is a bit of fluff in her videos, but in my opinion, it just makes it more interesting and engaging. The important thing is that the workout is serious and is obviously choreographed by someone who knows a great deal about fitness. I highly recommend this video for a great upper body 
This is a fast paced workout......all arms &amp; shoulders...and, one of the very best I've ever done. I saw results after the first week of doing this twice a week. I highly recommend this video 
Taking a look at the DVD case for this, you read a whole different text than what this movie actually is. The DVD case presents a movie that is a romantic action adventure, a children's movie (rated PG) or at least family movie about a hero who gets the girl and everything turns out all right in the end. This movie is rated PG. We open on a boy and his dog, idyllic, playful, nothing to worry about. The music is friendly, the colors are friendly, the land is friendly, everything is perfect. Then a gunshot rings out and the dog falls dead. The boy runs to a villa, where he watches his family get raped and murdered, all very bloody, violent, and horrifying (much like the same type of violence in A Clockwork Orange, actually). This movie is rated PG. We follow this boy's journey through life, not as an action adventure, but as an epic... the story of a man who, after the trauma of his family's near complete distruction, is sent away to Rome to escape the made-up South American land of Corteguay, where he transistions between being an adulterist playboy (much like a less liked and less proactive James Bond, which is interesting because the director made Moonraker), to an apathetic, bitter nigh-rapist, to the potential savior of Cortequay who is only used and abused by its leaders until he himself falls victim and nothing changes for the better. This movie is rated PG. We follow a whole melange of extra characters as they move through their either abused, poor life without happiness, or their empty, corrupted life as the rich, and how they all intermix and intermingle to create a land, Corteguay, that is constantly at war with itself, and how they all add to it their own violence. This movie is rated PG. We follow playboys into S dungeons (again, imagery very alike A Clockwork Orange), young boys becoming men by shooting down rows of prisoners with automatic machine guns, women without control of their independence, civil leaders claiming that "There must be a cohesion of evil and politics," revolutionaries who rape, pillage, plunder, and massacre; prostitute nuns, apathetic heroes, unstimulating sex (and lots of it), children getting killed, and the beauty of civilization and nature juxtaposed with explosions and grimacing Gothic architecture, idealistic moments ALWAYS ended suddenly with pronounced, crippling pain. This movie is rated PG. I'll go out on a limb here and say that it's probably likely nobody likes this movie. It's not likeable. It's well done, but clocking in at just over 3 hours of watching the horrors of humanity being committed again and again while our unsympathetic hero has sex with everything with two legs and makes a living off of it... Even if it was marketed correctly, it wouldn't be approached correctly. --PolarisDi 
A large scale film that just didn't hit the 'let's go see it' list. Good mix of drama, local color, some saucy but dated romantic scenes, plenty of action (plenty of nice vintage WWII armor), backstabbing, shoot 'em ups and Ernest Borgnine as 'Fat Cat' is extra special. Worth watching 
Most people who saw this movie did not understand it, and when it was first released in 1970 the sex and violence were so far over the top for the period that most critics couldn't see the top. The movie, like a lot of the actresses it featured, was topless. Today it is par for the course. The gorgeous photography, however, is far better than what one sees in most modern films. The story is a roman a clef. The fictional South American country Corteguay is not either of its quasi-namesakes Paraguay or Uruguay but Colombia, where much of the principal photography was done. Dax Xenos is not really Dax Xenos but Porfirio Rubirosa, who was not from Corteguay or Colombia but the Dominican Republic, which is not a South American country but a Carribean country. (Harold Robbins admitted this, so there is no doubt.) Rubirosa was not the playboy son of a diplomat. He WAS a diplomat, who discovered early on that he could use his diplomatic skills to become a wealthy man by becoming a playboy and marrying wealthy women. The most engrossing fiction is based loosely on reality. That said, what makes the movie work is its theme. In movies, the character who changes is the main character, regardless of what the billing says, and the only character in this movie who changes is Dax. He starts out a cynical playboy, out to charm his way into the beds and bank accounts of wealthy ladies, and ends up a saint, struggling valiantly to change the world for the better. Alas, for the world will not change, and protects its scumbag identity by killing the irritating Dax, so things can go on being as corrupt as ever. The theme is therefore that the world will not change and perhaps even cannot change. But individuals can. Whatever his failings in early life, before Dax is murdered he thoroughly redeems himself. There is hope, the author is saying, for the individual, but not for the larger context in which he lives. The story therefore combines hard nosed realism with a cautious optimism, and the result will win over the most cynical among us. I know because "the most cynical among us" is the way I would describe myself and the story makes sense to me. If you understand this, the whole middle of the movie, which follows Dax and his friends as they acquire the wealth and power they need to fulfill their respective destinies, makes sense and is thoroughly enjoyable. This part of the film is necessary to make sense of the movie's ending, in which Dax confronts the corruption that has plagued his beleaguered homeland. If there are sex and violence and drugs in the movie that is because there are sex and violence and drugs in the real world in which characters like this live. As one of the characters in the movie says, his people did not get to where they were by being philanthropists. He could have added that they did not get to where they were by being burdened with unnecessary impediments like scruples. Welcome to the world of the upper class. Oh, yes, and the book is not better than the movie. The movie in this case is better than the book. Much better. The book needed an editor in the worst way. The movie had one. It is too long for some tastes, but it works well as home entertainment because you can watch as much as you want in one sitting. Then come back for more later. I have probably watched it twenty times. I will probably watch it twenty more. The best movie by far made from a Robbins novel, only rivaled by The Betsy. Highly recommended. 
This review is based on the VHS release: ADVENTURERS ranks among the Top 10 "Very Best of the BERRY Worst" in my book THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE MOVIE GUIDE (also available from Amazon.com). Based on one of Harold Robbins' trashiest novels, it tells the story of Dax Xenos, a South American revolutionary who as a child witnesses the triple murder of his mother, his sister...and his puppy dog(!). Dax spends the rest of his life confusing sex and death. Among those along for fun in this laugh-a-minute "drama" are a wooden Candice Bergen as his wealthy American wife, Ernest Borgnine in Man-Tan as a Latino father figure, and Olivia deHavilland as a rich woman who hires Dax to be her gigolo. Every element of this one is pricelessly idiotic, from the costumes and sets to the music and sound effects. If you love bad movies, this one is a MUST 
I caught this movie in theatres a couple of times when it was first released in 1970. It impressed me then and still does, for several reasons. First, it has a very good cast. And they are not completely wasted, only 75 percent wasted. Second, it has plenty of sex, violence, and the other human failings that make watching other people so much fun. Third, sure, it's overly ambitious, and falls well short of its grand intentions. But, it is a trip worth taking even if you know you're headed down a dead-end street. Don't listen to the so-called experts. This movie is one that is worth making up your own mind. I'm still enjoying this film some 30 years later, and I think you will, too 
The funniest show you'll ever see. Where in the world are the rest of the episodes? Like the one where Chris learns to spell from consuming toxic waste and the one where they go camping and eat some berries that make them see strange things. This tape is a must for all comedy fans!!!!!!!!! 
Chris Elliott a comic genius.I need help in locating more episodes,especially the one where Chris tries to get his drivers license.looking for excellent quality videos.Thank 
I remember watching this show when I was 10 years old, and I have never forgotten it. I have about 24 of these episodes on tape, but didn't have "Spewey and Me" or "Girlfriend 2000," so these tapes go great with my collection. I do, however, wish that they would have added more than 2 episodes per tape. I also would like to see "Zoo Animals on Wheels" and "Chris's Brain." (The one where Chris learns to spell because of Toxic Waste.) These are 2 awesome episodes, that I do not have, and would love to see a great quality copy of either of these 2 episodes. Hopefully these 2 volumes will sell well, and encourage Rhino to release more tapes. They should read these reviews to get an idea as to what to put on the next volumes. Anyways, I'm just glad I got to see "Spewey and Me" again 
Haven,t seen this movie for years,but it,s still the cult classic I remember, with great performances from all. Still one of my all time favourite films 
This film hit a nerve with anyone in highschool during the mid-to-late 80's, and the commentary on popularity still holds true today. The number of cliques in my school was staggering, and I meandered from group to group, never dropping anchor. I stayed sane, while watching everyone else fall apart. LOL. I knew quite a few "Heathers". All the same basically; school being not so much academic as social. Most of the adult figures in the film are mindless twits, oblivious to the needs of youth. This is still one of my top ten favorite movies 
I remember watching this movie a few years back. I thought it was decent overall. But my biggest question is if Jason hated the world so much, why didn't he blow himself up inside the gym 
"I just killed my best friend." "And Your Worst Enemy" Excellent Dark Comedy.. I love this movie religiously 
The 80s totally rocked, with laid back teenagers who were a little wild, a little care free. Who doesn't love that? Especially when it's in a movie like "Heathers". This black comedy is totally wild, in a very great way. It's unlike any other movie I've seen, everything about it is very special. The language, the situations, the attitudes and actions of the cool but bizarre characters. Veronica (Ryder) is a really great girl, but she is "best friends" with the Heathers. The 3 most popular girls in school, all named Heather. Veronica hates her friends, they are complete snobs. She even wishes Heather #1 would DIE. Veronica meets the wild and crazy JD, and she falls for him. With two extraordinary characters like these, there's bound to be trouble. One accidental (well, sort of accidental) death leads to a series of other deaths, all poking fun at the serious issue, teen suicide. Fall in love with the crazy Veronica and JD as Veronica tries to stop their crazy ways. Laugh your butt off at the lines used in this cutting edge film. Believe me, you have NEVER heard or seen anything like it. You may even pick up a couple of crazy lines you hear in this movie, I know I sure do. Have fun watching these crazy and bizarre scenes that will make you laugh and say "Wow" at the same time. "Heathers" is a movie that is ahead of it's time, teenagers can relate to the characters, it pokes fun at serious issues.. but it is 100% hilarious. Loosen up and watch "Heathers". 
Black comedy at it's best. This film is so brilliant in the way it doesn't sit there and glorify suicide, it just makes fun of what all other movies were doing and the way the media was making it the top story really no matter what. I like that idea. Sometimes I write a review just to make fun of somebody elses. You haev to have that type a sense of humor to really like this film. When Christian Slater shows up for his first scene of the movie doing his jack nicholson impression voth in vioce and in character and pulls out a gun to shoot the second and third person that he conversates with was a pretty surreal moment. Of course we find out that the gun was empty and your heart may slow down a tad. So we continue and find out who these Heathers are. You will figure it out pretty quick, it is just like any other teen movie but manages to give that extra sense of style for the time. And the director does a great job of showing the girls seeming 30 years old when they are really like 16, but then acting their age around any older person that they have to interact with like college students. Don't expect anything real, but more what of these types of people would have been like back in high school if they could achieve that kind of power. Or sadly enough, what probably happened in many schools. But the acting, direction and overall cheesy type of fun just ends up xploding into a great movie. The music will certainly help you through a lot of weird scenes. Picture quality is aesome. The commentary is really good with explaing literally everything that happens. All that you want to know will be answered for sure. The documentary does a wonderful job of explaining how the movie was put together, making of, and a great job explaining what exactly it is about. Also you realize all the greatly talented people who worked with other major direcors/producers amd things all on their own. Also the cast gives you more than your fill of info. And if you can make it through the 100 paegs of notes to read the real ending, it is very trippy and gives you some insight of how they original wrote it. Not just a black comedy but one of the most twisted films ever. But funny. The writer is certainly, what is the word, well , I will go with prolific, he can write for probaably 48 hours straight or so I would imagine. So easily a 5/5 for the dvd realease. And a great movie. 
a film about teens plagued with mean spiritedness and revenge on their minds ends up being one of the best films of the 80's. one of the most darkest comedies with envious contempt. evil at its core, yet deliciously irrisistable. the whole cast is sensational, especially ryder, who still says in interviews today, this is personally her favorite film she has done in her career 
Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done, my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun. The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha. For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
I know I did. Sometimes the pressure of stupid jocks and stupid plastics cant drive you up the wall! This movie is a great representation about the adventures of High School and trying to fit in. It sends a great message to just forget the crowd and do your own thing 
This is a great movie. I think Al Pacino and Robin Williams definitely clicked in this movie. The plot was excellent and Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time 
Al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate A murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it. He has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner. He creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer (robin williams) did it. Very good movie 
This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place.

I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops. First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling "Police, you're under arrest." They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort. Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too? Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough. By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too 
Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, "ever since I saw Batman Begins" and find his artistic vision to be incredible. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice. However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this. 
Al Pacino plays the morally conflicted police officer with some secrets who is doing his best to help solve a murder in Alaska during the long days of summer when the sun never sets. The white landscape and the gray mental clarity from his insomnia make this an interesting psychological morality tale. Patrick J. McGerve 
Christopher Nolan's "Insomnia" is a fantastic film, that manages to top the original. This police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end. Al Pacino has one of his best roles in years.(He's still the man!) Robin Williams was better in "One Hour Photo", but he's not glaringly miscast as others claim.The rest of the cast is first-rate, with Hillary Swank being particularly good. The credit for this film's greatness belongs to Director Nolan. He's created a tense,visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches, and stands as one of the best movies of the decade. 
This is one of the best films I've seen to date and the cast is great. I recommend this film to everyone because it has a great story about a family whose getting by in the United States. 
The sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering. I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie. But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD 
I had to watch this in a college course i was taking. I enjoyed the movie. My Family/Mi Familia describes the tale of three generations of an immigrant family's troubles and achievements. Maria and Jose, the first generation, come to Los Angeles in the 1930's, meet and marry, and then they face deportation. They establish their family on the east side of Los Angeles, and their many children Chucho, Paco, Jimmy, Memo, Irene and Toni. This story starts with the father of the family, Jose Sanchez, who makes a one year journey on foot from Mexico to Los Angeles in order to track down his long lost brother. Once he gets there, he meets and marries the love of his life, Maria. The two of them begin a family and the stories of their children begin to develop. These stories involve Chucho who gets involved in gangs and has to deal with his father for his constant troubles with drugs and the police. Jimmy begins to follow in the footsteps of his older brother but eventually realizes that he needs to think about the future and that this way of life will not cut it. As the second generation become adults in the 60's, the focus of the story shifts to the son, Jimmy, and tells the story of his marriage to Isabel, their son, and Jimmy's journey to becoming a responsible parent. This story shows the life of a family that sticks together through adversities, through crime, gangs, prejudice, no matter what they are faced with, they will be a family. 
I looked at the length of the DVD and thought "this had better be good." It was. I am generally wary of family or individual biography movies, as in my experience, they tend to be episodic and lacking in the coherence of more conventional dramas -- by which I mean, they typically consist of a series of episodes but no clear plot line. That was less the case for this movie than for other family/individual dramas, perhaps because pretty much the same group of people were in the film throughout, and there was an overriding theme or point -- about the immigrant experience, particularly for Mexican-Americans. The story involves a young Mexican man, Jose, who is forced to leave the poverty of Mexico (in the late 20s?) to find family and work. He walks all the way to Los Angeles -- the border at this time is just a line in the ground, as he says -- where he has the name of someone who is possibly a relative. This man happily takes him in, and Jose gets a job as a landscaper working for wealthy Anglos. He falls in love, marries, and has a family. A series of tragedies and triumphs follow, involving this man, his wife, and each of their children. By the end of the movie, Jose is an old man, assessing his life as good. I would say that the theme of this movie is life in a Mexican-American family, reflecting both traditional values and customs as well as the problems of assimilation and cultural identity. Maybe it was just me, but I couldn't seem to get English subtitles to the Spanish to work. Consequently, there was some dialogue that I just guessed at, although most of the film was actually in English, although there was quite a bit of mumbling, so the ENglish subtitles helped. 
Actually this film really deserves 10+ stars! I first saw this movie on pay per view somewhere in the later part of the 90's and you know how there are really only a few titles to great flicks that you can actually remember? Put it this way, 9 years later I still never forgot "My Family" The cast is wonderful the acting couldn't be better. It reaches into the soul of the heart and is one heck of a film that you'll never forget.. 
I admit I didn't have much confidence in this movie at first, when Jennifer Lopez was the actress who played the mother. However, things began to pick up, and the theme of the story began to appear in numerous events. The relationship between the characters is intricately acted out, especially between the bonds of parents and children. Each member of the family is unique; there's Chucho with his rebellious nature, Memo with his desire to fit in and "succeed", Toni with her political endeavors, Irene with her family and restaurant, Jimmy, who is misunderstood by most, and Paco, the eldest son and narrator, who aspires to become a writer. The mother keeps this family together with her strength and love, and the "jefe" seems strict and unyielding at first, but throughout the movie, the audience can see that he really cares about his family. Following the different characters' eventful and sometimes difficult lives, one sees the importance of identity and family 
This film is a true inspiration to me and gives us all a glimpse into the potential for positive representation of the Latino experience in the United States. The acclaimed director, producer and co-writer of this fantastic film, Mr. Gregory Nava, should've received an Academy Award for his masterful direction of this film, and I believe the actors in this film should've been acknowledged as well. At a time where we all need a voice and are searching for a means to express our experiences in the world, this film is such a blessing for us all to watch. Through the eyes of three generations of the Sanchez family, a Mexican-American family based in East Los Angeles, we get a sense of their triumphs and struggles that are universal to the human condition, as well as the racism, discrimination, displacement and the struggle for bicultural identity that they all face together as the seasons change. Jose Sanchez, an ambitious young man from Michoacan walked across the border between Mexico and California when it was literally "a line in the dirt" and took up roots there to start a new life and raise a family. The young Jose is played by a beaming, soulful and spirited Jacob Vargas (an actor who has been made a fool of in numerous films since, in "token Latino roles" such as drug dealers and thugs--what a waste of phenomenal talent!), and is then by the legendary Mexican actor, Edward Lopez Rojas. His beautiful wife, Maria, who he first meets while clipping the hedges overlooking a mansion, while she is the nanny to a bunch of little children, is played by the young Jennifer Lopez, who is beautiful, glowing and full of life and courageous inner strength. The older Maria is played by a soulful and tender Jenny Gago. Other wonderful actors in this film include: Edward James Olmos (Paco Sanchez, their son and storyteller), Jimmy Smits (Jimmy Sanchez), Constance Marie (Antonia Sanchez), and Elpidia Carrillo (Isabel Sanchez, Jimmy's Salvadorean wife--a beautiful actress we have seen far too little of!). The earthy cinematography in this film is comparable to the great murals and naturalistic portraits of Diego Rivera. The vibrant colors and wonderful flashbacks of Mexico make you feel like you are taking the journey with Jose Sanchez from Michoacan to Los Angeles. Beautiful, touching, warm, authentic and lovingly done. We need more films like this to encourage our youth, inspire the generation of today and reach people from all cultural backgrounds. Hopefully, with films like this, we can work toward bringing more projects about life, the experience of Latinos and bicultural identity to the foreground through film 
This is a fine film that stresses the importance of culture and family while never losing its entertainment value. Following the same Mexican-American family from one generation to the next, the film crams a lot into a two hour running time, but the story is effective, well-told, and moving. While some of it was a bit far-fetched, especially Jennifer Lopez's opening bit as the younger version of Maria, the mother, crossing an angry river with her newborn son, the film does pick up and becomes a moving epic about a tough family and their struggles. The casting is terrific, each cast member very believable with their strong performances. I enjoyed this movie and it made me appreciate all my parents have done to keep our family together. This is a terrific slice-of-life made enjoyable by the realism and top-notch cast 
This is a great movie. I think Al Pacino and Robin Williams definitely clicked in this movie. The plot was excellent and Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time 
Al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate A murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it. He has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner. He creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer (robin williams) did it. Very good movie 
This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place. Even though I give this remake 4 stars, mainly because Al Pacino and Robin Williams restrained themselves, and that Hollywood changed the ending. Check out the original. I give the Danish original 5 stars.

This is the best of the atomic-bomb movies, and unfortunately still only available in VHS. Dennehy's performace as General Groves and Strathairn (of Good Night and Good Luck) does an amazing job as Oppenheimer. The characterizations are not the usual Hollywood cliches of professional people and their behavior. It is also just an excellent job of portraying the history and science, but still remains a gripping human drama 
As a teacher of physics, it is of the utmost importance that I teach my students, prospective physics majors and not, the hallowed tennents of the process of scientific inquiry and its necessary collaborative nature. This movie, does a superb job of forwarding that aspect of the nature of science 
Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie: puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)? Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)? What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)? Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad. Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy. Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease. In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind. Isn't that what movie making is all about? 
This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country? I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc. I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please. Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died. I kept expecting someone to call Social Services. And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children. And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all. Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
"In America" takes hold of you right from the beginning,squeezes your heart, and never lets go. A poor family enters this Country illegally, with dreams of a better life for thier family (A young Mother and Father, and thier 2 young daughters) They move smack in the middle of Brooklyn in the middle of an unbearably hot summer. We experience just about every human emotion there is as this story unfolds, and what a wonderful story it is! We see this masterpiece through the eyes (and camera) of the 11 year old girl. We go through all this poor Irish family's trials and tribulations with them,(many of them pure heartbreak) and come out REFRESHED. I think it is the simplicity of the story, and the innocence of this poor family that is so ... FRESH. We experience what the word "poor" truely means.We feel thier loss (the death of a third child) they are still going through, and in short, We fall head over heels in love with this family. We also meet one of thier neighbors that the girls befriend, who is dying,They pull him out of his deep depression at the end of his life, and the family shows him thier love, and offer him lifes greatest gift, thier friendship. Yet we still ache for him, and the smallest child especially when the end comes for him. We do get to experience some joy in his death though, that he got to know the true pure innocent love of this wonderful family before he dies. This movie is a must see, and one of the 10 best I have EVER seen. True, it is a tear jerker, but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more. 
`In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved. The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new. The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah Emma Bolger). Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition. Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect. In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light. That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend. It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states. No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed. As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some. They need each other. The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow. This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness. As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life. This is due mostly to the impressive cast. Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here. I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette. Regardless, her performance was harrowing. She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping. Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season. He was brilliant and deserved some recognition. His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping. And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting. They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow! This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone. It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that. 
In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope. The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs. The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks. Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing. 
Once in a while, movie gem reaches out and touches your soul. I have added this film to my collection of favorites, and those I will savor when I need a gut wrenching cry. I was literally emotionally drained after watching it. The story is set in Hell's Kitchen, among the despair of poverty and addictions. A young Irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life....overshadowed by the loss of their son at five years old. I find myself drawn in the family, deeply sharing their anguish and triumphs. One scene had me on the edge of my seat....at a street fair when the father is trying to win an ET doll for his youngest daughter. I won't tell you the outcome. The youngest daughter, Ariel, has a spirit about her, a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family. She is bold and unafraid, yet she yearns for the love of her father, who is emotionally distant following the death of his son. The oldest daughter, Kristine, is wise beyond her years. She successfully camptures life on her camcorder, which she uses constantly, almost a video diary if you will. The mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart. Her husband has shut her out of his emotionbal life, also, and she struggles to deal with that. She is the glue which binds her family together. Their neighbor, the "screaming man" of the building, is a tormented young artist. The words on his door say it all "KEEP AWAY". I won't give away the plot with his role. A MUST SEE.....I cried, I stopped for a bit, I cried again. I couldn't stop crying. Okay, so I cried at Lion King, too...but that's beside the point. I loaned this movie to my neighbor immediately after, with red puffy eyes. She understands. 
Many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the United States. To this, I respond: We've seen that hundreds of times in films. The same goes for sports films. We've seen the movie Glory Road in other films like Coach Carter, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers. They are exactly the same movie with a different team. That's not to say that these films aren't decent sports flicks, but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genre. That being said, that is exactly what Jim Sheridan does with In America. The story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph. The basic story follows a family of Irish immigrants who come to America with the same notion that all immigrants have: to attain the American Dream. But, as they all sooner or later find out, the American Dream is an ideology that 99.9% of people never attain. They have trouble finding a place to stay, and end up with an apartment at the top of a run down building with many of its residents being junkies. The father Johnny (Paddy Considine) is a struggling actor, who hasn't been able to get a part since the death of his son Frankie, who fell down the stairs. The mother Sarah (Samantha Morton) takes a job at an ice cream parlor to earn the rent money. The oldest daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger) is probably one of the smarter people in the film, and Sarah Bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl. She is the stereotype of the oldest child who is forced to grow up too soon. Her younger sister Ariel (played by Sarah Bolger's younger sister Emma) is the typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions about everything. There are some really touching scenes throughout the course of the film, one especially comes to mind, where the father almost squanders away all of the family's money trying to win an E.T. doll for the youngest daughter. There are essentially three miracles in the film, and Christy, who is also the narrator, relates these three events to a set of three wishes that her brother Frankie told her about before he died. The other great scenes in the film involve the family and their relationship to the man on one of the floors below. When they first arrive in the house, Christy calls him "the man who screams." This man's name is Mateo (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou) and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems. He is sort of the figure of "morality" in the film, often giving out endless amounts of advice. Mateo has some sort of disease (we can only expect that it is probably a venerial disease) and he gets sick throughout the movie. In America features one of the best ensembles I have ever seen. Every actor is perfect in every scene. Djimon Hounsou and Paddy Considine give the best performances in the entire film, and Jim Sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film. While I do agree with one other reviewer about how Christy has a modern camera in a story set in the eighties, stupid facts like these should not detract from the overall message of the film. The overall message, then, is not just about how immigrants face hardships when they come to America; we already know that from previous films and/or experiences. The film has such a deeper message, relating not just to immigrants, but to every person who watches this film. I really do not want to give the message away, but rather I will leave it up to you to go rent or buy this treasure of a film. This is truly one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen 
Human drama and feelings, disregard for stereotypes, great photography, action with reaction and great lesson in self acceptance is but a few of the elements that makes this a great classic. Made me think of my social role and position in life just like Crash did 
In the old days this movie would have been called a "chick flick". Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC. The family consists of a husband and wife with two young daughters who are trying to make it in America as poor Irish emigrants. Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother. One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years 
This is a lovely film; happy and sad. "Do you believe in magic?" Magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love, friendship, perserverance, and the optimism of young hearts. Sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth 
The Hucksters does an excellent job of portraying the cut throat business that advertising is. Clark Gable, playing the suave but ethical advertising man, is the protagonist and he is pitted against the larger than life business tycoon Sydney Greenstreet. Both are pitted against one another in this real life chess match, each making strategic moves of cunning, self-pride and power--Gable, in an attempt at making the advertising business a respectable one and Greenstreet by instilling fear into the bumbling idiots who surround him. Greenstreet operates as though his customers are mindless sheep easily persuaded by fancy packaging and jingles of no substance whereas Gable is convinced that the customer is intelligent and is looking for more than bells and whistles when purchasing a product. Most interesting however is the internal struggle Gable, Kerr, and Gardner are each battling. Gable, basically a good man, is somewhat of a player and finds himself in love with Kerr. Kerr, a widow with children, is a righteous woman deeply attracted to Gable but cannot reconcile with his lifestyle. Gardner, a sultry singer of a sordid background, longs to settle down as a respectable housewife and mother and his her net set for Gable. All three do a magnificent job of portraying the internal struggles of their characters. In the end Gable buckles but does not break before the formidable Greenstreet. Realizing that he cannot continue on working for this tyrant without compromising his standards, Gable passes on the company?s lucrative offer and walks, but not before he has publicly humiliated Greenstreet. Of course, Gable does get the girl in the end. Which one? Watch the movie and find out! 
Clark Gable zoomed back to the pre-eminent place he long held in Hollywood with this smash performance of Vic Norman, the attractive "huckster"; a radio advertising go-getter. He takes with him the lovely English Deborah Kerr, who made her American film debut in this film from 1947. Nearly everyone read the book by Frederic Wakeman back in the forties; it was very popular. The Gable-Kerr team is ideal. Kerr made an impressive bow on the U.S. screen, and the critics took notice. Sydney Greenstreet is great as Evan Llewellyn Evans, who thinks America as a blank space between New York and Hollywood where people buy soap! Producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr. garnered top technical talent for this film and Jack Conway's direction is first-rate. Ava Gardner is mesmerizingly beautiful as the nightclub singer, Jean Ogilvie. At the end of the excellent Luther Davis screenplay, Gable gives out with the kind of denunciation of his brow-beating boss that has been standard cinematurgy for years - the script ribs everything in radio of yore from soap operas to Forest Lawn commercials 
I have ever seen. Nuff said. Enjo 
you wont be disappointed. Very good acting. I recomend this movie. The acting is very good. The actors are awesome 
I am currently a medical student, hoping to have a future career working specifically with HIV/AIDS patients. When I ordered this movie, I was expecting any typical drama movie that is not well dramatized. When I received the movie, I watched it before taking it to class the next day and I was just shocked at how informed I was of the disease. It is so INCREDIBLE! I took the movie to school the next day and everyone that has NOT seen the movie had the same reaction that I had. Even the teacher had watched it before and was still moved by it. If you are unsure of buying it, I can tell you that it is a movie to own if you are into true life dramas. Everytime that I watch it, I am still floored by how our world had changed by this epidemic! 
I never really knew of Matthew Modine until I saw this movie. He was very good in the part and I have watched the movie several times. I also purchased the book as well. 
If you are not familiar with research, this nice approach to a scientist's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies. Besides, this very interesting and moving film, with high level and homogeneous performances, will show, the closest it can, the early facts about such a terrible disease. I strongly recommend it. I have seen it with my 16 year old son, but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age. A bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience. 
The film is well-done in all aspects, definitely worth seeing if you have any interest in the way the world began to track the AIDS epidemic back around 1980. I was a newspaper editor in Oklahoma at the time, and I remember the early news stories which first hinted that something big and bad was brewing in the gay community. Although I am straight, I have friends of that sexual preference, and in fact, one of my sister's oldest and dearest friends was an early casualty of this killer disease. Even better than this movie, however, is the source book by the late Randy Shilts, who was a journalist in San Francisco (who happened to be gay, and who happened to contract and die of AIDS eventually.) The non-fiction book is huge, but it is gripping. AIDS is still with us, and is a heterosexual scourge in Africa, so this story is not as dated as one might think. 
I received this product on time and in perfect shape. I enjoy the high quality of Amazon's site 
This movie was excellent. I have a degree in public health so this was a smash hit to me. You can gain appreciation for it on many levels. I found the investigating of HIV and the disease course tracking to be interesting. Anyone interested in politics or history would love this movie. Anyone who has been touched by AIDS/HIV themselves or in knowing someone who suffered from the disease will gain knowledge and insight from this. Anyone who is interested in government scandals or foreign relations would be drawn to the story. And mostly, anyone who can appreciate human interaction and flaws and how our sexuality is tied or not tied to our identity would glean a lot from this. The message and information is so powerful. Of course as anything brought to tv there may be slight exaggerations to the story but for the most part it accurately chronicles the struggles both political and scientific that plagued the on-set on AIDS/HIV disease spread. The same frustrations can speak for many issues and so this is not only a piece dealing with the hard topic of AIDS but, since science doesnt often make it into Hollywood, it is representative of many struggles. Matthew Modine and Lily Tomlin are wonderful 
It's been 25 years and so much in the gay community has changed and so much hasn't. A quarter century ago it seemed unthinkable that Love and Death could ever co-exist. Now we live in the midst of an uneasy truce. See this film and see how the first generation dealt with the unthinkable 
I really liked this DVD. Hard as it was to watch for all the painful memories it brings flooding back into the forefront of the consciousness. The callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness of the Reagan Administration as those it considered lesser Americans lay in hospitals suffering and dying. This DVD shows Dr Gallo as a shallow man with a vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin to human compassion unless of course the camera's were rolling. The film shows the CDC being headed by political hacks who elevated the collected arts of administrative spin control, reckless indifference to suffering \ death of people it did not like and stonewalling to the stuff of mythic legend. While the DVD shows the ugliest demons of the human heart laid bare that the whole world might see it also shares the most humane and tender moments of the early days of before HIV / AIDS got those names. The film showed how even in one of america's darkest hours when true presidental leadership was asleep at the switch, the little people those deep inside government did all they could to protect the public health living up to the highest standards for onr called to offer themselves in service to our nation. The DVD simply told the truth and it is left pretty much to the viewer to make up his or her own mind what they think of those times. There were some moving facts at the end of the DVD all now quite dated. I guess the thing that caught me so totally off guard was the running tally showing the numbers of sick and dying people from the earliest days of the epidemic. It is so sad how the Reagan adminstration so viciously sat on its hands doing nothing while so many died in an epidemic that it might not have stopped but it might have slowed significantly had it only acted with the same fortitude at home that it mustered in Beruit or Libia. Yes I dwell too much on the sickening aspects of those times because just seeing it again after having lived through it makes me mad. Seeing this DVD just convinces me that had we a real leader in the white house when AIDS HIV GRID Gay Cancer first burst onto the scene things might have not been so grim. But this DVD is so much more than the venom and pain of loss it also highlights human kind at its best. There is much love in this DVD balanced with the grim realities of the day. Back in the day I can not say I was on the front lines, because indeed I was not. I think this movie is a must have for anyone's collection and at its current price it can not be beat. Of course I brought a copy and might buy another for a spare to lend out for teaching purposes. This DVD is pretty accurate HIV history as it should be told 
One of the best films, adapted from a book. very touching true story, and the acting impecable, Richard Gere gives a great performance as a man confronting his mortality 
This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. "Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given "evil empire" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them? Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, "McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!") The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run. What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur 
Nothing can be better than "The Firm" written by John Grisham, who himself is a lawyer. The attentions to details that Grisham manages to pull are just fantastic. I read the book before watching the movie, and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book, as the book gets slow in between, but not the movie. Cruise's is superb, so are the other actors in this movie. I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences. 
The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie. Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life. At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham. The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into. Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes. Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain 
This is a smartly written and fast-paced drama. Tom Cruise plays a sharp young Harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob. Great supporting help from Gene Hackman and Wilford Brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors. 
The Firm, it`s a great story, and an amazing movie. i`v read the story, and just now, i watched the movie. it`s great to read the story and then watch its movie, you`ll be able to see what you imagined while reading the book! i recomend the firm to all! and if you can get the book and read it first, it`ll be more fun! Trust me! Enjoy 
I hate lawyers. What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!" Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW? What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of court. Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks. Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed. JS 
The DvD is great and so was the price. The movie is EXCELLENT!!! Can't stop watching it! 
I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice. It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out. The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie. Everyone else does a great job of acting here. To me though, Tom is miscasted. He seems to be out of place. His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do. Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned. Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well. A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here 
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes. It gets stuck or restarts itself. Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think. Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for "enjoyment." That being said, I love this movie, and here's why. 1. It's a true story. 2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the "wrong" country. How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country? This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian. If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time 
IN A NUTSHELL: UNDERRATED - UNDERVALUED - UNDEREXPOSED - Excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event! It is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are ideally suited as Soviet naval Captains, and as believable as their rebuilt authentic K-19! Kathryn Bigelow who Directed and Produced the film did an incredible job, which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the DVD. BOTTOM LINE: THIS NEW KIND OF SUB FILM IS A PART OF HISTORY If you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best. If you enjoy thrillers, this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone. 
For those who don't know russian the title of this was (Просмотрение K-19 - Review of K-19, thought I'd be funny there) This movie is not so much a combat movie it's a what happened movie. The flagship of the Russian Navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 Captians, yea that kinda don't go over so well. They have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys. It is quite a gripping movie though. This is also one that needs to be bought not just rented 
This was a true story and a scary part of our history. The book comes to life in the movie... I pictured another person as the captain of the Sub... Mr. Ford did a good job acting the part 
I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice 
There are so much information about this movie in Amazon.com description and other reviews so I don't want to repeat them. The only problem in this movie was Harisson Ford's style, he was acting more American than Russian and for moments you may feel that K-19 is an American submarine and Harisson Ford is an American Captain. He was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts, he couldn't deny his American Friquent Style! I think Harrison Ford for this movie was not a wise Decision. I know, starring First class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie 
K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense. Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men. Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571". The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
I hadn't heard about this movie before, until I came across the influences for the Silent Hill videogames. The Changeling was one of them, as well as other movies, books and TV shows. The movie has it's strong point in the story and the time the movie takes to "explain" the situations and the people. It's not just scares, it is more of a suspense thriller than a haunted house movie. It has good enough plot twists to make it more interesting than most "scary" movies. The comparison to The Shining is unavoidable, but no because of the type of story but because of the great delivery and overall quality of the two movies. A definite must-see, and an ovelooked classic 
A music professor moves into a lonely old Victorian mansion in order to put his life back together following the death of his family. In what seems like the ideal setting for rest, relaxation, and a place to concentrate on his music, soon turns into a setting for disturbing sounds, voices, and eerie images. Just what is contained in this house, and what does it want? The usual outstanding performance from George C. Scott, as well as top-notch writing and directing, contribute to the power of this quiet, spooky chiller. Highly recommended. 
One of the supposed reasons why ghosts remain in this world is that they were murdered, and want the world to know who did it. So expect a lot of that in "The Changeling," a quiet, compelling ghost story that harkens back to old-fashioned chillers. No ghouls, buckets of blood, chainsaws or serial killers. Instead, this movie relies on outstanding acting, and a timeless feeling that permeates the simple story. And it'll scare the skin off you. John Russell (George C. Scott) is on a trip with his wife and daughter, when a freak car accident kills them both. Months later, the grieving composer moves to Seattle and rents an enormous historical house, trying to bury himself in his new job. But there are odd sounds and sights in his house -- faucets running, eerie voices the piano clashing, and a boy drowned in the tub. John becomes increasingly desperate to find out the truth, assisted by the real estate agent who got him the house (Trish Van Devere). With seances, visions and a well under the floorboards, he begins to piece together a terrible crime from many years ago -- and the "changeling" that the ghost wants revenge on. Anyone who wants blood, special effects and lots of screaming had better look elsewhere for their horror kicks. "The Changeling" is a very different kind of movie -- think Shirley Jackson, not Stephen King -- where a wheelchair rattling down the stairs is enough to make your hair stand on end. (And do I detect some influence on "The Ring" in certain scenes?) This movie also feels elegant and timeless. Old mossy mansions, horseback riding in damp forests, and a composer trying to overcome his grief. Peter Medak drapes the movie in beautiful visuals, and allows the viewers to get to know the characters before the plot really gets moving. Then "The Changeling" becomes creepy very fast. The plot grows more suspenseful with every scene, building with every new discovery -- a wheelchair, a baptismal medal, and a bathtub -- until something has to erupt. The ghost never appears except in flashbacks -- an appalling murder scene -- but his keening voice can be heard over and over. George C. Scott gives a pitch-perfect performance as the mild, slightly reclusive John, who is still suffering from his losses and trying to move on with his life. Van Devere comes across as a bit annoying at first, but she also serves as a good counterpoint to Scott, as well as a potential love interest whenever he's ready. Melvyn Douglas also has a good brief role as a politician with a deep dark secret. Less is more in "The Changeling," a movie whose scares spring from its exceptional scripting, eerie ghost and great acting. Just don't watch this one alone in the house... at night 
"The Changeling" is more mystery than horror film, which is not what I had expected prior to viewing. Nonetheless, this is a good film and I would recommend it. George C. Scott plays John Russell, a classical music composer who loses his wife and daughter in an accident. In an effort to forget this tragedy, he leaves New York City for Seattle. Desiring seclusion in order to practice his compositions, he moves alone into a large, vacant house. It is here that someone, or some thing, begins to contact him. Russell, perhaps realizing he has nothing left to lose, attempts to determine the reason for this. To reveal what or who the Changeling is would be to reveal too much about the movie, so I won't do that here. Unlike some other haunted house films, the ending to this one is moderately satisfactory. The story is told with class, as one would hope for a movie with a classical music composer as it central character. There are no cheap scares, exploitive material such as nudity or gore, and scarcely any bad language. In fact, I'm not really certain why it was rated R and most definitely a re-rating would earn this a PG-13 today. The acting, score and direction are all first rate. I didn't find the movie very scary; however, the suspenseful moments were done well and were fairly effective. The DVD has no extras, though the picture and sound are good. This is worth at least one watch and the price is certainly right. 
First of all, I have lost count of the ammount of times I have seen this movie but every time I watch it I get goose bumps. This is how affective the movie is. George C. Scott (of "Patton" fame) plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy. Soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and Mr. Scott begins to investige the house's history. This is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film. This movie is all about atmosphere. There are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays. This film does not need to gross the viewer out. The Changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters. You are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease. There is nothing "in your face" about the scares. This film is for fans of the 1960's film "The Haunting" or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story. Don't even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and I guarantee you'll watch it more than once. I have recommended it to many people and I never heard a negative comment. For the full effect, wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone. See how many times you glance over your shoulder. 
Very good and scary movie. Saw years ago on video, DVD makes it so much better. Some say it's better watching it for a second time-you may miss some key facts the first time around. One of my favorites! Highly recommended 
Simply put, most horror films don't age well at all. When I use the term "horror" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which "the changeling" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time. The changeling doesn't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story. A strong script, excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers (Hitchcock) or modern horror films in the mold of "the sixth sense". If you're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you'll need to look elsewhere (thankfully). This film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills. For those who don't prefer to watch R-rated films I can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge, has very little violence, no nudity, and certainly nothing that can be considered "graphic" by todays standards. Most modern films rated PG-13 have more disturbing content than this film. If you're an adult viewer looking for suspense and thrills but you want to avoid gore and graphic violence.... the changeling is a good choice! Not a perfect film, but an excellent effort that holds up well. -J 
I love scary, haunted house flicks. What I don't like are cheesy monsters, buckets of blood (The Shining excepted), computer effects, etc. The Changeling is one of the best. George C Scott is a man who lost his wife and daughter in an accident. He buys a huge house, and very creepy things start to happen. He finds himself in a turn of the century mystery involving people in power. I don't know what scared me more, that moaning, the awful wheelchair, or the apparition in the well! If you like good chillers without all the computer animation, naked chicks, and blood, buy this 
Very good film with a great cast. Reese and Wahlberg are wonderful in their roles and play them to perfection, Walhberg especially. Very much worth watching/owning 
What a cast! Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William L. Petersen, Amy Brenneman and Alyssa Milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl (Witherspoon) and her seemingly perfect boyfriend (Wahlberg). Of course, the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker. Wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance. William Petersen (CSI) is outstanding as the Witherspoon's concerned father who has way too many issues himself. This film is a hidden gem. Buy it . . . you will not be disappointed 
ALyssa Milano is HOT , HOT , HOT. I like this movie, it is like a reverse teen version of Fatal Attraction. Made after The Crush and before SwimFan, fell right in between and much better film than both, much more suspenseful and better actors at that 
Was this crazy or what Mark did a very unbelievable job and he play that roll right down to the T..very scarey i haven't been in a releationship like that but for those who are i hope they get out of it ok. 
Even though this film might be categorized as a guilty pleasure, it still contains excellent early performances by Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and a maturing Alyssa Milano. Production value is high, so this is definitely not a B-movie. The well-developed plot is a familiar one - good girl meets great guy who ends up being a psycho. But the lack of originality doesn't take away from the interesting progression of the movie. Directing, editing, writing and acting are still top notch. And, even though Wahlberg's character ends up going off the deep end, he portrays a believable 'normal' guy in the beginning, even providing an intense roller coaster service early in the movie. He made a pretty good psycho, as well. I enjoyed the film and would even watch it again. 
This is hardly a new story, but it still effectively told under the grunge setting of the time and the somewhat hoaky lines that Mark Wahlberg says. (And that scene on the roller coaster, I don't care who you are it's not happening that way.) Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a sweet faced 16 year old freshly transported from Seattle to live with her father and step mother. Still somewhat neive and overly friendly with all she meets, she meets a handsome stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg). At first all seems well, as he wins over her parents and they are enjoying the bloom of new love. But David has a dark side, whose jealous nature emerges slowly but surely. Eventually he shows that he doesn't just have a dark side, but is outright dangerous. Lies about the past, violence, and the inevitable ending in a blaze of glory violence take place. This is a movie all girls should watch, it teaches us all about the bad boys. A part of us is drawn to the bad boy, whose dangerous and somewhat psychotic side appeals to girls. Why? Because we girls want to be bad ourselves and we are trying to live it through the bad boy. Reese Whiterspoon's friend played by Alyssa Milano is the more obvious example. She picks up the ugliest, greasiest man in the room, praces around in her hootchie mama outfits because he wants her to, and allows herself to be used and abused until it's too late. Fortunately for Reese, her sexuality is kept under under more modest wraps. Of course, we must learn these lessons by doing no matter what your friends, family or even the movies can tell you. Eventually we can see through these thin venirs and get past it. If you want to be a bad girl, be one on your own time. The bad boys of this world are lots of fun, most are tornados in the sack, but cheat left and right, wrap chairs around heads, and will call and ask for bail money. Sell crazy and codependent someplace else. 
This is a great movie and one of my favorites. I watched this movie back in 2002 and bought it a couple of months ago when I saw it at Wal-Mart. The acting is great-- Reese Witherspoon Mark Walhberg. Highly recommended. 
What makes such an impact here is that it's not that far fetched. My ex-brother-in-law was just like Mark Wahlbergs charactor. He was abusive and manipulitive and downright aggresive, overly protective/controling and jealous beyond no end. That to me is what makes this movie so scary (not really scary but intence)...it's very close to home and very real. This could happen, this does happen because there are people that are really like this. Mark Wahlberg plays the perfect psycho, all sweet on the outside but you can see through it. That was my brother-in-law. You almost wonder why they bother to pretend because it's so obvious you can see through the fasade. Too bad Reese couldn't (then again neither could me sister)...Teenage girls beware...just because he says nice things to you and you lost your virginity to him doesn't mean you should forgive him when he punches your friend in the face and tries to kill you family. Very well acted on all fronts with a tightly wound believable script. Recomended 
This movie is crazy good. Marky Mark plays such an excellent psycho and Reese Whitherspoon does a great job of playing the innocent/rebel teen. The suspense keeps building and building in this thriller for a dramatic ending. An excellent movie and an excellent movie to own 
This movie is great. I just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it. I throughly enjoyed it entirely, I believe it kind of relates to Fatal Attraction 
This was a great show. I can't say anything better than the other reviewers, so I'll just say that this tape is a low-cost alternative to the DVDs that were released if you just want a little of the show for nostalgic purposes 
School House Rock is mad awesome cool! I love all the song, like i'm just a bill. i memorized the preamble cause of the preamble song thing. peac 
Back in 1988 when I was in college we all sat in dining hall one night and sang the School House Rock songs to each other. There, in our twenties, all of us could well remember the music and lyrics. Taking these songs off the air was the worst decision for Saturday morning cartoons ever made. They are fun, educational, memorable, instructive and their goal is not to get a parent to buy something (well, that explains why they are no longer on the air regularly). I loved them as a 5, 6, 7 year old and have never stopped (along with the majority of my generation). In fact, when I sat through my law school class about how a bill becomes a law I could not get the "I am a Bill" song out of my head and every time I hear someone describe a verb without using an adverb I have to wonder, did they ever see Lolly 
The American Revolution is an important event that students learn in Social Studies class. "NO More Kings" is a cartoon discussing events from the American Revolutionary War. This cartoon was wicked awesome. Most of the information was correct. Only a little part of the lyrics were inaccurate. There were a lot of key events that were left out such as, the Stamp and Townsend acts. Also, the harsh winter the colonists had with the Indians and Squanto were left out. The illustrations of the cartoon were a great way to show what life was like back in the1770's. To improve this cartoon, fix the inaccurate information and missing events. This cartoon is for a 5th grade age level. Overall "No more kings" had its highs and lows 
In this scary movie. Mark's mum dies when he is about 10 years old and he goes to stay with his uncle, aunt and cousins for a fortnight while his dad goes on a business trip. He is also under psychiatric treatment because of the trauma of his mother's death. Mark innocently gets involved in Henry's evil plans to kill and maim for fun!! Henry gives the impression of being a little angel to his parents and uncle and only shows his darker side to Mark. He even tries to convince everyone that his evil ideas have come from Mark because of the traumatic loss of his mum. Mark fails to convince his father, his uncle, his aunt or his psychiatrist of the evil doings of Henry right up to the end of the film. I won't spoil it for you by telling you the outcome. A very enjoyable film that had me on the edge of my seat almost all through 
this must have seemed like a great idea at the time,"cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor". the problem is his range is all the way from a to b. this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many "chance" happenings. in the end all we get is this "thriller"(and i use the term very loosely)that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling 
This film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it. The plot is not very intriguing, and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life, so it lacks this sense of reality. A dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer, which is exactly the point of this movie. However, this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end, and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute. Elijah Wood is stunning, only due to his efforts can the film get some believability. Caulkin is perfect in this role too, portraying the bad boy, I have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor. Maybe only comparing to Elijah, but hey, he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever, so no wonder you cannot compete with him... Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for Elijah Wood fans! 
Culkin(henry) does a good job portraying a scary lunatic, because he gives off a spooky air. His acting, however is very dull, and takes away from the movie. HOWEVER, Culkins dry (but convinving) performance is completely compensated for with the performance of Elijah Wood (Mark). Not only is mark the most adorable, loveable child, but his performance is jaw-dropping. The spotlight for this movie really belongs to Wood. He acts every scene out with the utmost emotion, and passion. He makes this movie one of the best. It is the battle between good (Mark) and evil (Henry). Henry plays a lunatic son, who does awful things to his family and others. Mark comes to live with Henry and his family for a while after his mom dies. Henry is Mark's cousin (too bad for Mark). Mark can see the evil lurking within henry, but can he prove it to his aunt and uncle(henry's parents) before it is too late? 
Two great child stars blended together into one suspense movie. Although, you don't really get the feel of suspense because of the peaceful and flowing music, the message behind the plot would really give you the chills. Elijah Wood acted out every expression he had to act out fully with his face. You could really see the fear in his eyes when he realizes Henry(Macaulay Culkin) is planning to hurt someone. The story begins with a vast highland then starts off with Mark (Elijah) playing soccer with his friends. Then, out of the blue, his dad appears and we are brought to a hospital scene where Mark sits beside his mother's deathbed. He promises her that she won't die. Unfortunately, she does and Mark is full of sadness at her funeral. His dad has to go to a business trip to Japan for 2 weeks leaving him behind with Henry's family. At first, he gets along well with Henry but soon finds out his evil schemes. Henry always gets away with all his schemes with his angelic smile. I thought Elijah was great, as he always is in all his movies. Though he was only a kid back then, he acted from his heart. As for Macaulay, I thought he really showed a sense of madness and jealousy but lost expression at times. He was great at expressing silent anger and suspense. He showed that he was fully in the dark side. Although he had little changes in facial expressions and reactions from that of 'Home Alone', I still have to give him credit for acting such a difficult role. If you've never been on stage or films before, you'd never know how hard it is to act as a villain than a hero. Some scenes really impressed me especially the cliff scene. It's amazing how the production managed to shoot that part without any visual effects especially with two young lads. All in all, I thought the movie was entertaining. I was impressed at how 12-year-olds could do really well at their age. I'm already 15 and have experienced acting on stage and you all must know. It's not easy. Before critizing their acting, you have to think that they're only kids and I have to say, they were very professional. If you like movies with suspense and drama, you'd better watch this. Along with these two very expressive actors. Highly recommended 
{spoilers}: "If I let you go...do you think you could fly?" This is what I think is a special quote when I watched the theatrical trailer on my DVD of "The Good Son" and it is a very interesting opposite turn in Macaulay Culkin's career from the "Home Alone" movies to this where he plays a murderer named Henry. This is really worth watching if you've never seen it and if you like thrillers. Mark Evans {Elijah Wood} goes to live with his aunt and uncle and his cousin Henry after his mother dies and his father goes away on a business trip. When Mark first meets Henry, they are great friends. Their friendship goes too far when Henry soon becomes evil and Mark is the only one who sees the truth about his cousin after he kills a dog with a crossbow and Henry wants Mark to have fun in his own way when Henry throws his dummy Mr. Highway onto a crowded highway and causes a pileup, and while Henry tries to kill his sister several times. Later on, Mark keeps trying to convince Henry's mother Susan {Wendy Crewson} that Henry is murderous and she doesn't believe him, so Mark is left to confront Henry before anything worse can happen. I usually don't watch thrillers, but this is cool. I thought it was worth seeing to see Macaulay Culkin's psychotic acting and it is worth about 4 and a half stars because it starts out a little slow, but when Henry's friendly behavior changes, it's worth all the rest that it's worth. 
After the death of his mother, Elijah Wood is left with his uncle's family while dad David Morse takes off for two weeks to settle their future. Uncle has two children: a little girl and an older boy Wood's age: Macaulay Culkin. Behind Culkin's angelic visage, naturally, lurks the soul of a devil. Wood suspects the evil, but no one will believe him, and so he is left alone to try to stop the increasingly deadly games his cousin is playing. Director Joseph P. Ruben made something of a career of telling tales of domestic horror, what with this, The Stepfather and Sleeping with the Enemy. He claims, in the featurette, to want to reverse our expectations about Culkin's character, which is, of course, nonsense: we know going in that he's bad. And familiar as Evil Child territory is (think The Bad Seed, The Other, The Omen, etc., etc., etc.), this is still an effective example of the genre, benefiting from an admirably economical narrative. The menu is basic, as are the extras: the theatrical trailer, and the usual featurette. Nuthin' special. Very much a catalogue-filler release, with no real value-added on this disc. Sound and picture are acceptable, and the movie is a decent 86 minutes 
"Mad scientist" Dr. Edward Pretorius has created a resonator machine which can reveal a parralel dimension by stimulating the pineal gland in the brain which perceives the lurkers beyond who lie in wait. Parasitic creatures swim through the ether attracted by movement and light. It is claimed that the pineal gland in the cerebrum is responsible for sixth sense function, and is essentially the parapsychological bit of grey matter. When Dr. Katheryn McMichaels discovers Pretorius' assistant Crawford Tillinghast who was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, incarcerated in a mental hospital, she remands him into her custody to recreate the experiment. Together with cop Buford 'Bubba' Brownlee, the dimension is opened and they are greeted by a nude and subsequently malformed Dr. Pretorius who takes a strong liking to Katherine - both to her horror and ecstasy, for it seems the process also enhances sexual sensitivity as well, and she is awakened to her primal self. Considering the procedure is largely experimental yet, the scientific method of trial and error is employed to disasterous results, as various creatures who range from eel-like beings to huge worm-like monsters are attracted to the massive electro-magnetic vibrations, and eventually overcome the participants. Pretorius is himself a transmutating beast who attempts to absorb Tillinghast and Katherine, until they eventually barely escape with their lives, though Tillinghast is dramatically effected by this encounter as his pineal stem emerges from his forehead like a "third eye", through which his psychic abilities are amplified, but is also afflicted with an insatiable hunger for brains. Despite becoming a patient herself scheduled for shock therapy at the hands of a sadistic and resentful rival doctor, Katheryn escapes and returns to the attic of the blighted house to destroy the resonator, but is surprisingly met by Tillinghast who restrains her. He struggles to regain control of his mind, but is eventually ingested by Pretorius, creating a hellish struggle from within the bowels of the creature. She barely emerges from the nightmare with her life, but at the cost of her own sanity. For those who enjoy the writings of Lovecraft, From Beyond is both a psychological and horror thriller filled with impressive pyrotechnics and FX creations 
One of my favorite Hor-no films. Barbara Crampton is awesome in that leather getup she wears. "It's so beautiful"....This has to be released on DVD. 
I love this movie. It's probably one of my favourite Jeffrey Combs films after the "Re-Animator" series. My dream would be for it to FINALLY come to special edition widescreen DVD with commentary by Combs, Stuart Gordon, and Barbara Crampton at least, as their comments on the "Re-Animator" special edition are absolutely incredible and hilarious. A possible behind the scenes/deleted/extended scenes would make my day as well. The film is just good fun. Great story, great actors, great gore. : 
I saw this years ago, and it was one of the nastiest, scariest, horrifying pieces of cinema I have ever witnessed. I absolutely respect Stuart Gordon who also did Dolls and The Reanimater, for their time so original and still great fun to watch. I am still waiting for it to be put on DVD format, then I'll be buying it 
I loved this movie as a rental growing up, and now I own it along with every Lovecraft adaption ever made. I also have a poster of this in my bedroom (Humans are Such Easy Prey...ha). A scientist invents a machine that holds hideous monsters that try and possess this guy. The chick in this movie is pretty. This is super gory. Stuart Gordon is the king of Lovecraft adaptions and is still going strong into the new millenium with Dagon 
Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working. Any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film--they may or may not like it, but that's not what matters. This film is amazing 
Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring. It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally. I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me. I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better. My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing. Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
A little Cerebral and a little slapstick, and all Shakespeare. It is how Shakespeare would have written the story of Hamlets friends 
This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something. But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time. There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) writing imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
I have to admit this movie can be slow and strange. Hence minus 1 star. But TO ME, and this is just to ME, I was able to pay attention because of Gary Oldman, who is my all time #1 favorite actor. He's such a chameleon, and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way, shape, or form (or is just eccentric or crazy lol), he's just brilliantly funny in this. It's interesting b/c Gary's character as 'Rosencrantz' (NOT Guildenstern lol) is a 'slow' fella but he's imaginative inventive, but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you're talking about. Then to top it all off, you're thrust into HAMLET, but from another perspective. So you gotta get into the Shakespearian linguo, which I haven't done fully since 12th grade, and that was 6 years ago. Fortunately, Ros Guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or AS THICKLY as the other regular HAMLET characters do. It's just worded strangely b/c it's like they're poets. The chemistry between Roth Oldman is wonderful, and the extra's are interviews with Dreyfus, Oldman, Roth, Stoppard himself. Then they also have a photo gallery. That's it, but for me it was enough to hear Oldman talk for 58 minutes! :) (They're interviewed separately.) The dvd I got came with 2 discs, I suppose this is the only release to DVD so far so they all will be 2 disc? Quality was very good. :) If you're a big fan of Gary's, I HIGHLY recommend this flick. Very amusing, and interesting, and good Shakespearian fun : 
This is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone. This wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare's HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet's melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince. In this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps. It helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style. It helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier. It is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn. It's is fun. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of Shakespeares works. It does help to have an idea of Hamlet, and I would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost. It gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of Hamlet. 
Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
But I'm a Cheerleader~ Natasha Lyonne is a good movie that could have been so much better. Natasha Lyonne is perfect in the role as Megan. Megan is a cheerleader, has a boyfriend but she does not like to kiss him, has girls in her locker and thinks of girls all the time. Her "friends" and family decide that it is time for an intervention and send her away to a camp to turn her straight. The music is pretty awful and most of the lyrics seem to have been written in five minutes or by a high school rock band. I truly is the music that prevents me from giving this movie a 5 out of 5. The script is well written with well developed characters and a plot that is truly outstanding. The dialog is a hoot and there are many witty and good one liners. This is one good movie that could have easily attained 5 stars with the right soundtrack but as it is I give it 4 out of 5 stars. 
I have seen the other reviews and agree with them in the main. This movie is absolutely worth the cost. When you have read and know the incredible pain visited on children by institutions like this, it is good to be told in a humorous way of the pain visited upon these children. It is definitely worth seeing especially after reading about these torture camps. If it evens open the eyes of one parent or caregiver, it will have been worth it. As satire and humor alone, it is admirably worth it 
This movie, I have seen back when it came out, and I loved it! I watched in alomost everyday, and vnever got tired of it! I saw it again and loved it like the first time I watched it. Light, and cute! Keeps my mind happy, and entertained! I definetly suggest anyone to watch this movie. Especially if you feel misunderstood or out of place, this movie will pick you up, and show you that you are not alone. Greta sattire 
This underrated, highly entertaining satire boasts memorable performances, clever camera angles and a spirited production design. Look for a red-headed, scene-stealing Douglas Spain (Walkout, Band of Brothers, Resurrection Blvd) as one of gone-with-the-gays True Directions' "misfits." His climactic tearful speech is both touching and hilarious. Pop the corn, kick back and treat yourself to this delightful romp 
When I was looking at this movie from the gay and lesbian list of films on border I didn't really think I would like it since I'm a gay male and couldn't possibly like anything that had to do with lesbians. Let me tell you I was wrong. I feel ashamed to even say that I couldn't like this movie. Let me explain the movie to you and you see if you wouldn't like it. We start off with Natasha Lyonn playing the character Megan Bloomfield. A cheerleader who is popular, kind, and the girlfriend of the star quaterback in highschool. We see that she doesn't really like to kiss her boyfriend and her family at dinner prays to make things just the way god intended them to be. After school her family, some of her friends and her boyfriend meet her at her house for an intervention. They claim that they fear she is a lesbian. Proving it with evidence of girls picture in her locker, gay memoribilia in her room, she's a vegetarian and the biggest one of all that she doesn't like to kiss her boyfriend. After that she is taken to a sexual redirection camp run by Mary J. Brown played by Cathy Moriarty with her staff RuPaul playing the character Mike who is an Ex gay and her son Rock played by Eddie Cibrian who isnt so manly himself. Where queer boys learn how to be men and Dikey girls learn how to become happy homemakers. (sorry for the rude example). This is where she meets Clea DuVall playing the character Graham Eaton. Seeming like the tough lesbian girl who will never surrender herself to the school. Unfortunately Graham has problems of her own when we discover that she will not be aloud back home, no car and no trust fund if she does not succeed this task. The girls ultimately become friends and attracted to each other. They even have a kiss session when they are rescued from Richard Molls character Larry Morgan-Gordon and his lover Wesley Manns character Lloyd Morgan-Gordon. The training sessions are funny to watch especially with the men. I don't want to ruin any more of the movie for you. If you haven't seen this then you should. I hope this review will get you to watch it 
It's actually not just a light-hearted silly comedy-- as my ex pointed out to me "Did you ever notice how only the gay characters wear any color?" Everything is brown and drab green but the clothes and surroundings of the queer characters 
This is funniest and light-hearted comdey that is not overly cheesy or degrading. Its cute, charming and watchable. Just a typical love story that involves gay and lesbian charachters. Nothing too serious is laid out, but it doesnt take away from the film. One of the sincerist gay comedies ever made 
my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl's moving castle. it has the same kind of story and if you like how�'s moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too 
My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital. The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum. Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind. This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required. My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2. (Causing them to buy a number of other Ghibli films) Highly recommended 
Family movies don't get much better than this. No double-entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable. Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch. There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good "friendly spirit" movie. Kids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie. Adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with (and get a chuckle out of) several conversations between parents and their children. This is one of those movies from which you will get the "warm fuzzies." Share it with others in your family 
A good animated film, with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations. It also protrays children's ready acceptance of unusual or supernatural. The father's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming 
My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she's only one year old. Not to mention that my husband and I saw the movie first and decided we had to buy it for her. We have watched and enjoyed it many times. 
The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off! I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please! 
My wife, 4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me. He said it was a great family movie. It didn't sound that interesting so I didn't purchase it right away. Finally, one day when I saw a link about it on Amazon, I decided to go for it. We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it. We have since collected 5 of Miazaki, and Studio Ghibli's films, and we plan to purchase more in the future. BTW, if you like this, also check out "Wisper of the Heart", another great Studio Ghibli film. Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie 
This is an excellent movie for all ages! Get it now. Experience the magic. Wonderful story, acting, and attitude sets this movie from all others 
My Neighbor Totoro is a simply wonderful story. It portrays innocence and family love at its best and is very delightful to watch. 
My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss. Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD. Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion. Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it. One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld. The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it. According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history. So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge. On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease." Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software. "Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES. This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes). So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect. Even the bad guys seem familiar. Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer. They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl. Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree. The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner. A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development. I am normally opposed to remakes. For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films. The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake. But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original. The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life. As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive. For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs. The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects. The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle. My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum. All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film. It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation: JURASSAIC PARK. Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks. Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie. 
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie 
A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood. Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World. Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale. Seriously, why is somebody not making this already 
I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night. She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film. One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene. I like chase scenes. Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection. A few good comic shots. Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break. 
I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!  
It was a great movie. If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there. I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real. It was a movie worth buying 
In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them. Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land". The DVD has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi. Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall 
Imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months. What would you do? What would you decide mattered to you? What would you think you had accomplished? What would you consider left unaccomplished? What would you want your legacy to be? Those are the questions facing the centeral character in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (meaning "To live"). The brilliant actor Takashi Shimura plays the role of Kanji Watanabe, a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little. One day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die. This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile. He tries to "live it up" with newfound friends and loose women, but this does not fulfill him. He cannot bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate; caught up in their own petty problems, they seem to have little time for the old man. Eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit, another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful. But even she cannot help this poor man who needs love, fulfillment, a sense of purpose. And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward. After he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who, while previously fighting him every step of the way, now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory, paying him much lip service while denying him true honor. Normally I don't give so detailed a plot description, but I've done so here for two reasons: 1) few people, particularly in America, have seen or even heard of this movie, and 2) I want to point out how universal the themes are, how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast. While watching Ikiru I kept thinking a good modern title might be, "The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same." Like so many Kurosawa films, this movie, though black and white and old, feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content. While much has been made of Kurosawa's concern with the Japanese conflict between collective and individual, the issues in Ikiru resonates with any culture, not just Japan's. These bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar. This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle. It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life. At the same time, it never feels pretentious or preachy. The story is complex, not in terms of plot twists, but in terms of its "inner life." Yet with a running time of two hours and 23 minutes, Ikiru moves very quickly, feeling faster than a typical 90-minute Hollywood film. This is probably because there is lots of ground to cover, and also because of the effortless acting. Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema. Though Shimura is not widely known in the west, he was one of Japan's major actors of the 1950s and 60s, and Kurosawa worked with him often. See him in Kurosawa's Seven Samuri, made just two years after this film, for a completely different performance, one of swagger and bravado. Other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker. She too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher, but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves. On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is "The Mummy." Rather than be offended, he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed. It's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this. Yet the film, or the third act of it, also reminded me of a very different motion picture--Citizen Kane, believe it or not. While stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common, both deal with a man, recently dead, who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially. They try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture, while we, as the omniscent audience, do. They misunderstand his actions, and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite. (Often with Kane the reverse is true.) The only difference is while Watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character, Kane is not. Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces. Ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or "Mr. K," as he was called by many). Katayama was the head of Nissan Motor's West Coast division in North America in the 1960s and 70s. He was brought to the task when Nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence, especially in North America, which was then ruled by big, powerful Ford and GM cars. Though Katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death, he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in America, which he did through steady, unflagging determination. But he also went against the grain of Japanese business protocol, and encountered the wrath of his superiors in Tokyo. Ironically, the more successful he became, the more he was resented. (His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.) After establishing Nissan as a major player in America, Katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work. He died in obscurity, but today Mr. K is a revered figure at Nissan, and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago. Executives now dislocate their jaws praising him. It all sounds too familiar. The second DVD has two features, a 90 minute documentary from Kurosawa's own production company about his working methods, wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product; and a 40-minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews. Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them. There's also the film's trailer and a commentary track which I confess I haven't had time to listen to. It's by Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa. Criterion once again is the standard to which all DVD makers should be aspiring. The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see. It's unfortunate that for many years Kurosawa's work was not better taken care of. Like Nissan's Mr. K, he was without honor in his own country, because he was considered "too Western" in his outlook. Like Mr. K, his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland. Fortunately, the work of this "Mr. K" is finally being preserved. Ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you've never seen a Japanese movie before, even if you've never heard of Akira Kurosawa, even if you "hate" foreign or black and white films, even if you think you have no interest in the subject. Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story. Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term "timeless classic. 
Akira Kurosawa made Rashomon in 1950, Ikiru in 1952 and The Seven Samurai in 1954. All these films have quite a complex structure. Yet Ikiru remains a very simple film, which says nothing original: it's not what is shown, but how, that is important, as in Flaubert's story "A Simple Heart". It will be appreciated best by those who've realised they're going to die (you'll know what I mean). Watching Ozu's Tokyo Story beforehand will prepare you for the subtle style. In Ikiru five themes are interwoven: 1. Learning to accept death At the start of the film Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) learns he has stomach cancer and has six months to live. He has retreated into his work after his wife's early death and become devoted to routine. The camera shows us several shots in closeup of Shimura's face after he speaks to his doctor, and we see the anguish in his eyes. It's not fear he shows: it's horror, horror of what his life has become. The shock of his wife's death has caused him to stop living. The shock of his own coming death makes him realise he must start to live: only then will he be ready to die. There is a contrast in the documentary style depiction of the hospital scenes and Watanabe's office compared with the closeups of Shimura, hunched up with horrified realisation or showing eyes that are black pools of despair. This is the hardest thing to do in any art form: this is simplicity, and the effect is overwhelming, the acting superb. 2. Placing value in your life Watanabe has not much expertise in how to live. His son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko) and daughter-in-law Kazue (Kyoko Seki) share his home but not much else. Watanabe cannot speak to them about his cancer. Cast out on his own resources, Watanabe tells a complete stranger (Yunosuke Ito) what he could not tell his son. He asks his burning question, how can I live? The two drunken men go and sample what they imagine is life: drinking shops, reviews, dance halls, strip clubs. This is desperate living, another way of dying. Watanabe brings the whole thing to a halt when he requests a pianist to play an old song, and sings the words, about young girls who fall in love and how they should enjoy that love for life is short. Perhaps it was a favourite of he and his wife when they first met. The melody is haunting, and is Watanabe's theme at several key points in the film. Later Watanabe sees Toyo (Miki Odagiri) one of his office colleagues. Watanabe is exhilarated by her joyous love of life, her enthusiasm, even her appetite. Perhaps she will teach him how to live. She teaches him he cannot live by proxy. Watanabe finally discovers fulfillment in doing good for others by using his position at work. Kurosawa opens out the sets progressively. We see the small rooms of Watanabe's house, then the cafe and dance hall scenes at night, then the streets and shops by day, then finally offices, streets and slums as Watanabe moves between the company of government heads of departments, yakuza trying to extort money from them, fellow bureaucrats, workmen and slum dwellers in his quest to have a children's park built. Giving meaning to your life is within everyone's scope, no matter how narrow that scope may be, and enlarges it. There is a touch of the moralist here, but we are liable to forget it as we watch Shimura, small, fragile, bowed over with pain, absolutely determined to make others respond. And they do. 3. The dangers of grief How did Watanabe become the man he is? In his bedroom is a photo of a young, attractive woman, his wife. In a flashback sequence we see her funeral, learn she died unexpectedly when her son was only five or six years old. The beautiful has vanished. This is a theme with haunting overtones in Japanese culture. That power, greatness, beauty is transient can teach us how to live more deeply. But Watanabe has given the dead woman his love and now he cannot stop grieving. In Watanabe's bedroom the photo is next to his citation for exemplary attendance at work. In the funeral car Watanabe watches as the hearse draws further away from him: it's a distance he has tried to deny ever since. 4. The entropy inherent in large structures Watanabe started his bureaucratic life with ambitions to reform. His idealistic report is mouldering away in a bottom drawer. But he's working in a place where the only activity is the filling out of reports, not the achieving of change. It's a kind of tomb. Here no one will accept responsibility; anything unusual, such as the request of a group of neighborhood mothers that a swamp be filled and made into a playground, is frantically passed on to another department. This is not merely satire. The government, of the country as of the local region, is behaving as Watanabe, withdrawing from living and substituting empty formalism in its place. It is no accident Watanabe is head of a department. If we want to we can ask, is it my problem too? The moralist is much more in evidence here. 5. The political response we have to others' actions That Watanabe is not the entire subject of the film is made clear as his death occurs halfway through it. We see the Buddhist wake. The guests at the wake at first give lip service to Watanabe's virtues, then the politicians among them compete for the credit of building the park. The workers in Watanabe's department discuss who will be the next head. The group of petitioners are admitted to pay their respects. They say nothing; but they are grateful. In Japan it matters how the dead are thought of. Kurosawa shows that all the survivors, even the grief stricken, are motivated by personal considerations. He shows this to be natural and inevitable, while satirising more extreme manifestations of it. The mourners cannot give meaning to their life by praising Watanabe though; they will need to strive as hard as Watanabe had: most of them won't. There is a social dimension of our actions, as of our inactions. Kurosawa wants viewers of his film to be at that wake too, and reflect on what Watanabe's life and death meant. Watanabe dies in his playground. He sits on a swing, and sings his song of young girls who fall in love. It is snowing. Watanabe is happy, not because of the playground, not because of the song. He has found something vital. What makes Ikiru an important film is that viewers who watch it can understand just what he has found 
At Ikiru's opening, I started to have real doubts about the film. I had heard that this was Kurosawa's best, and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down. Luckily, that didn't happen. The narrator of the film reminded me of Criswell's narrations to Plan 9 from Outer Space. The film seemed to say too much and show too little. Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work, something clicked. The long duration of the shot and the narrator's continued breakdown of the man's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives, that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds, and that we are powerless to silence it. That floored me, and for the rest of the film, I remained awe-stricken by this humble yet miserable man. Takashi Shimura gives one of the greatest performances I've seen since Raging Bull. Here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world, but he's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt. The horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time. There are points at which the film seems to drag on, but never without purpose. When he dies, having finally given meaning to his existence, his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity, confusion, and finally admiration. The scene lags, which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance 
"Death comes too quickly, enjoy life while you may" is the theme of this picture by Kurosawa. An old man, 25 years a do-nothing, paper-pushing bureaucrat, discovers he's dying of cancer. Suddenly he realizes he's lived an empty life and wants to finally do something for himself. He flounders at first looking for a way and then decides to help get a park built by tenaciously fighting through all the red tape necessary to get the job completed. Most of the movie is concerned with the old man's "false search" for happiness - getting drunk, trying to befriend his young secretary. But then he hits upon his scheme for doing something worthwhile. And here, I think, Kurosawa blunders: he jumps the clock ahead five months to the man's death and tells the old man's story regarding the park in flashbacks as fellow workers and local politicians reminisce at his funeral. It breaks the flow of the movie badly and also changes its focus - we now get an attack on the bureaucracy. For the most part, however, the movie is very moving and the final word almost on the despair of a life not lived. Definitely worth a watch 
Ikiru (To Live) is a chilling depiction of the film's "hero", Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a civil servant, who works in the city office as the Chief clerk. After receiving a medical examination, he discovers that he has gastric cancer in spite of the fact that the doctor informs him that it's merely a mild ulcer. Watanabe seeks guidance on how to spend his entire life savings. He promotes a novelist (Yunesuke Ito) to take him on a bar and club excursion in order to escape from headiness on his that was weighing on his mind. Only after befriending a former employee (Miki Odagiri) who makes toy bunnies for children, he soon decides that he has to do something meaningful for the remaining part of his life - to approve plans to build a city park. This film is gripping in that it relates to the somewhat disillusionment and hope that many Japanese experienced after World War II. The main theme of the film deals with full disclosure or in simple terms, the truth. This assessment may be seen within the film as Watanabe keeps his knowledge of his illness to himself as a way to preserve his life. As he proceeds from day to day, the unbearable ness takes a toll. IRIKURU shows that despite social and cultural differences, individuals deal with unpleasant situations in the same way. Director Akiru Kurosawa was one of the most legendary directors in Japanese film history, and the accompanying screenplay by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni is the most relevant aspect of the film. The cinematography is impeccable and reveals the emotions and actions of the actors. The film is dark and ironic at times - Watanabe's somewhat groaning chant of an old twenties ballad, "Fall in love, dear maiden..." is quiet haunting, but Kurosawa manages to allude to the viewer that a little bit of humor in the midst of death offers a sense of realism to the conscience. No doubt, the film is a great achievement and should be viewed by film buffs or anyone interested in humanistic films without being too sentimental. IKIRU stands as a testament to the human spirit. 
IKIRU means to_live in japanese and this beautiful movie is one of the best representations ever of what really matters in life. Facing an incoming death due to a cancer, a bureaucrat who has wasted 30 years of his life doing nothing uses at his best the last 6 months he has in store. I recommend to watch this movie and also read Seneca's "De brevitate vitae". Life is really too important to be wasted in the idiot things we are forced to do by the stream that carries us away. It is good to watch a good reminder, as this movie is 
If you have never seen his films made in 1950's, you should see them ASAP. You could feel his aggressive and challenging spirit for the movie. The title "Ikiru" means just "Live". This film obviously lets you know what "Live" is. The first time when I saw this movie is 20 years age. In that days there were no video, vcd or dvd player, it was very difficult to see his films even in Japan. But now DVD have been released, How lucky we are! 
"Ikiru" is an emotionally potent, ultimately devastating picture that prove that "cinematic art" isn't an oxymoron. As with many Kurosawa films, one runs the risk of overusing superlatives when trying to describe the effect of watching this movie for the first time. The acting, cinematography, pacing, thematic elements, script, dialogue, intelligence, emotional pitch, and humor in the film are all near-perfect; one would have to search fairly hard to find anything to complain about (perhaps the "partying" scene drags on a few minutes too long?). So I'll just say "Watch it" and point out the most obvious strength - the "dual climax" of an ending. Who other than Kurosawa would follow one of the most touching scenes in film history with one of the most bitter - almost nihilistic - codas imaginable? Who would even think of using the inspirational story of one man's struggle to give his empty life meaning to point out the unfailing (and apparently permanent) passive destruction wreaked by a bureaucratic society? So perhaps the most impressive feature of the film is its ability to inspire even while ackowledging the dearth of humanity in modern society. Never has a film been more idealistic in its presentation of one man's ability to find fulfillment in giving to others, and never has a film been more cynical in its portrayal of one man's ultimate inability to inspire any lasting change in a corrupt culture. While only loosely adapting from Dostoyevsky's source novel, AK perfectly captures the Russian's spirit, that immediately identifiable blend of savage satire and melancholy idealism that ran throughout the author's work (most notably in "The Idiot", not surprisingly another novel AK had previously adapted). Along with epilepsy and alcoholism, Dostoyevsky and Kurosawa shared this sensibility, this powerful belief that the world could be a decent place if people would just make the slightest humanitarian effort, combined with a kind of quiet rage when faced with the reality that humanity as a whole simply will not ever make that effort. Never have these entwined themes been so powerfully expressed on film as they are in "Ikiru." 
I agree with all the other reviews which have discussed "Ikiru" in terms of its message for the individual: live your life with meaning and purpose, take pleasure in helping others, cherish and nurture children. However, there is one other aspect that I'd like to highlight: Kurosawa's thoughts on the individual and society. As the commentary by Stephen Prince makes clear, one of the main points behind Kurosawa's work was a head-on critique of Japanese society in the immediate post-war era. Although this period laid the foundation for Japan's economic recovery, Kurosawa is not alone in pointing out that the drive for economic prosperity was accomplished at huge human and spiritual cost. This idea is also one of the prime motivators behind the work of other Japanese artists from humanists like Hayao Miyazaki ("Spirited Away", "Princess Mononoke") to the lunatic right as exemplified by Mishima. Kurosawa uses Watanabe Kenji as a foil to expose the hypocrisy and selfishness of a society that values materialism and order above humanity and mindfulness. On the one hand, as most of the other reviewers have pointed out, Kurosawa condemns the way the bureaucratic small-mindedness of government stifles any real concern for the well-being of ordinary people. On the other, Watanabe's son and daughter-in-law embody the new age's impatience with its elders and their inability to see beyond their own concerns even when the people around them are clearly in crisis. A number of people have complained about the length of the second half of the movie, but (as Prince's commentary again makes clear), the flashbacks are important to establish a stronger sense of Watanabe's co-workers as characters both to illustrate their gradual understanding of the meaning of Watanabe's life but also to highlight their inability to really follow his example. Kurosawa's view of society is pretty cynical when you come right down to it. Even though many of his works are celebrations of individual creativity and spirit, he is also forthright about the forces arrayed against it: small-mindedness, fear of making mistakes, greed and the herd mentality. It's no wonder that he has often been accused of being "un-Japanese". One can also see this thread in Kurosawa's later movies including his period pieces such as "Seven Samurai" and "Kagemusha": in both of these films, the ordinary folks and the high and mighty are also found wanting as groups. While there may be individuals of principle, they will not prevail in the end. But, and Kurosawa makes this point in each of his movies, the efforts of such individuals are the true definition of nobility of spirit, and it is this message which provides the power behind all of his works. This is a wonderful piece of movie making. It is humanism at its most trenchant and finest. You must see this film, it is one of the best movies of all time. 
My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss. Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD. Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion. Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it. One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld. The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it. According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history. So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge. On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease." Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software. "Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES. This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes). So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect. Even the bad guys seem familiar. Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer. They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl. Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree. The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner. A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development. I am normally opposed to remakes. For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films. The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake. But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original. The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life. As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive. For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs. The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects. The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle. My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum. All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film. It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation: JURASSAIC PARK. Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks. Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie. 
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie 
A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood. Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World. Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale. Seriously, why is somebody not making this already 
I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night. She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film. One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene. I like chase scenes. Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection. A few good comic shots. Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break. 
I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!  
It was a great movie. If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there. I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real. It was a movie worth buying 
In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them. Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land". The DVD has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi. Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall 
The first time I watched In Good Company I said to myself, eh not good, not bad, just pretty average. A couple reviews reflect that. But ever since HBO started playing the movie constantly I find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more. The best quality about this film is that it's real. You watch the story progress and you feel like you're watching reality. I never found myself saying, how unrealistic, that could never happen. The character's emotions seem real, the situations seem real. That all points to a well-acted, well-written film. Also, the movie doesn't try too hard. It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, doesn't go out of its way to give you a sappy, predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with. Just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of Hollywood fantasy 
Not a typical no brainer movie. This movie presents complex people with complex motives. Topher Grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives, yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways. He is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life. This lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife. He focuses on his job even though he isn't passionate about the work. Quaid does not like his demotion, yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn't try to sabatoge him. This is where the film differs from other, inferior movies. He is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it. He even tries to help his new boss. The love story is played with honesty since Quaid's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone, yet she's attracted to her dad's new boss. Don't expect cheap laughs and simple answers 
I first saw this in the theatre because I like Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson. I had never really seen Topher Grace outside of 'That 70's Show' which I never kept up with on a regular basis. I fell in love the movie first time I saw it and bought it soon after it came out on DVD. Mr. Grace plays a 26 year-old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend. He's become such a machine in a competivie world that he's loses his way in life. I was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too. One of mentor's has told me repeatedly that the mid-twenties can be one of the roughest times in life. So many things are going at once on so many levels. To me, this movie captured that. Paul Weitz did a great job writing this. The cast was exquisite 
I always this dislike those raunchy humor comedies(always with some expections like Harold and Kumar), many to list but In Good Company is a very original movie and fits perfectly as comedy and drama there is never a dull or slow moment in the whole movie all the chacters are likeable,Topher is a pretty good actor and he has a great future as a comedian(by the way i think Topher is a great choice for Eddie Brocks in Spider-man 3)he is very funny in "That 70 Show" too, Scarlett was excellent(i never see a bad movie from her), with no dobut one the best young actress in the actual hollywood,the story is great and original,drama works fine the direction also is very good and the movie skips any raunchy joke,in my opinion In Good Company by far is one the best comedies i ever seen and one my favorites comedies too,i gonna buy my copy!  acting: 10/10 direction: 10/10 story 10/10 Overall 10/1 
Dennis Quaid ranks high in our family video night; both the Parent Trap and the Rookie are among our young children's favorites. For my wife and I, I rented In Good Company due to Quaid, and because the film intrigued me: its trailer and synopsis do not rely on quick action or screwball comedy.... it was different from most of what I see. In Good Company relies on its characters. I don't know the corporate world, but as corporations seem to be today's "Resident Evil" (pun intended), I liked a story where a heart is found in the Oz less world of layoffs and cubicles. What I liked most was the interaction between Dan Forman, played by Quaid, and Carter Duryea, played by Topher Grace. Carter is fatherless; basically he's parentless, and the film shows a close Foreman family but has little, and little positive, reference to Carter's upbringing. Carter's world is psyche, synergy, cell phones and Sports America, where he now runs sales. As the film progresses we are treated not just to an old school/new school, hip/over the hill tension, but see a young man learn character, in work and family, from someone who has done it right. There are limitations, as when Foreman tells Duryea that the secret to a good marriage is to find the right woman and keep your organ in your pants when you are away from home. This is not too helpful for Carter, whose seven-month marriage to the wrong woman shows a need for more than luck. But overall he learns that life is more than suits, cars, and success... he longs for he does not have. Throughout we see the pain of a young man all alone in the world, someone who has had no one to guide him. In one scene, Morty, played by David Paymer, states that the right timing is important. The film could easily have dived into a happy ending where everyone has a job and where Carter gets the girl, but it makes a good move by remaining true to that line. When Carter hugs Foreman goodbye he squeezes him and breaks down. When we next see Carter he is jogging outside rather than on a treadmill. He may not know where his path will lead, but now, thanks for Dan Foreman, he is no longer running in circles. 
Upon seeing previews at the theater for In Good Company, my first instinct was to avoid it like the plague. Based on the apparent target demographic for this film, it was marketed horribly. The trite title and kitchy manner in which the preview clips were edited reminded me too much of those shallow adoloescent throwaway Disney films - the type hollywood routinely pukes out for 14 year old girls. And knowing Dennis Quaid's penchant for appearing in such films, I assumed In Good Company was another one of those. Recently however, I stumbled across the movie's opening credits on HBO. "I'll stay long enough to make fun of it.", I thought to myself. But in a matter of minutes, I was completely sucked in. The writing was intelligent and the tone often dark. This is a movie that, on the surface appears to be a natural born comedy, yet it resists the obvious cornball pitfalls at every turn. The characters are not 1 dimesnional buffoons, but are written to be very believable people with real problems. Every time I smelled a cliche or overly sentimental twist coming, the film continued to surprise me by not taking the easy way out. Is it a perfect film? No. In Good Company is not without its flaws. But they are very few and very forgivable. This one is proof that you can't judge a DVD by its cover 
In Good Company isn't a hilarious comedy, nor a serious, "edge-of-your-seat" drama - yet something about it made it one of the most absorbing movies of 2005, pleasantly fascinating and easy to watch. The story is about a middle-aged sales exec (Dennis Quaid) who's company is sold, with over-night demotion and a new boss (Topher Grace), a young whipper-snapper half his age and pathetically callow, though exuding infectious confidence and ambition of youth. The new boss even naively falls for his older worker's daughter, oblivious to the obvious impracticality.  So without a lot of hilarious comedy nor a suspenseful plotline, what makes In Good Company so interesting? Two things I think. One, the movie starts out with a premise that lends itself to extremely cynical comedy (like the Simpsons), but very realistically and gradually rises above that temptation to a conclusion that's uplifting in spite of the realistic situation. Second, the unusual platonic chemistry between the two male leads seems real and strangely appealing, like you want to know these people and root for their friendship. You don't see that done well in the movies often, and this is probably the most effective case since Cary Grant and Ronald Coleman in Talk Of The Town (in which they were in a romantic triangle with Jean Arthur, so it's really not the same situation). I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean 
I loved this movie. The acting was great and the their interactions throughout the movie interesting. Its amazing how some movies just don't have the ability to keep my interest but this one definitely pulled me in right from the start and built as the movie progressed. Very enjoyable and with some good laughs. 
I wanted to see a movie one evening, and it really didn't matter what movie, I just wanted to get out of the house, and get to a theater. I looked at the listings and decided to see "In Good Company", and I'm certainly glad I did. I found this movie to be very entertaining, and very enjoyable to watch. I thought this movie really showed a new edge to Scarlett Johansson as well. In a way this movie was also an eye-opener on todays' corporate America, and its' all too often pitfalls. Nicely produced, acted, and directed. 
"In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise. If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two. I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced. Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling. Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
This video delves into the people and the events of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, John Berendt's wildly popular non-fiction novel about the sleepy, isolated city of Savannah, Georgia. It was great to finally see the video, and found it quite informative and interesting. Particularly interesting, was the interview with the crime scene photographer, who has with him some of the pictures he took that day--most notably that of Hansford's over the gun he was supposedly going to fire. The video also does well in documenting the varying opinions of other Savannians towards the whole Midnight phenomena. Missing from the video, for obvious reasons, is refence to Lee Adler and Luther Driggers. Also, the video does not go into the issue of race, which Berendt readily discussed in the book. 
Murder,mayhem, socialites, mansions, high powered lawyers and big time murder trial, Lady Chablis, Angel, the Spiritual Psychic (who incidently can be found at www.angelmindbodyspirit.com)and was very informative on Voodoo, make up the setting for and awesome documentary Midnight in Savannah. Once you become a part of this documentary, you will understand why tourism has increased here in beautiful Savannah.I would love to see more reviews from those who agree and disagree 
This video is excellently done and proves to be much better than the movie. Interviews all the real characters and presents numerous scenic views of Savannah 
Good movie to show people the difference between ballroom dance and fun dance. Best dance movie I ever seen 
If you like to dance or like to watch other people dance then this is the movie for you. That's especially true if you like a latin beat in your music. Nice story line and in the end girl not only gets the trophy but gets the guy also! A little laughing and a little crying and a lot of dancing. What more could you ask for. 
This is a great movie!!!! I loved the music, dancing, and the intense chemistry between the actors. I especially enjoyed the handsome, sexy Chayanne!!! He's an excellent singer, dancer, and actor!! He and Vanessa looked amazing together. I prefer this movie to Dirty Dancing. If anyone wants to see and hear more of Chayanne, he's in a new commercial, and has realeased a new video from his latest album Cautivo, which has gone multi-platinum! 
I usually stay away from the chick-flick genre that I was forced to watch with my ex-wife, daughter and, prior to that various and sundry dates...but, from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film, I was drawn into the world of proffesional Latin dancing. I readily admit that my initial interest was to see Vanessa, since, in my opinion, she makes too few films. But, the infectious sountrack and the easy-looking, but incredibly intricate dance performances of Chayanne and crew, made me say, to quote a line from the film, "I want to do that, too!" Chayanne, who is probably a superstar in latin circles, gives a utilitarian acting performance, however appealing his personality, and this whole movie was never in danger of being an oscar contender, however, I reiterate, the dance sequences are exilerating. A solid family movie, and with the popularity of "Dancing With the Stars," should be a must-see for fans of that show 
After watching the film and wanting to get up and dance to the music this CD is a dream come true ! "Echa Pa'Lante" is now one of my favourite Cha Cha's and Ruby's Rumba "Eres Todo En Mi" is great to dance with a special partner. "Jazz Machine - Black Machine" is a great Samba track which will also get you on the dance floor. If the film inspired you to get up and dance this CD should be on your playlist 
This is a nice movie. Not an Oscar winner, but very pleasant and no sex (a virtue/shortcoming depending on your point of view). I purchased the movie for the salsa dancing, but all of the dancing and music in the movie are great. From the opening scenes staged in Cuba to the last dance scene the the movie is big time fun. It also is beautifully filmed. Chaynne and Vanessa are both easy on the eyes so each gender will enjoy it. The movie is defintely worth a viewing 
I love a good dance movie and this is one for the collection. This dvd sells for about $7.00 at thiat price it is a very good buy 
This movie is great. Vanessa Williams is not only beautiful, but you would think she has been competing in professional Latin dancing for real-she is very talented. Chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming-not to mention easy on the eyes. The dance scenes are HOT!! It is loaded with not only great dances, but great Latin music and likable characters. It is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor!!!   
I love Neil Diamond and this movie is wonderful. I first saw it 20 yrs ago in my early teens and it is still one of my all time favs. Now my son loves it as well. It's a non country version of Pure Country, only quite a few years earlier. Neil Diamond has a one of a kind voice of an ange 
A very good movie, great sound but this edition needs more extras 
Pleased with DVD now I can Watch Neil Diamond any time I want 
I received the product in a reasonable time. The quality of the product was terrific. Have really enjoyed watching it 
EXCELLENT!!!! Brought back a lot of nice memories from years ago" Sound track is wounderful! 5***** all the way! Highly recommand" 
Don't listen to the critics about The Jazz Singer. I just saw the movie again after about 15 years, and it's still wonderful. I thought everyone did a great. I've always been a Neil Diamond and Lucie Arnez fan, and they are both terrific. I'm now anxious to listen to my Jazz Singer soundtrack again. Wonderful songs and great acting by everyone. Some critics stated with was a BOMB, but don't listen to them. The movie is 116 minutes and the time just flew by for me. I feel watching it now it's gotten better and better. The extras are pretty good with long detailed information about the main actors. I wish Neil or Lucie would have done commentary, but still a winner in my boo 
This is a marvelous experience! I first saw "The Jazz Singer" in 1980 in the cinema and was immediately hooked on Neil Diamond. It was gratifying to find a Jewish story on the big screen, too, with Shabbat and Yom Kippur services and Hebrew songs, juxtaposed with Diamond's secular hits. Looking back after 26 years of life experience and three extended stays in Israel, I can't help but to have warm memories of this movie. The story, in my opinion, was sufficient to maintain interest, and although the acting was either VERY method (and who can forget Olivier's "Eye Heff No Son!!"--how often has THAT been passed into popular culture such as "The Simpsons!") or painfully amateur, this film is eminently enjoyable. 
I had always liked this movie. Any time it was on, I would watch it because I enjoyed the music and because, despite the bad acting, it still had a really good story. Until... Until I turned back to traditional Judaism in my 30's. This movie sends a CLEAR message to a Jew - "Lighten up and enjoy the secular world. It ain't so bad." I grew to hate the fact that Olivier's character (as Diamond's father) strove against Diamond's desires to forego his Jewish identity in search of a temporal pop dream. And Diamond wins! When a movie champions secular idealogies removing a Jew from his roots and assimilating him into secular society, it can't help but make a traditional Jew very very sad... 
This is what happens when musicians (at least most of them) foray into fields in which they should not trod. I had the great fortune of seeing Neil Diamond "live" shortly after the release of this movie and, like always, he brought down the house. He just may be one of the greatest entertainers who ever graced a concert stage. As a singer-songwriter, they don't make 'em better (Remember that he honed his craft during the golden age of the late 60's at the famous Brill Building in New York City where artists such as Carole King Gerry Goffin, Howard Greenfield Neil Sedaka and Phil Spector (to name just a few) were also honing THEIR crafts). The point is that Mr. Diamond is second to none in the field of Rock/Pop Music and the day he stops recording and entertaining will be the music industry's huge loss. As for this movie - Let me just say this: If you take away the music sequences, what you have left is some of the most horrible stuff ever seen on film. This movie is so inept that even a legend like Lawrence Olivier (who plays Cantor Rabinovich, Mr. Diamond's jewish father)stinks. His acting is so 'hammy' that it's embarrasing. I mean, when he blurts out "I hef no son!" after realizing that his son (Mr. Diamond) is sleeping with Ms. Arnaz, I lost it! And Lucie Arnaz? Oh my!! How about "I DON'T Love Lucy"? Her acting is so amateurish that it's hard not to giggle. And this 25th Anniversary edition dvd is not that impressive, either. The picture quality is poor (very grainy). The sound quality is very good, though, but the DTS will not be appreciated unless you have the surround sound system to accommodate it. My advice is wait for a year or so until this movie comes down to $9.99 (which it will) - Even though it does have some fine extras, it just isn't worth the current price. The best part of the film? The "Songs of Life" sequence. A beautiful song and a touching moment in this otherwise awful film. 
This is simply the best film of all time. If you want something that is as close to my life as you're going to get, this is it. I'm not jewish, but I can relate to the lifestyle growing up in West Omaha. It was a jewish kind of suburb without the little hats. I can flat sing, DO NOT ARGUE WITH ME ON THAT ONE!!!! I write my own songs about all kinds of things. I write about birds, bowling, canned peaches, why all the countries around russia have different names now and why a ref cost Nebraska the national title in 94 against FSU. I can do that where maybe you can not. I have the ability to make changes on the fly. My story is very similiar to Neil Diamond's character. I grew up in Nebraska, spent some time in Dallas and settled in east G-town. I never recorded an album and have only been to California once. So you can see where I relate to this film. I do like to sing though, as you can tell by my wonderous tales of bands I've fronted. Let me tell you about another one. I've always been a Neil Diamond fan, so I fronted a speed metal Neil Diamond cover band called Moldy Applecore. We took Neil's music and sped it up. When you have Jabs playin leadbass like his kids are being held hostage by Mayor McCheese, Kroll drumming like he's being chased by a drunk fat girl and me belting out Diamond standards like I wrote them, the world is your audience. We sold out the Gretna bowl in 3 minutes last summer. We played a 52 minute version of "America" that included several america themed songs stuck in to change tempo. We threw "Grand old Flag" and "Born in the USA" in the second 20 minutes of the song. The crowd went nuts and felt more patriotic than when Kerrie Strug ran into the pommel cow when he hip broke in 95. This movie is the blueprint for moldy applecore. That alone makes it the best film of all time. I'm awesome, in case you were wondering 
Being born in '66, the Shindig! video series was something of a revelation to me; rock'n'roll is supposed to be fun! This volume of the Shindig! series highlighting Jerry Lee Lewis is incredibly enjoyable! I never really was familiar with much of the music of Mr. Lewis until I bought this tape. "Whole Lotta Shakin'" looks like the biggest party on stage (watch for Jackie Wilson and the Righteous Brothers in the sing-along,) "Rockin' Pneumonia" is a percussive rocker, and the best performance (in my opinion,) is "I Believe in You" Jerry sings with every last ounce of strength he's got backed with enthusiastic vocals by the Blossoms (with the great Darlene Love) and the Wellingtons and of course an incredible dance routine by the Shindig Dancers. This tape is gonna leave you "Breathless" everytime you view it! And as one other reviewer referred to, you won't believe what this man can do with "Take Me Out to the Ballgame!" (and what other show would have Neil Sedaka perched at a piano on top of another piano played by "The Killer"? 
Jerry Lee is rocking and rolling through this short but outstanding time-document. Compare this to recent TV-shows of new artists, and you know why Jerry Lee is called "The Killer". This tape is a real collectors item 
Susan Ward,coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on TV, gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from AOL Films. Director Mary Lambert tries and fails to give us a Basic Instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures, it looks like Warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with. As the lack of film sets show. If you like Susan Ward, then give this a movie a try, if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future, DON"T FIND IT HERE 
Quite obviously this movie didn't get any Oscars, but then again if you're watching this kind of movie, you're not expecting Oscar material. The plot was slightly above par, the acting- not so much. But this movie was FUN. Personally, I think it should have been in theaters longer, it's no worse then any other teen horror movie that was out at that time (Remember the travesty that was "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"?) and I believe it could have done reasonably well. So, if you're looking for a fun movie and not an Oscar Winner, you can't go wrong here. Also, the commentary is hysterical; I'd but the DVD just for that. 
while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die? have i gone to horrible movie hell?" you see i was trapped in a theater. it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat. the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape. in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow. but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
A young girl is tired of her stepmother and her new baby half-brother. But when she makes a comment that she wants the Goblin King to take her brother, it really happens. She is visited by the King (David Bowie) and learns that if she can get to his castle at the center of the labyrinth in thirteen hours, she will have the chance to get her brother back. She starts out and quickly learns that things are very different and that things are not fair. But ,fair or not, she needs to learn how to be unfair as well in order to penetrate the labyrinth. Along the way she meets strange characters and befriends a few. all the while the Goblin King is doing what he can to impede her. Traps and spells are laid and if she falls to any of them she will lose and her brother will become a goblin. In the end we get a good strong message about not giving up on our dreams. With a script by Terry Jones, designs by Brian Froud and Jim Henson in charge of it all, you just know this is going to be something special and unique. The film starts mundanely but quickly progresses to huge amounts of puppets and fabulous effects. The characters are very memorable although I felt Bowie could have done without the blonde Elvira-wig. Still, it have been a very rewatchable film that I have seen in the theater, on video, and now on widescreen DVD. A fun film that is safe and appealing to almost all ages. Check it out 
This amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability. The combination of puppets and live action works really well, David Bowie is wonderful, and, all in all, it's a great family film. When I gave it to my two granddaughters, ages 8 4, they watched it wide-eyed and a little bit scared. But then they watched it at least once a day for the next week 
This Jim Henson fantasy, which is now 20-years-old, is a delightful treat that your children will enjoy tremendously. [Adults too!] I know both of my daughters do! The film "Labyrinth" is a very well done muppet film starring a very young Jennifer Connelly, and David Bowie. Jennifer Connelly wishes for the Goblins to take her brother away--and they do! And of course the Goblin King is noneother than David Bowie. The film is very entertaining and the children will find this a delightful treat. My children have seen it countless times, and never tire of it. As Jennifer Connelly begins to search for her little brother [she has only a limited amount of time to search for him, or her brother will belong to the Goblin King forever] she encounters all sorts of fascinating creatures along the way. Making the task more difficult for her, however, is the maze she must traverse in order to locate her brother. The Labyrinth she is inside has numerous false pathways; some which lead to doom, while others go in the wrong direction. And as she tries to find her way to the center, she meets some of the most interesting characters in the film who eventually decide that they will help her on her journey. The film is Highly recommended, your children will enjoy this film! [And once again, Adults too!] 
I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
I love this movie. I've enjoyed it with my children and now am watching it with my grandchildren. I think it's suitable for children over 6 years of age 
 No matter is an old movie, the quality of it is great; the sound and the picture itself 
This fantasy-adeventure film from 1986 is courtesy of four wonderful talents: Jennifer Connelley ("Once Upon A Time In America," "The Rocketeer," "A Beautiful Mind," Academy Award, 2001; hard to believe that she was just fourteen at the time), Jim Henson ("The Dark Crystal," TV's "Sesame Street"), singer David Bowie (proving that he can act as well as sing; he should do more films) and George Lucas (the "STAR WARS" movies, "THX 1138," "American Graffiti," the "Indiana Jones" films, executive producer and writer). The story is well-crafted; no, I will not rehash it. SPOILER-I would have preferred some more sentimentality at the end of the movie-SPOILER OVER. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. Special features include the original theatrical trailer and a 56 minute, in-depth "Making-Of" documentary with reflections from the cast and crew. Rated PG for comic violence 
The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy. This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more. Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work). Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin. Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey. The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people. The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen. The film is supplemented on this DVD with a "Making-of" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986). Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors). It's a lot of fun to see this "inside" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him. My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), "When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the things that matter to me," - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age. Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more "real" than many of today's "realities" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting. As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary). Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :- 
This film is really only good for two things. 1. Chris O'Donnell appears without his shirt on for one scene 2. Faye Dunaway plays a crazy drunk (ultimate camp! 
Apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime, the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment. It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson. There was a new hope in that man. But that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit Paris Dauphine, Universit Paris I Panthon Sorbonne 
Gene Hackman's electrifying performance dominates this adaptation of John Grisham's best selling novel. Hackman portrays Sam Cayhall, a man who's been on death row for sixteen years for the bombing of a lawyer's office that resulted in the death of the lawyer's two children. Cayhall is a vile man, who has lived a life of hatred and prejudice, the result of generations of such bigoted ancestors. Enter Chris O'Donnell as his young grandson, who is a lawyer and wants to reopen the case and spare his grandfather the gas chamber. What ensues is a painful exploration of hatred, prejudice and a dysfunctional family. I liked the movie, in spite of its several flaws. Hackman is phenomenal, and Chris O'Donnell does a good job as the naively innocent, but determined, young barrister. Faye Dunaway offers wonderful support as Hackman's estranged daughter who has lived a life of secrecy and guilt. Lela Rochon, Raymond Barry, David Marshall Grant and Robert Prosky offer fine support too. I found myself involved in the movie, and feel it didn't offer any easy answers. Hackman is a guilty man, but his performance is so well doone that one can't help but feel sorry for the life he has chosen, and the life he has sacrificed. I think it's well worth viewing 
The acting, writing, and complete look of the film are completely fantastic. Everything is fantastic, but Jim Carrey steals the scenes, in a very good way. Every time he is on the screen, he is pure Jim. The character he plays on the movie is as if it was written just for him, he fits is role perfectly. The scenery in the movie is very dark and gloomy, which sets the perfect tone for the film. The costumes; suits and dresses, all look great and the entire things comes together very nicely. Overall, this is a must see for fans of Jim Carrey. If you love a good movie, you will love this. Like I said, this role was made for JC!! 
Both of my daughter's read the entire series of books [so far] and I decided to treat them to this film when it was released. Or was it the other way around. Anyway, suffice it to say, I was more than pleased with this film. The devious Count Olaf [Jim Carrey] was a true joy to watch. And the laughter from my daughters was more than worth sitting through the movie. I really enjoyed the film, and let me tell you, children as well as adults will enjoy this film! On a visual level, the film is absolutely stunning: sort of a Tim Burton influence. I really liked the part of Aunt Josephine [Meryl Streep]. There is a hilarious part with her and Count Olaf as she is about to be let go on one of the boats. (I'll let you viewers watch this part, as I don't wish to spoil it for you). And the house Aunt Josephine resides in at Lake Lachrymose has a surrealistic and eerie look to it. Just great! If you have not seen the film, then rent it or buy it. I found it to be hilarious and as much fun for adults as well as children. I really do hope they make another one: as the books continue for quite some time. I believe the first three books were the basis for this particular film. I would like to see more misadventures of the Baudelaire children with their nemesis Count Olaf, I don't know if there will be, but it would be great. And how about the end credits? Best I have ever seen: A work of art in itself. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed--especially if you have children. 
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, the movie, is an adaptation of the first 3 books in the Lemony Snicket's printed books. The movie plot is very much the same as the story of the first three books. #1 - The Bad Beginning #2 - The Reptile Room #3 - The Wide Window In the Series of Unfortunate Events isn't a happily ever after kind of story. There are three regular children: Violet, who loves to invent Klaus, who loves to read and Sunny who loves to bite Violet is the oldest, Claus the middle child, Sunny is the youngest. The book "The Bad Beginning" is the basis for the first part of the movie. The story begins when the Baudelaire children are informed by Mr. Poe, a banking accountant, that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire, and thus begins a series of search for a suitable guardian and a safe place to live. The siblings closest member to their parents is supposedly Count Olaf, only he's not nice. He's exactly the opposite and he plans to steal the immense fortune left by the Baudelaire parents. In The Bad Beginning, things, well, begin badly for the three Baudelaire orphans. And sadly, events only worsen in The Reptile Room. As the siblings move in with their new guardian Professor Montgomery, they find he is a reptile scientist. In a room with many different reptiles, there's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly, dangerous snake. But it's not really dangerous at all. Later Montes get a new assistant and it is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course something terrible happens to Uncle Morty after that and Count Olaf again tries to kidnap the children. In the Wide Window, Mr. Poe places the children with a distant relative, Aunt Josephine. Aunt Josephiine lives in a house on the edge of a hill, a house that is very literally above Lake Lachrymose, a lake infested with Lachrymose Leeches who would eat a human if they smelled food on them. Aunt Josephine is as eccentric as other relatives have been. She's a total grammar freak and so scared of every thing that the children have to live in a cold house and eat cold food because their aunt is afraid of accidents with fire. When Aunt Josephine meets Captain Sham who (who is Count Olaf in disguise), good fortune turns bad. Aunt Josephine dies and the apparent cause of death is jumping through the wide window in the living room, leaving the three children to Captain Sham (who is Count Olaf in disguise). As the orphans try to figure out a way to escape from Count Olaf, they discover their aunt is still alive and in hiding. So they set out to find her and convince her to come back. This eventually leads them out onto the dreadful Lake Lachrymose where Count Olaf and the dreaded leaches catch up with them. While the books leave much to the imagination, the visual effects and stunning backdrdops of the movie are well detailed, in contrast to the often sparse details in the books. 
I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round. The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but "Lemony Snicket..." entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!). There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzmï¿½n, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Cedric the Entertainer...) in small roles. Sublime film. It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, and if you like unique plots, highly recommended for all type of audiences! 
This movie is based on the first three books in the series of thirteen very short volumes. A lot of people, who apparrently hadn't read the book(s) say Jim Carey basically played himself in the movie, but this couldn't be further from the truth--he played the part perfectly. I'm not a big Jim Carey fan, but think he does get a bad rap for no apparrent reason. The last big criticism of him was for Cable Guy--in which he actually played a serious role. I suppose Cable Guy was a comedy, but it was a 'black comedy' and this movie is much the same. Sure this movie (and the written story) is funny, but it's also in that Harry Potter (or Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland, or The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, or many other much greater and confirmed classic 'children's stories') stream of being a good story for children that's not the traditional 'happily ever after.' It wont give your kids nightmares or bruise their fragile sensibilities, but it might fire a few more brain cells than other childrens stories which strain themselves not to cross those lines parents draw in our V-chip American society. Put more frankly, your kids wont turn into serial killers because they watched or read something that wasn't completely innocent, puritanical, or childish. Bottom Line: Because the movie really turned me onto the books, I'm glad I saw it. I also think this is a great performance by Jim Carey, from whom we normally expect only silliness. 
I saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film 
This is Carey at his best. This movie is hilarious and the special features are awesome 
A delightful little movie based on a series of delightful little children's stories (with, maybe, a bit more bite than the average fare). Of course, it won't be for everyone. A Series of Unfortunate Events is about the three Baudelaire orphans who are shuttled from foster home to foster home pursued by the evil Count Olaf. A laughable, over-the-top villain determined to capture the orphans' family fortune. This movie takes the first three novels of the series (purported to be 13 books in all, plus an "autobiography" of the "author") and blends them wonderfully into one tale (sticking the 2nd and 3rd into the middle of the first book). It brings the tales to life with delightful scenery and excellent casting. Jim Carrey brings Olaf to life. And, YES, he is "overacting" but he is absolutely true to the character in the books. He is perfect in his role. Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep have great turns as well. If you're a fan of these books, you likely won't be disappointed. If you've never read them, you may like this movie too, just know that it's a little stylized and "over the top." In the end, it's a lot of fun, and not that's not such an unfortunate thing in a film 
It happens every time that a novel is turned into a mainstream film. Fans of the book just go crazy if the screenplay and execution of the film aren't an exact replica of the written novel. I've never made or written a film in my lifetime, but I am guessing that it would be tough to fit a 600 page book into a 2-hour film without taking some shortcuts. Even I fall into this category sometimes, and I can understand that if you really loved a book, you would hate to see the film version turn out to be a complete horror-show. But even I have come to realize that to enjoy the film version of a novel, you must go into the movie with absolutely no preconceived notions of what to expect. Film and literature are just too different from each other to make a smooth transition. Having said that, almost everyone knows the plot of the book/movie. Sherman McCoy and his mistress, Maria, are lost in the Bronx one night. Avoiding details, Sherman and Maria get caught up in a sticky situation with a couple of youths, and in the scuffle, one of them gets hit by the car while Maria is driving. This incident turns into a city-wide scandal. Al Sharpton-inspired Reverend Bacon starts appealing to the black community. District Attorney and mayorial candidate Weiss decides to use the incident for political advantage. Journalist Peter Fallow sees an opportunity to remove his career from the gutter by having "exclusive rights" to the story. From there, the story revolves around Sherman's battle with the courts, media, and community. The film's pacing is a little off at some points, but the acting ensemble pulls the film through all the moments that feel like they might be getting boring. Morgan Freeman stands out in an unfortunately small role as the judge presiding over Sherman's case. His speech at the end of the movie is one of the best acting moments in his career, in my opinion. Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis don't exactly give the best performances of their career, but they do an adequate job of presenting the characters for what they are. A lot of the fans of the book criticize the film because they think that the movie's characters aren't as selfish, greedy, and manipulative as they are in the book. I simply believe that the filmmakers didn't think that the movie's humor would come across as much if the viewer was inclined to absolutely despise each and every character of interest. If you haven't read the novel, I would highly recommend this film to any movie fan. It's funny, interesting, and has some very good social commentary along the way. If you've read the book, however, stay away unless you have an open mind and an understanding of what the words "film adaptation" mean when you put them together.. 
The Bonfire Of The Vanities is an underrated gem directed by Brian DePalma (Scarface), and featuring an all-star cast including Academy Award winners Tom Hanks (Big, Forrest Gump), Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby, Driving Miss Daisy), F Murray Abraham (Amadeus), and a supporting cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Melanie Griffith (Shining Through), and Kim Cattrall (Turk 182). The story depicts a decaying society infested with racism, greed, hypocrisy, and corruption. The particular society in focus here is New York City, where an incident that signifies a major clash between the white upper class and the black lower class becomes media dinner. Hanks plays Sherman McCoy, a wealthy businessman who cheats on his wife, played by Cattrall, with another rich man's wife Maria Ruskin, played by Griffith. On one of their nights on the town, McCoy and Ruskin find themselves in the slums of New York, where they are jumped by two black youths, and end up committing a hit and run as they run over one of the kids as they flee in McCoy's car. This goes straight to headline news. The African American community are not pleased, the mayor of the city, played hysterically by Abraham, wants to gain Black support by taking a rich 'white' turkey to court and reprimending him; in this case, the turkey is McCoy, a religious man who's only after money, and a drunken down-on-his-luck reporter Peter Fallow, played by Willis, who's hot on McCoy's tracks for this could be the story that will bring him to the top of his game, and in the longer run, make him a star of the moment. Everybody's in for a surprise, however, to find out that Ruskin was the one driving the car, not McCoy, but the entire city wants McCoy's neck anyways. McCoy, on the other hand, must play a dirty game to clear his name even if it means that he should break the law. The Bonfire Of the Vanities has no heroes. All the characters in the movie symbolize very dirty and corrupt people. The only voice of wisdom in the film is the judge, played by Freeman, hot off his Oscar nominated performance in Driving Miss Daisy, who gives a convincing speech at the end of the movie. Even though the movie flopped in 1990 when it was released and today is considered one of the worst films ever made, I find Bonfire a truly unappreciated social commentary take on a dysfunctional system with ordinary people working as organizers of the system. It's a bittersweet slice of American realism that many people tend to walk away from. Recommended 
This is the dilemma the critics faced when reviewing this movie. And their problem was--they didn't like either the truth or the political incorrectness of this film. I've lived in New York and the truth of the depiction in this movie rang all too true. I was also shocked that any moviemaker would have the courage to present some of these truths, because they are blatantly politically incorrect. I doubt whether such a movie could me made nowadays. If it could, only the most independent of indies could make it. So, if you want to enjoy what may be one of your last chances to see politically incorrect truths on film, this is it. Besides, it's a good movie. Tom Hanks tears your heart out as the wrongfully accused guy. Melanie is lovable as always, bless her lacivious heart. Morgan Freeman stood out--doesn't he always? The movie grips you from start to finish and doesn't let up for a moment. The ending is satisfying. Bottom line: forget the politcal pundits and enjoy the movie. 
I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie before I saw it. After I saw it I thought it was great. Tom Hanks is exactly what you'd expect from a guy whose won 2 Oscars and Morgan Freeman gives a very powerful performance as well (in fact his monolouge at the end is incredible). Definately worth your time, as is the book of the same name 
OK, everyone just "knows" that some films are really awful, like Ishtar, The Bonfire of the Vanities, etc. Funny how few people you know who actually saw those films, isn't it? I for one loved this funny, insightful film, and if there was any justice in the world, it would've won Brian DePalma a Best Director Oscar instead of being an albatross around his neck. In case you hadn't noticed, critics are (being human) subject to peer pressure, so when this movie was released in 1990, they acted like a herd of lemmings, all agreeing that it wasn't faithful to Tom Wolfe's novel (as if they had all read it), that it was miscast, etc. Well, I did read the novel, and in fact it is very faithful to the novel, though it improves on it in some ways (the final scene in court is much more satisfying in the movie than in the novel). Aside from that, any movie has to take a few liberties with its source novel (Gone with the Wind eliminated dozens of minor characters and incidents that were in the book, for example). As for miscasting, Hanks probably wasn't the ideal person to play wheeler-dealer Sherman McCoy, but he does well enough, and maybe his schoolboy vulnerability was needed for this character who would be easy to hate. Melanie Griffith does fine as the rich, dopey, randy mistress Maria, though she could've used a little more coaching on her Southern accent. The casting of Bruce Willis as the slimy writer Peter Fallow more than compensates for Hanks, as Willis perfectly captures Wolfe's presentation of this boozy, failed journalist who makes his name as a "compassionate" writer by giving the public the story if wants: heartless rich white guy McCoy injures a poor black kid from the South Bronx. The truth is, the critics hated this movie because it is so un-PC. Journalists are depicted not as saintly do-gooders out to expose evil, but as selfish, lazy hacks who will gladly twist the facts to give readers a story they like. A black preacher character who is obviously modeled on Al Sharpton must've caused critics to groan, as did several other black characters who are depicted in a bad light. Rather than admit they hated the movie because it offended liberal sensibilities, critics claimed to base their distaste on the movie being unfaithful to the novel and to having some bad casting. Timing is everything. This movie was released in 1990, a time when the public in general still had a lot of respect for journalists. Between then and now we've had years of talk radio and the Internet to teach us that journalists aren't nearly as objective and righteous as they appear. So I hope this film, so perfect for our skeptical age, in time will achieve status as a cult classic, especially for people who like to thumb their noses at Political Correctness 
this movie is pretty dull and a good example of a bad film adaptation of a kind of okay book. sometimes it's laughable when it's not supposed to be, hahaha!! i laughed 
This movie got mercilessly flogged by reviewers when it was released. For that reason, I avoided it all these years. Well, that's what I get for being a sheep. This is actually a very enjoyable film. I'm sure it will continue to offend a lot of people, but what doesn't these days? I did read and like Wolfe's novel, and I really thought this was a faithful film version 
I showed this at a big party with lots and lots of kids. I was a little worried that the kids wouldn't "get" the old black and white flick, but there wan't a peep, and nobody left or lost interest. Someone else brought and showed "Captain Ron" before I put this on, which made for a great juxtoposition of values. Captain Ron was, typical of modern Hollywood, trashy and profane, while Captains Courageous was positive and uplifting. For my kids, I'd prefer the latter 
Rudyard Kipling's classic boy's tale of the sea is inhabited by Freddy Bartholomew as spoiled rich boy Harvey, Spencer Tracy as compassionate fisherman Manuel, Lionel Barrymore as good-natured Captain Disko, and Melvyn Douglas as Harvey's negligent father. Freddy Bartholomew, who received top billing in this film, is perhaps the best child actor who has ever lived, simply because he really seems to be acting rather than just looking cute. Spencer Tracy, who won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role, is one of the best adult actors of all time. As if that weren't enough, Lionel Barrymore (It's a Wonderful Life) and Melvyn Douglas (Ninotchka, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House) are two of the top character actors. And, to top it off, you've got John Carradine and Mickey Rooney in supporting roles. You can't beat the story or the cast. Victor Flemming (Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind, The Good Earth) did a superb job directing his talented cast and crew through the John Lee Mahin/Marc Connelly/Dale Van Every screenplay, which tells the story of how a spoiled rich boy, out of sorts with himself and the world, falls off a cruise ship into the sea, and is fished out by a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Once on board Manuel's fishing schooner, Harvey learns he won't be able to return to shore for three months, until the fishermen have finished their season of fishing. At first he fights his plight; but through the love and patience of Manuel, Harvey soon learns to fit in and become a contributing member of the crew. He makes mistakes; but Manuel helps him learn and eventually grow into a boy of character. This is a great father-son film. It's also a wonderful film about the sea and sailing. There are some breathtaking shots of ships, especially during a race between two schooners. There are some wonderful relationships. It's interesting to see how each adult deals with Harvey, and how each changes in that relationship as Harvey changes. One of the best scenes of the film, and the one that got to me the most, is at the very end, when Harvey is going home with his dad. First we see the dinghy in which Harvey and Manuel fished being pulled behind his dad's car. Harvey couldn't bear to part with it, so his dad brought it with them. Then the camera pans to the back of the car, where we see Harvey and his dad in the back seat through the window. Harvey is animated with enthusiasm as he is obviously telling his dad about all his adventures - even to the point of exaggerating the size of the first fish he caught. It's a great final statement about the difference an experience like that and a friend like Manuel can make in a boy's life. Waitsel Smit 
i had never seen this movie, and i dont know why! freddie bartholomew (top-billed as a teen!) is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy. over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching. a terrific olio of pathos, comedy, melodrama, and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel (which im embarrassed to admit i never read) one of the best movies ive seen. great supporting work by lionel barrymore, john carradine, mickey rooney, melvyn douglas, more. and freddie is quite the beauty here. a winner! 
Who could ever forget the image of happy-go-lucky Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle, infectious Portuguese accent, "Yo ho little fish don't cry don't cry". If you're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from Spencer Tracy's signature movie, `Captains Courageous' released in '37. Plot: Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), an Ill-mannered rich kid falls overboard off a luxury vessel and finds himself adrift until a passing merchant fishing ship pulls him out of the sea. He is taken under the tutorage of his rescuer, a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Harvey is initially hostile to the thought of having to obey orders and work for his room and board until the ship returns to dock, but eventually comes to understand the important lessons in life being imparted by Manuel. Before his adventure at sea is over he'll learn what it means to be a man. This is without a doubt my favorite Spencer Tracy film and a story the entire family will enjoy. It's beautifully filmed with a tremendous cast which includes along with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew the legendary Lionel Barrymore as Disko and John Carradine as Long Jack 
I remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people. All of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth: CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. I think it's easy to see why this is the case. The story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore, but the story of young Harvey Cheyne coming of age aboard a Gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance, people can change. On of the reasons the film works so well is the acting. Depression era child star Freddie Bartholomew plays the incorrigible Harvey. Bartholomew plays the role with great skill. He's miserable enough that we're glad when he finally falls overboard, yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued. The transformation is believable and by the films end, we begin to believe in Harvey and even grow to like him. Spencer Tracy won an Oscar as Manuel, the Portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure Harvey has ever known. Today Tracy would never get away with playing a Portuguese fisherman with his Irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent, yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed. Lionel Barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt New England sea captain Disko Troop. Mickey Rooney is somewhat underused as the captain's son Dan. My guess is that if the film were made a few years later when Rooney became a matinee idol, he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded. While a great cast carries the film, there are also smaller details that make the film powerful. The original sea shanties add a certain flavor. The special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time, and the sailing scenes are stupendous. This was no small feat in the 1930's. The film certainly is a timeless classic. People who purchase this DVD will also love the bonus features; trailers of the 1946 re-release, a short film THE LITTLE MAESTRO and a cartoon LITTLE BICK CHEESER. 
The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting. But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance. I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this. He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter. Spencer Tracy's take on a Portugeese accent is to talk in broken english. Like they used to portray the Indian's in the old westerns. It comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english, such as 'Manuel no like you. Wish you not here'. It's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making. And then there's the lack of realism. Half the time there is no one steering the ship. In real life, someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day. On this ship, no one steers at night. When the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie, in the distant shots it's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea's. But when they close in on the actors, the deck isn't moving at all. They just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond. And at the end of the movie, when Spencer Tracy's character is cut in half below the waist. He's not even in pain. He survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head. This is what really spoiled the movie. The only saving grace is Freddie Batrholomew's portrayal of Harvey 
This film is well done and Spencer Tracy shows what a superb actor he was 
Captains Courageous begins with Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), a spoiled rich kid who uses bribes and cheats his way to getting what he wants. When his father (Melvyn Douglas) finds out what his son is up to, he plans a vacation together so that his son can learn how to be a decent human being and so the two can bond. However, Harvey falls off the boat on the way and is salvaged by a Portuguese fisherman named Manuel (Spencer Tracy) who brings him aboard his fishing boat and teaches his how to be a proper man. The film is filled with sentiment, wonderful acting, and good pacing. It never gets boring; there is always something happening even if the set (the fishing boat) is limited. The cast is wonderful. Outside of Bartholomew, Douglas, and Tracy, Lionel Barrymore and Mickey Rooney grace the cast list. The film is slightly dated. There are scenes between Bartholomew and Tracy that pull at one's heart-strings, but sometimes they come off as being too close and slightly creepy, especially in a modern world of child molesters. However, taking in the time period in which the film was made and the sincerity of the actors, these cultural differences can be overlooked 
This great film will finally be available on DVD on January 31st, 2006. 
I love to watch this movie. It's one of the best movies in the 80s. I love the choreography, the music is awesome, and the characters are well-played. I wish they have this movie on DVD instead of VHS and I would hope that they'll release the soundtrack very soon. I would love to listen to it----it'll bring back memories. 
If you love dance movies, you will love this one. It is a bit cheesy on plot but the dancing is great 
I really love this movie. For those who wish to sell this movie please contact me, I would love to own this movie. This movie puts me in mind of Breakin' aka (breakdance). The messages may be a little different but the dancing is very similar. I'm just an 80's movie fan what can I say. Again, this is a great movie. You won't be disappointed! : 
This is a great movie. Some make fun of the cheesy story line but by the end of the movie you will be singing all of the songs! The dancing and choreography is so fun, you can't resist trying it yourself 
After watching this movie, i have to admit that it has become one of my sleepover classics. I make all of my friends watch it. They go home singing and dancing just as i did the first time i saw it. late night television is great for all those B movies youd never thought youd enjoy. this movie ranks as high as moulin rouge and center stage in my book. gotta love the 80's. and the dance off between the street dancers and the sandusky kids is great 
I first saw this masterpiece while on vacation with friends. Its undeniably enjoyable cheesiness captivated all 6 of us. When we got home, all of us went home and bought the movie! I watch this movie every time it comes on TV! I highly recommend this movie, especially if you are a product of the 80s. Enjoy! 
For some reason, the unabashed cheesiness and dated quality makes me enjoy this film. It's so innocent compared to today's standards. Whenever this movie would come on HBO, my eyes would be completely agog. The film is like a warped form of escapism for me. Watching 5 kids from the streets of Sandusky rise to the top in the Big Apple is just a sight for sore eyes. I love the music in the film, it's repetitive, addictive, and Fame-esque. My favorite song is at the end during the credits called "Long As We Believe." You people be sure to look out for that song because it will be a hit again. Concluding, I wouldn't recommend buying this film, but if you are ever up during the wee hours of the morning and happen to be watching cable TV, give this movie a chance 
After watching this movie, you can definitely tell why it wasn't nominated for the best movie of the year! Regardless of how extremely predictable and corny the plot is, it's actually become one of my favorites. It's a carefree, relaxing film that captures the feel and style of the 1980s. Additionally, I like this movie because it's an excellent workout. Try one of the dances and you're guaranteed to break something (hopefully a sweat but in some cases a limb or furniture) 
Cinderella has always been my favorite "Disney" Princess. A joy to watch for all ages. Glad that Disney put it on DVD! 
I love the movie! I just have one problem. I can't seem to be able to play The Royal Life from Disc 2? I put it in my computer and clicked on The Royal Life and it just gives me a summary of what it's about and then tells me to insert the dvd-rom. Does someone know how to do this 
Cinderella is the film that saved the Walt Disney Company. I don't want to tell the story because everyone knows the story of Cinderella. I highly recommand this movie. It reminds everyone of childhood 
Disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia - lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the US government, and the South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more. By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt said to himself, "What we need is a movie about a girl in trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White." That's what he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella. Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards. The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a Special Edition "extra." In some cases these photos have the animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau. In 1950, Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of Disney's famous "Nine Old Men" - at that time not yet old. Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural. Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs from Disney films before ("Heigh Ho" and "Whistle While You Work" from Snow White, "When You Wish Upon a Star" from Pinnochio, etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. "Oh, we have a hit song, well that's nice." For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1 album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today considered quintessential Disney, most notably "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" from the movie's opening scene, "The Work Song" while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown, and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year) from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene. For their best movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix. Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being "the noisiest movie ever restored" according to its audio crew.) The original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists. A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e. how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover says Cinderella is presented in its "Original Full-Screen Aspect Ratio (1.33:1)". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until 1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is 1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is "formatted to fit your television." I just wish they hadn't lied about it. Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed "Audiences like a happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too long." Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes; the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit. Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully. This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better 
A great story. Never happens in real life though. Great images, everything is very pretty. It's just one of those stories that we remember from our childhood. It's great to watch over and over again. 
"Cinderella" is an animated movie from Disney Studios that will be a family favorite to the end of civilization. The 2-disc special edition DVD actually is an edition worth having. The picture is sharp and clear and the multitude of extras has enough high spots to justify paying a bit more. Walt Disney kept the story basic, which is where the beauty of this movie lies. Cinderella lives with her step-mother, who is subtly wicked, and her two shallow, mean step-sisters. Cinderella has to take care of the house, her step-sisters and her step-mother, while dressing in rags. As we know, the house originally belonged to Cinderella's father. In spite of Cinderella's oppression, she remains upbeat and manages to thrive; somehow keeping the treatment she receives from affecting her. We also know that the king wants his son to marry because he hungers for the pitter-patter of little feet running about the castle. The king conspires to have a ball in which all the eligible maidens of the kingdom are invited. Cinderella sees a chance to have some joy in her life. Cinderella really does not care if she meets the prince; she just wants to do something other than be a handmaiden, housekeeper and cook. Cinderella's step-mother cleverly has her daughters destroy the dress made by Cinderella's animal friends, and Cinderella at last feels the despair that comes to a person held in slavery. When all hope appears lost, Cinderella's fairy godmother appears, and with a bit of bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Cinderella is ready for the ball, glass slippers, carriage and all. The ending of the story is all ready for to give us a good feeling. The magic that Walt Disney gives this film comes from the colorful imagery and the comic relief provided by a host of critters. Cinderella's main allies in this film are mice. The continuing battle between the mice and Lucifer, a cat with a disposition much like that of Cinderella's step-mother and step-sisters, allows behavior that would have been inappropriate for the character of Cinderella. The mice are permitted to voice the anguish that Cinderella usually is unable to. The animation of this 1950 film is outstanding. Remembering that each cell of this movie was hand-drawn and painted makes the achievement nothing less than incredible. The scenes involving the castle and Cinderella's costume are superb examples of hand animation at its best. This movie was nominated for seven significant awards and won four awards. There are surprises in the awards. One nomination was for the 1950 Hugo award for dramatic presentation. The Hugo awards are for science fiction, and the nomination of "Cinderella" appears somewhat a field from the intent of the award. The other surprises are that many of the nominations and awards came years and decades after the original 1950 release, including a 2005 nomination for a satellite award for this 2-disc special edition. In addition to the Disney classic are dozens of features that extend for hours. Some of the features are directly related to "Cinderella." Some, such as those from ESPN, are more of a stretch. Some of the features are interesting and enjoyable; others will be interesting to you depending on your tastes. Once upon a time Walt Disney was the source for classy animated movies. A few of these movies are timeless classics that will intrigue audiences and professionals alike. This movie is one of those. Enjoy! 
I remeber seeing this movie for the first time when I was a little girl and I feel that it is one of disneys best animated classics ever.I bought it for my 2 little girls and they not only watch it everyday but they love to dress up as cinderella while watching it.It has been excellently restored and the special features are great.Absolutely a must have for anyone who has little girls!!!! 
Does anyone know when and if this title is going back into the Disney vault????? Please e-mail me: anthony2004@earthlink.net Thank you very much 
Now on a Two Disc DVD, Walt Disney's Masterpiece "Cinderella" now fully restored to new enchanting brilliance. The legendary animated film is packed with alots of bonus features, I love Disney, so this is a great film. The Beloved story of a widowed man's daughter named Cinderella who is forced to live with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters after her father's death, living as a low status girl doing maid work all time with only delightful mice for friends, but her luck changes when a royal ball is annouced by the king for his son, Prince Charming to meet the girl of his dreams and with a fairy godmother and a left behind glass slipper, Cinderella and Charming live happily ever after. It's a landmark film in animation, it's a delight for all ages, they don't make em like they used to. See Walt Disney's "Cinderella

La descripcion de la pelicula en la pagina es muy exacta. Estaq edicion especial es de verdad especial 
Very helpful read for anyone that has lost a child 
If you are looking for the academic lecture video by this same title (the one hour lecture delivered at UNC), this isn't it. This is a shorter video, with a pragmatic focus on individual persons and families dealing with catastrophic loss. A good primer for health care workers, but does not have the broad academic, philosophic, and theological applications that the earlier lecture video has 
I wish more people could see that their humanity in the world rather than try to be God, or relentlessly seek answers when none exist. This is a brilliant discourse on the sadder parts of the human experience. Rather than try to alleviate pain by trying to find out why a tragedy happened, etc ... it is often more healing to also see the humanity of an event when no real explanation is possible. Bad things happen to good people and vice-versa. This world is complex and simple at the same time. But most of all, this book is a blessing against the current wave of New Age blame game mumbo jumbo... The New Age (distinct from metaphysical teachings from ancient wisdom) is the serpent in the tree with the poison apple. It is the taking of ancient spiritual teachings and commercializing them as false prophets for profit. Allow people there humanity just like what the author of this book is doing. And perhaps authentic healing can occur 
This book is an easy and enjoyable read about a difficult philosophical topic. It deals with the practical reality of the exisence of evil and ties it to a combination of random chance and people's free will. That is the underlying thesis and deep philosophical arguments are avoided. What this book does have is practical wisdom and common sense arguments. I think this is what the average reader is looking for and Rabbi Kushner achieves this gold within a Judeo-Christian worldview. However, his arguments would appeal to people of many traditions. At a minimum, the text would be good food for those who embrace vastly different worldviews. I rated this book a 4 rather than 5 primarily because I would have liked to have seen a bit more philosophical depth. However, I still think the book is well worth reading for all of the reasons I mention above. This is high quality, but not the right book to weigh various perspectives and contast them 
Heard the taped version of WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE by Harold Kushner, a Jewish rabbi . . . although written some 25 years ago, it is still amazingly relevant . . . and, in fact, it was reissued in 2001 with a new preface by the author. Kushner originally wrote the book when faced with his own child's fatal illness . . . it deals with death and, also, with other situations where evil enters our life . . . though it gives no easy answers, WHEN BAD THINGS got me thinking about with this one particular bit of advice . . . he urges people not to ask why all the time, but instead ask this question: What can I do now? What Kushner has to say applies to people of all religious faiths . . . I urge you to get a copy of this short book . . . like me, you'll want to go through it more than once. There were many worthwhile tidbits; among them: * God never gives you more than you can bear. * We can't make sense of God's thoughts by saying it is God's will. * Things of nature don't make exceptions for good people. * We suffer because we misuse our power to choose. * God intervenes when in a tragedy, he takes ordinary people and has them behave in an extraordinary way. * If you know somebody who has been hurt, reach out to him or her. * People don't want theology, they want reassurance. * When we most need it, God gives us more strength. * You have no control of the past. You have a lot of control over the future. And, lastly, this one: God has given us the tools to live meaningfully in an unfair and unpredictable world. 
Excellent! I gave this book to my sister who lost her granddaughter to cancer and she said it provided the most help of all. Thanks so much 
This is the least preachy bible study I've ever read. Kushner divides his chapters by themes and suggests, but does not demand, a theological answer which supports his thesis: that an all-knowing God can server the cause of good yet not function as a safety belt. He supports it with elements from his own experience. Since his language is comforting and conversational, anyone can relate to him as a speaker. Well worth it! 
This book is so easy to read it is as if you are having a conversation with a close friend. I was so inspired by this book, I am ordering many more to pass along 
I singled out this book as I felt I'd come to a fork in the road of my life. I could choose to be bitter after the premature birth and death of my son or I could try to seek out better ways to live my now very different life. I started this book dubious of its content. I expected to be lectured. Instead I found myself reading with an open mouth; shocked at how accurately my loss was explained. It was as if this wonderfully gifted rabbi had invisibly witnessed the events of my life, the times when my relatives would say the dumbest and most cruel comments. Instead of being talked at, I found I was reading a book a kind friend had written just for me. I am not religious or spiritual, I guess you could say I'm confused, however his book has opened my eyes to a different, kinder religion than the one I had always felt was judgemental. I have since purchased the anniversary edition and this book will be one of my most treasured possessions. If you feel life has let you down, if you feel every door that was once open has been slammed in your face, if you feel alone in your sorrow and have nowhere else to turn for relief, this book is for you. It won't make the pain go away, but it will make the pain and sorrow less personal. You will no longer feel `why me', you will just realize that it is what it is and that in itself will make your pain easier to cope with. This is certainly how I feel upon it's ending, I hope you experience the same comforts 
ANDROMEDA STRAIN WAS A GRATE MOVIE IF YOU LIKE THE OLDER SCIFI MOVIES. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET I WOULD RECOMEND YOU SEE IT. IT DOES GET LONG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE BUT BY THE END OF IT THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTION. GREAT FOR ALMOST ALL AGES THAT LIKE AND ENJOY OLDER SCIFI MOVIES 
I remember watching this film when it first came out in a theatre in Manhattan Beach, California. [During a time when you got two films for the price of one] I remember how fascinating the film was, and wondering if microbes were that bad. Not understanding everything the film discussed, I did know that something terrible had happened in a town in New Mexico. Everybody but a baby and an old man had been killed. But why did these two humans survive? [No Spoilers] Moreover, when the Doctors who are assembled at a secret bio-hazard facility, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force, try and figure out what danger Earth is in due to this new microbe, I sat riveted to my seat. I was thrilled at how the directors and special effects people were able to make a film that even a young teenager could enjoy. In their race to contain a microbe that has been picked up by a satellite falling back to earth, the actors as scientists in the film created an atmosphere of suspense and dread that stayed with me even after I had left the theatre with my older brothers. The way in which the film is handled is intelligent. There is no silly dialogue and used up time. These scientists make you feel as if the entire human race is going to be determined by either their success or failure. And that is why this film has stood the test of time. There is no CGI in this film, yet when you see the microbe and the computer systems at work, you get a feeling that this is really happening. At least it felt that way as a young boy. This film is highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5 
Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme. It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither). The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic. But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst. This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.) If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension. I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way. I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud. 
From the other reviewers you already know it is about some foreign piece of bio-hazard that lands in this small town in New Mexico killing everyone but two people. But the question is... why is this old move based on a story by Michael Crichton so good? There are many sci-fi movies. We know why Jurassic Park was a hit. It was the first time someone thought of taking DNA and then re-created pre-historic dinosaurs - and then it was all done in fabulous beautiful color with special effects and helicopter shots and scenes in the rain. But this movie does not have that. Andromeda Strain is in black and white about a small group of people and dominated mainly by Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) and Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) locked underground in this small laboratory trying to figure out what is this biohazard (exactly) and how can they control it. They use various gadgets including scanning electron microscopes etc. all dressed in white lab coats - the stereotypical scientists, never entertaininng people!! My take on it is that it has a certain feel like the "Twilight Zone" where you really do not know if this investigation will succeed or suddenly go terribly wrong. It leaves you glued to the movie (TV). In fact it turns out that the "thing" is not from our world. It grows when it is radiated and they almost have a disaster blow up in their face. It is all just very suspenseful and well executed, i.e.: good acting and directing, with enough technical stuff to make it seem credible. 5 Stars 
If you enjoy scientific investigation, a slow paced scenario, and mystery, this movie is a total success. I was riveted on my seat from beginning to end. Splendid. Not a movie for action-lovers or brainless jerks 
"Andromeda Strain" is based on the first major novel by Michael Crichton (author of "Jurassic Park," et al). It reaps the benefits of "2,001: A Space Odyssey," in the sense that science fiction movies back then started to become big budget and could be taken seriously. Significantly, David Wise ("The Day the Earth Stood Still") directs, and a good ensemble was chosen to act out the roles. The story is about a mass invasion, but instead of tangible beings appearing like "War of the Worlds," we get some sort of disease, instead. (Perhaps, then, it is the inverse of the H. G. Wells' classic.) There are innovations of technical achievement that make this movie worthwhile from the start. The movie is detailed, yet engaging throughout. It seldom gets too technical, and it seldom matters if one misses the boat regarding all of the facts presented. The explanations are mainly meant to give the story a plausible execution. The tension ebbs and flows in an effective way, mostly from the fine acting performances, which are credible and entertaining throughout. The strife between four expert scientists (Arthur Hill, David Wayne, Kate Reid, and Jimmy Olson) and the tension of their task is tangible. (Reid's performance as the acerbic Dr. Ruth Levit is particularly funny and sharp.) Their gathering, called upon during biological crises, is central to the movie's success. The timing and music also create a genuine atmosphere of crisis. Otherwise, the story unfolds like a detective mystery with clues appearing quickly along the way. While it may seem to some that it is a fanciful concept to acquire new biological life forms without the usual characteristics that our life forms have, there is enough suspension of our disbelief to make the adventure worthwhile. The extras are particularly good for a DVD. The technical explanations regarding the movie's creation are almost as detailed as the scientific ones given in the movie. The interviews are stimulating, although extras on DVD's always have the effect of going back behind the stage after a magic show. It is a mixed blessing: One's curiosity is satisfied at the expense of revealing the effect of the magic. Nevertheless, the extras are awesome. Michael Crichton and Robert Wise are featured, and both are very articulate and resourceful at explaining their crafts 
It is nice to find a movie that believes that its viewers have an IQ over 60. Hollywood doesn't make enough of these types of movies. The movie itself is quite thrilling. The last half an hour actually has you sitting on the edge of your seat. I found it to be quite entertaining and well worth checking out. The acting wasn't the best, but I've most definately seen worst. It was refreshing for the director to choose several "no name" actors so that we can enjoy the progress of the story and not be distracted by celebrities. It added a lot of realism to the movie. The best part about the DVD was the makeing-of feature. It is amazing how much was done with the lack of technology that Hollywood has now. It was even interesing how they had killed their monkey. If you enjoy the movie I highly suggest you check out the feature as well. It is only half an hour long but I had wished it could have been longer and more detailed 
I liked this movie when it first came out.Most of the reveiws on this site gave it problems.Movies of this sort do.This is a SciFi movie from the 70's.What is the problem?Just get over it and enjoy. 
If you're looking for exciting chase scenes, gratutious nudity, explicit sex scenes, and formulaic mega-spectacle, then this one is not for you. But, you will love this movie if you love dance, dancers, searchers for true love, cynics whom true love find, oddballs who find their one true soul mate, and good guys who win in the end. All in one underrated and underreviewed masterpiece. Ignore the naysayers. Take a chance and see this one. Share it with someone you love. You will not regret it 
It isn't great drama, but all in all it is interesting. Craig Ferguson is great in it, he even sings. He make the whole film worth watching. 
This was a fun movie! Salsa lovers will relate. New Salsa lovers will really relate 
I love this film (obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot), to me it's the quintessential Brit flick - absolutely what we do best - but I don't consider it a Rom Com at all. It's very bitter sweet, and if all you're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you're missing the point of this film. Every character had a dark thread running through them, a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made. But it's also about hope, and the message that I get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past, you can always overcome them or redeem yourself. Adrian Lester was, as always, wonderful at the emotional epi-centre of the film. BTW if you ever get the chance to see him do Shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go, he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween'. So, my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film 
Hubby and I have finally solved our problem of being unable to understand English accents that are other than what one hears on the BBC and are referred to as "posh" or upperclass. We now turn on the English subtitles and watch them that way. It used to be that fifteen minutes into a movie like this we'd be turning it off because we had such trouble understanding them. With the advent of English subtitles being on all DVDs, those days are over. The film is a relationship film set in London and involves rougly 7 different men and women and their attempts to get together through the use of their local Salsa dance club. Every character in here has relationship problems but they tend to be funny ones. There is minimal contact with the world of divorce and even less with the world of single parenting. Instead, these are all singles trying to connect and flopping fabulously at it most of the time. Each character has his or her own eccentricity which is well handled too. I can't say I need to own this film but for an evening's viewing, it was a lot of fun. There are two men who play cab drivers in a restaurant who have some absolutely hilarious dialogues with one another. They aren't part of the other action but as comedy sketches, their scenes together are gems 
BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types. And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive. The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue. One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male. The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing. A lovely film full of surprises 
You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good. This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny. The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked. I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks). That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people. This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either). Recommended 
i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it. i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce. this film combines humor, romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly. i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony. i can't wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection. a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways 
my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl's moving castle. it has the same kind of story and if you like how�'s moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too 
My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital. The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum. Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind. This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required. My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2. (Causing them to buy a number of other Ghibli films) Highly recommended 
Family movies don't get much better than this. No double-entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable. Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch. There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good "friendly spirit" movie. Kids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie. Adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with (and get a chuckle out of) several conversations between parents and their children. This is one of those movies from which you will get the "warm fuzzies." Share it with others in your family 
A good animated film, with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations. It also protrays children's ready acceptance of unusual or supernatural. The father's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming 
My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she's only one year old. Not to mention that my husband and I saw the movie first and decided we had to buy it for her. We have watched and enjoyed it many times. 
The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off! I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please! 
My wife, 4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me. He said it was a great family movie. It didn't sound that interesting so I didn't purchase it right away. Finally, one day when I saw a link about it on Amazon, I decided to go for it. We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it. We have since collected 5 of Miazaki, and Studio Ghibli's films, and we plan to purchase more in the future. BTW, if you like this, also check out "Wisper of the Heart", another great Studio Ghibli film. Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie 
This is an excellent movie for all ages! Get it now. Experience the magic. Wonderful story, acting, and attitude sets this movie from all others 
My Neighbor Totoro is a simply wonderful story. It portrays innocence and family love at its best and is very delightful to watch. 
Even though this was one of Prince's underrated movies, I still love it. The DVD version includes all of the music videos (some in color) that were released in reference to the soundtrack. This was ingenious for the marketability of this DVD. Way to go 
This movie isn't as good as Purple Rain and the music is just okay but I love the scene with the song "Kiss" and I LOVE this movie. It's so funny and it's cute. And Prince is hott! 
I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986. Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack. And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days. Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip. They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself. It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy. Of course, poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a movie popular. Yet "Under the Cherry Moon" was a bomb at he box office. Probably the main reason for this is that the movie, although shot in color, was released in black-and-white. For some unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves. I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color. I will acknowledge that this movie's target audience is Prince fans. Since I am one myself, and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely objective viewer. But I make no apologies for my love of this movie. It's not a "guilty pleasure" for me, because I proudly hold this as one of my favorites. I had only seen it a couple times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see "Grafitti Bridge" on opening night, but that's for another review). But since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection. The soundtrack is KILLER, the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever. There's even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the album (some of which was issued on 12" vinyl). Plus, I think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics). I wonder how the movie would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right way to go. Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times, it has the feel of something from the '30s. There are so many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all. But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his "Bela Lugosi eyes"...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the "Wreka Stow" scene...the car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott Thomas). As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying that Prince's performance was no good. I don't see much truth in that claim. After being so serious in "Purple Rain," it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this. Jerome Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at his side (as in "Purple Rain") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done much additional acting outside of Prince movies. And obviously Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady. How is the DVD presentation? Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked movie. The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and sounds fine. As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown Special Edition like the 2-disc "Purple Rain" will be disappointed. But at least it's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes). The highlight is the live performance of "anotherlover" which was taken from a never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting the Parade tour. MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird) contest to determine where "Under the Cherry Moon" would have it's world premiere. The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in their hometown. MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of "Purple Rain" unfortunately this program is not to be found on "Under the Cherry Moon"'s DVD release. Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere. When asked what he thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a single word: "Purple." 
1st of all if you are a Prince fan, then it is ofcourse the norm, that you have some favortism directed to the film. That would be me included!!! Does he ever not look good on camera??? I love his hair styles throughout the movie. O.K. now on the movie itself; I find the plot of it beautiful. I wish it did; however, show more erotic love scenes. I love the idea of this movie pertaining to the fact to w/ being a male gigolo, and finding love. THIS IS A PRINCE FILM that does not come on to often...this is simply beautiful B so clean looking. (...)! to all the naysayers, because Graffiti Bridge is sexy too! This could be a silent film, and I would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute (...)on screen...everything about him is art. More than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he: An animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch...cut it out you haters he is GORGEOUS!! 
Whether people like him or not, there's no doubting that this man is a musical genius! He started his career as a rock star aiming his music towards white teens but everyone of all races and ages was curious as to who this little man was. When he realized how much attention he could get from people just by being different, he figured why not try different things like movies. If you're from the '80's then you have at least seen 2 out of the three movies that were made and you owned at least one album. I loved him then and still do today, and I'm not alone, I've been to his recent sold out concerts. Don't hate because he's different, learn to embrace and appreciate the differences! 
Prince's 1986 romantic comedy "Under the Cherry Moon" finally received the DVD treatment it deserved in the Summer of 2004. When the film was released, it was bombarded with bad reviews but this film is actually decent. Of course the music stands out but it actually succeeds as a comedy. The acting may be full of flaws but it's the 80's, what do you expect? Prince and Jerome Benton , from The Time, are gigolos living it up in South France and they come across a beautiful heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas) who happens to get her trust fund on her 21st birthday. They both woo her for the money but Prince ends up catching feelings for her. With a beautifully filmed movie and an incredible soundtrack, "Under the Cherry Moon" fails to disappoint 
As popular as Prince was in the 80's, it's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for Under The Cherry Moon to find it's way to DVD. Critics largely considered the film a stinker, especially considering it was only two years behind Purple Rain, but Under The Cherry Moon was a very good film, although very different than Purple Rain. Shot in black and white, Under The Cherry Moon starred Prince as Christopher Tracey, him and his buddy Tricky (Jerome Benton from The Time) are living it up in Europe. They wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money, basically they are gigolos. They swear it never gets personal until Mary Sharon comes into the picture. Christopher falls for Mary in a big way, but her father Issac Sharon isn't having it. Drama ensues. The soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs "U Need Another Lover Like You Need a Whole In Your Head," "Mountain," and "Kiss" and the DVD includes the videos for the songs shot for the film. A must have for Prince fans. 
I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole 
Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge." But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
Terriffic Movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt 
This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that. I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry. My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other. This scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film. Although it's the last time that Mitch ever sees Morrie alive, it's still very sweet and poignant. The ending is pretty sad, but it's also happy at the same time. Morrie is gone, yet his legacy lives on. I recommend this movie to anyone, of any gender, of any age. 
This movie was so very well done, and so very sad. It will reach-around from behind you and pleasure you in a way you didn't expect, but will leave you feeling very sad at the end. Sad, but inspired - and that is what this movie is about. Inspiration. Morrie was a great, stand-up character who was always "pitching a tent", so to speak. I highly recommend this movie 
This is an excellent story about what life is really all about. The book and DVD make excellent gifts too. I highly recommend both products! 
 The film exhibition as the act of dying can be lived with love and people that love each other enter, creating a protection atmosphere, of support, of peace. Morrie gives us a life lesson in the death 
I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen 
This movie makes you think about things we don't think about everyday.... life, death, and what's important. Defintiely an eye-opener... deep and emotional at times. 
I had read the book first befoe viewing the TV movie and to tell you the truthe i couldn't tell which came first: the chicken (movie) or the egg (book) Jack Lemon and the rest of the cast were suberb 
It took me all of 4 hours to read this book. It was insightful and entertaining. It was also sad. I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours. I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever 
...Profound. Nothing short of an algorithm of life's past, present, and future ignorance and faux pas. It has a wide eyed view on what is real, and depicts life in all it's glory and gloom. Each role will tell you somethings we all should know, but were never, and will never be taught. A rare retrospect of wisdom captured in film. A strong allusion of humor and melancholy. 
I discovered this film by accident while reading a black cinema history book by Donald Bogle. I was fascinated by the movie once I saw it. It's become one of my favorites. This is an art house film about a wealthy white man who becomes a landlord of a Brooklyn tenament and makes connections with two very different black women. I love the boldness and complexity of the film and the directing was dreamy and odd--making it a surreal visual experience. I was captivated, as usual, by the spectacular performance of the late, great superior Diana Sands, who died too soon: I think she would have been one of Hollywood's biggest black actresses had she lived. She is mesmerizing in this film. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in movies that explore race relations and the complexities of human relationships. 
A rich, sharply observed social satire that proceeds from farce to tragedy with logic and integrity. What a pleasure. Although Hal Ashby, first-time director, and Gordon Willis, almost as new to feature cinematography, deserve the highest praise for their contributions, I split the lion's share of credit for the film's success between Bill Gunn's biting, hilarious script and the perfectly cast ensemble: Beau Bridges is deceptively nuanced in a deceptively tough role: Elgar Enders, an unmarked, unformed trust-funder whose scheme of renovating a tenement house into a groovy bachelor pad is his trial by fire waiting to happen. His relentless lessons in humility would be exhausting if they weren't leavened with (dark) humor. Had Bridges chewed some scenery, he might have garnered an Oscar. As it is, he opts for a bewildered spontaneity that sure looks like great acting to me. Elgar's mother Joyce (Lee Grant) and Marge (Pearl Bailey), a tenant in Elgar's building, have a lengthy, hilarious scene over bottle after bottle of fortified wine that would be a comic touchstone if only more people knew about the movie. Observes Marge: "You can get at those hamhocks a little better if you take those gloves off, honey." Diana Sands as Fanny Copee is flat out hilarious when the script calls for it (Broadly pouting, having sussed what a light touch Elgar is: "Complaints? Well let's see... The roof leaks, the oven door's broke, the toilet runs all day, and you're awful cute to be a landlord..."), equally wrenching when the script calls for that. Marki Bey offers a lived-in performance as Lanie, another of Elgar's romantic intrigues: Lanie is sad, serious, but not despairing. Watch the "Spinal Meningitis Festival Ball" scene closely- she's given almost no dialogue, but her reactions supply all the eloquence required: joy, apprehension, tenderness. Lou Gossett is first seen embodying The White Man's nightmare version of The Urban Black Male, but it's a put-on. Still, the film plumbs the pain behind the role-playing, and finally it's clear that the pain is bottomless: ("D-don't let them transplant my heart til I'm dead," he pleads, his mind finally snapped). Mel Stewart is the droll, menacing Prof. Dubois, another of Elgar's tenants, who would despise Elgar if such a feeling weren't beneath him. Stingingly aloof as he is, the professor delivers the jab to Elgar's conscience that helps end the film on a hopeful note. "The Landlord" impresses first with its wit, then with the seriousness of its intentions. 
I agree- they DON'T make 'em like this anymore- honest, bold, uncompromising, socially and politically meaningful... yet (lest we forget) ENTERTAINING. Like Stanley Kubrick,the late Hal Ashby didn't direct a whole lot of films, but most of them were built to last ("Harold &amp; Maude", "The Last Detail", "Being There", "Shampoo"). "The Landlord" was Ashby's impressive directorial debut in 1970. Spoiled rich kid Beau Bridges, worrisome to his parents due to his "liberal views", buys a run-down tenement building with intentions to rennovate. His introduction to, and subsequent involvement with, the various black tenants is played sometimes for laughs, sometimes for intense drama, but always for real, and that's the magic of Ashby's work. The social satire is dead-on, but never preachy (are you listening, Spike Lee?). The ensemble work is top-notch, with a young Lou Gossett (with hair!) giving a memorable dramatic turn, and the lovely Susan Anspach hilarious as Bridges' perpetually stoned and bemused sister. The scene in which Pearl Bailey and Lee Grant (two more knockout performances) get drunk and bond over a bottle of "sparkling" wine is a minor classic all on its own. Don't miss this one 
Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Ann Miller, Tommy Roll, Bob Fosse, Carol Haney, Keenan Wynn, James Whitmore, and music by Cole Porter. "nuff said. Brush up your Shakespeare!!! 
This is one of my favourite musicals (along with Seven Brides for SEven brothers). A great good natured movie which followed a hugely successful Broadway show of the same name. Cole Porter's amusing songs set on the background of a stage musical based around Shakespeare's taming of the shrew. In the background are the ex husband and wife (Fred and Lilli - played by Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel) who are reliving their own version of Katherine and Petruchio as they figure out their own failed marriage This is not a difficult film to watch emotionally, as you can imagine Cole Porter is not Oprah Wingrey. However it is enormoulsy good natured, I love Porter's clever lyrics and Howard Keel and Grayson are extremely good in their roles, A neat supporting cast. There are a few stretches in some of the songs - I mean how on earth could they really imagine that 'Wunderbar' would be a great song for a shakespearian play set in Italy? Still it fits in and it is fun to watch just how they manage it - and as for teh two gangsters singing, 'Brush up your Shakespeare' rhyming Heinous with Coriolanus! There are really no extras on this at all - if you hoped for an interview or deleted scenes then forget it, it is the movie, and a few picture scenes with a bit of information on them, nothing that you would want to buy this DVD especially for. One of the best musicals, lots of fun and a good watch 
Some of the re-writes for this movie are a bit hard to take. While the new opening is a little hard to take, it does establish the animosity between Fred and Lily quite well. It also makes "Too darned hot" acceptable. Censored lyrics are not awful, but they rob Porter of some of his depth. Katherine Grayson rises to the occasion quite well. Her early scene is contrived, but after that she's on firm footing. Howard Keel is wonderful. His acting is just a tad square, but that was in part the format of the time. Ann Miller dances up a storm. And, speaking of dancing, what a treat to have Carol Haney, Bob Fosse and Bobby Van as featured dancers. There isn't really a complete rendition of "Another openin', another show" and "Bianca" is cut entirely. But the rest of the numbers come through great. Why 4 stars? Partially because of the cuts. But also the color has just a little fluctuation at times. This isn't a restored print, but it isn't bad either. I wish they had a few more of the 3-D excerpts in the Special stuff. I also with they sent some 3-D glasses. 
I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall). Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film. Then I noticed the cover. I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'. YIKES! It is! I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!). If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it. Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
When two squabbling ex-marrieds are cast as squabbling Renanaissance romantics in a musical "The Taming Of the Sherew 1952" , life imitates art , art imitates life -and it all proves no musical comedy imitates KISS ME KATE , the backstage / onstage delight from the 1948 Broadway smash and featuring 14 peerles Cole Porter (1891-1964) songs . Howard Keel (1919-2004) and Kathryn Grayson (1922- ) are the tangeled twosome So in Love despite her i hate men flashpoints . Ann Miller (1923-2003) adds heat , razzle-tap-dazzling .Zesty Choreography by Bob Foss (1927-1987) and Hermes Pan (1909-1990) Under George Sidney (1916-2002) nible direction . So brush up your Shakespeare and Enjoy . Kaste wont just Kiss you . Shell floor you !. DVD includes vintage documentary shorts : Mighty Manhattan and New Yorks Wonder city , the pure digital transfer in high resolution and enjoy both movies . Highly recommende 
Directed by George Sidney with all the color and verve befitting a top-shelf MGM production, "Kate" re-teamed Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson after their successful turn together in the studio's Technicolor re-make of "Showboat" (1951). The pair never hit a false note playing off each other, with Keel's manly bearing and baritone complementing Grayson's feminine but fiery persona and expressive soprano voice. With its ingenious story of romantic shenanigans on and off the stage, "Kiss Me Kate" remains irresistible entertainment 
I'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand - you receive one of the greatest MGM musicals ever conceived and it's bolstered by quite nice extras. That much you can be assured of. I'm writing this particular review because of Warner Bros. insistance on using fragile, cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases. The problem with these Warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case, rendering it's capability the actually hold the disc useless. And unlike the plastic cases, the Warner ones cannot be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer (good luck with that, by the way). Another problem lies with the fact that it's made out of cardboard - when you remove the anti-theft stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover. This can occur even when you're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off. The reason I feel the need to mention this is I own dozens of Warner movies, and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one (not likely, Greedy Bros.) To be fair, Warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases - the top-notch Film Noir and Gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases. But titles like "Kiss Me Kate", "Rebel Without A Cause", "Broadway Melody of 1940", and even "Wizard of Oz" are still only available in these sad cardboard cases. 
This is by far one of the very best musicals ever made. Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel displays Oscar worthy performances as Lilli and Fred. Sadly, this was Grayson`s last MGM film and she did only 1 more(at Paramount - The Vagabond King with Oreste). In KISS ME KATE she shows us a depth and nuance and is right on target the whole picture through. Audrey Hepburn won that year`s Oscar for Roman Holiday - but Miss Grayson should deservedly have won it. The same goes for Howard Keel. True, he is hammy at times - but it is a remarkable performance he gives(Mind u - he was a musical star). William Wolden`s Oscar for Stalag 17 should have gone to Mr Keel. That`s Entertainment and its sequels payed deservedly homage to producer Arthur Freed and his genius in selecting and delegating crew and performers to the right project were uncanny. Yet you shouldn`t negletct Jack Cummings who produced this film, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers and Three Little Words(to name but a few). It seems to me that MGM had an "MGM-look!" Can u really tell the MGM films from 1930-1960 apart and say which 1 was the director? Not really, unless u are Hitchcock or Fritz Lang. What I mean to say that it`s high time Cummings, Joe Pasternak og Sol C. Sigel comes out of the cold and are giving honours for their splendid musical efforts(Bathing Beauty, Anchors Aweigh, In the Good Old Summertime, Summer Stock, The Great Caruso, Hit The Deck and High Society etc). I must also pay may respects to Tommy Rall(soon 2 be one of the brothers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers); he is a dancer`s dream come true:- 
This was an excellent video. It gave me many useful tools in correcting bad behavior in my dogs. It was easy to follow and Dr. Dunbar has a wonderful sense of humor. 
Cannes Man was funny. I don't know why this movie was in the drama section of Blockbuster, but it made me laugh out loud. Just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland, and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who don't know their **s from a hole in the ground 
I've been to Cannes and this film captures it to a T. If you're looking for a Johnny Depp film, this isn't it - he does a ten minute cameo in it with Jim Jarmusch. But it's the funniest ten minutes I've ever seen Johnny Depp be. If you are interested in film festivals, or wanted to know what the real Cannes festival is like, this video is hilarious 
"All In The Family" was certainly a ground-breaking TV show, and the episodes selected for this VHS video will give you a pretty good idea as to why that was true. Archie Bunker, in all his bigoted splendor, comes to life right away in the premiere episode of the series, entitled "Meet The Bunkers" (first aired in January of 1971). In addition to that first episode, this tape also gives us another Season-One program (Episode # 8), "Lionel Moves Into The Neighborhood", and a show from Season Two, "Flashback: Mike Meets Archie" (which was the 18th episode in the series). This 1998-produced color video from Columbia Tri-Star Home Video is presented (for some odd reason that I've yet to fathom) in "EP" (Extended Play) mode. (Well, at least the copy that I received is in EP mode; perhaps some other copies *were* recorded in SP; I cannot be sure of this.) But this EP recording makes no sense to me at all, since all 70 minutes could easily fit on the tape's spool in "SP" (Standard) playback mode, and give better quality to boot. It also seems strange that Columbia has produced some of the tapes in this series of 10 "All In The Family" videos in SP mode, while others (like this one) are recorded at the inferior EP speed. Most curious indeed. But, even so, the video and audio look and sound pretty good here, considering the limitations of the VHS format. In fact, the Hi-Fi Mono sound on this tape actually sounds *better* than the audio on any of the multiple AITF boxed sets on DVD. The DVD's audio tracks seem a tad "weak" to me. Completists beware! --- These Columbia/Tri-Star videos of "AITF" are NOT showing the complete, uncut episodes. Some large chunks of programming have been edited out of this video, and others in this series too. Which, again, seems strange, because there are no commercial interruptions here, and obviously no need to trim anything for time reasons. But, obviously, Columbia has used truncated, syndicated prints for these "All In The Family" videos. An example of missing scenes --- In the first episode on this tape, the final 2 to 3 minutes of the Epilog scene are missing (when Archie and Mike/Meathead are talking about the greeting card that Edith received earlier in the episode). It *is*, indeed, all just "filler", without much substance, but it would still be nice to see the shows uncut. If you desire to see the complete, unedited shows, you'll have to purchase the seasonal boxed sets of "All In The Family" on DVD. The DVDs do present the shows in uncut form, which is great to see, because there are some often-excised scenes shown on the DVDs that you've probably never seen before, due to the chopped-up prints shown on commercial TV. Smile-inducing dialogue courtesy Mr. Archie Bunker in "Meet The Bunkers" .................. Archie (talking to daughter Gloria): "Pull that skirt down! ...... Every time you sit down in one of them things, the mystery's over!" LOL 
My husband and I are major fans of All in the Family. There is not and episode that we did not cry laughing. There is so much to be learned from this show. I've heard some say what a crude man Archie was, but I could always see the good in him and how Edith was the perfect partner for him. I know I talk of them as if they were real. But to me they are and they will live on in my heart forever. This was and is a very special special show, and I hope that all the seasons come out soon on DVD/Video, because I want to collect them all. I have only the first and second season. I am hoping that they will be coming out with the rest of the seasons in the VERY NEAR future. Sincerely, One of your many #1 fans!! 
"All In The Family" Is 1 Of The Best Sitcoms Ever. On This Cassatte It Has Lional From The Spinoff "The Jeffersons". Archie Meets His Future Son-In-Low Mike "The Meathead". Gloria And Mike Put On A Anniversiry Party For Edith And Archie, Lional From "The Jeffersons" Visits The Bunker House, And Gloria And Mike Celebrate Their Wedding Anniversiry. This Is A Funny Tape. You Must Buy It 
He said that it is mostly filled with advertisements for boats and fishing equipment and rambling talking by his director 
My dog is doing almost everything that they show on this DVD and he is only 10 months old. Even if you dont want to hunt, you should get this DVD for your retriever. The best part of my dogs day is working on the things shown in this DVD, and It has made taking him places with us a lot easier as well. We all have benifited from this DVD 
I think this is a great beigners viedo for someone who is just starting to train thier reteriev 
Richard A. Wolters was a longtime friend who died in 1993. Dick was founder of the North American Hunting Retriever Association (NAHRA). I campaigned Labs with him and used his training technique to develop wonderful hunting companions. Anyone interested in owning and hunting with a first class retriever will benefit from Wolters' training tips, videos and books. A good retriever is an important wildlife conservation tool. You will add further to your enjoyment by joining NAHRA to work with other retrievers and retriever owners. Good hunting and great success 
This video was absolutely wonderful and a whole lotta fun to watch. It was great to see so many legends perform their timeless hits. I loved to see The Four Tops, Somokey The Miracles and everyone else that was featured. The only problem I had with this video though was I really would have loved to see more of my all time faves..... those Temptin' Temptations 
This video only begins to demonstrate the influence that Detroit artists have had on modern music. How many commercials, tv shows, and movie films used motown songs?? This is a rather short video, but worthwhile if you are old enough to remember the tiny B tv screens, and one small, tinny speaker in the cabinet, that we watched and listened to!!    
In this film you get to see more then The Temptations and The Supremes, you get to see Junior Walker and The All Stars, The Four Tops, Martha and The Vadellas performing their number 1 hits, I wish they would do more films like this showing rare clips of the Motown artists. The Motown artist back in the 60s, were the hardest working performers in the 60s. Hopefully in the future we'll see more like this 
I enjoyed the video...however...I was hoping for more of the Temptations...also, I would have preferred seeing the groups (especially my favorite - The Temptations- on the stage without the "stands" that really restricted their being able to do their fancy "moves"...If anyone knows of any VHS's that include the Temptations on stage I'd like to know about them. My other disappointment is the short time (approx 30 min) of the entire program 
I recommend this video. It is short, but definitely packed full of good footage of the fabulous Four Tops, the show stopping Supremes(you can tell Flo is not happy in the video so I think this footage is close to the split between her and the Supremes), the temptin Temptations, Motor City's Martha and the Vandellas, jivin Junior Walker and his All Stars, and the one and only macdaddy Marvin Gaye himself. Buy it and enjoy 
British producer Jack Good had an idea for a music show he wanted to launch in the States: the show would encompass performers from various fields of music and showcase them in the best and most exciting manner. Thus one show had the Hondells, Bobby Sherman the Blossoms, of course AND Clara Ward and her gospel singers! Motown also was a great part of the Shindig! mix. This edition will treat you to a young Mary Wells singing "My Guy" with The Blossoms and The Wellingtons backing her up. The Temptin' Temptations perform a live (not lip-synced) version of "My Girl" that obviously had a lot of girls in the audience revved up as they can be heard screaming joyously! Martha Reeves and the Vandellas perform a sizzling version of "Nowhere to Run" and the Four Tops whirl through a kinetic "It's the Same Old Song." I'm sure you'll dig the Supremes as you'll see 'em standing high while performing a fantastic "Stop! in the Name of Love," which was the Shindig! Pick Hit of the Week! Also, Marvin Gaye delivers princely deliveries of "How Sweet It Is," (one of the most elegant performances I've come across) and the exciting "Can I Get a Witness." If there is any justice, Rhino will put out more of these tapes (and if so, please include the Marvelettes! 
Sirius Puppy training shows the first-time and experienced puppy owner how to teach their puppy the sit, down, stand, off, come, and stay commands as well as bite inhibition, greeting people, etc. all through rewarding lavishly with praise and food treats. Parts of actual training classes with Dr. Ian Dunbar are included in this 90 minute VHS tape as well as helpful suggestions on puppy potty training and general handling tips. It is both humorous and entertaining while being informative. Segues well into a puppy training class in your area 
This is an excellent video for a new puppy owner! Even though I've had dogs all my life, it's been a long time since I had a puppy and wanted to make sure I did it right. The video is like taking a "puppy kindergarten" training course, but without the other puppies. You will learn a lot from watching, and re-watching, the positive training methods used. It is especially helpful to see how the owners each overcome unique difficulties with their dogs (a slow malamute, a shy Westie, a hyper Golden, etc.) The only downside to the video is that it is designed for puppies under the age of 18 weeks-- once they hit adolescence, while you can still use positive training methods, you will probably also need some corrections 
I found the information awesome. I found myself wanting to watch it over and over again. It is packed full of information, watching situations as they naturally present themselves and ideas. I hope Ian Dunbar does many more of these classroom environment tapes in DVD too ... I love watching trainers dogs in action 
Ground breaking training developed by the vet who started it all. I knew the cameraman and producer of this video in the 80's, Marty Blueford. His father raised Golden 's in Carmel where he met Dr.Dunbar.He told us all about this wonderful Dr. who loved dogs and promoted training puppies and using positive reinforcement.We bought a new Great Dane puppy and knew we had to watch this video and so ordered it from Amazon. I re-watched the video and found it still terrifi 
This would have to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen and I have sat through a lot of turkeys in my lifetime. It concerns an advertisng executive played by Kirk Douglas. Eddie is having a very bad Nervous Breakdown following an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Then he procedes to harrangue EVERYBODY he meets about his messed up life as if anybody could care less. Eddie is also carrying on an illicit affair with Gwen , played by Faye Dunaway. When Eddie is making love to his wife played by Deborah Kerr he is thinking about Gwen!!! I realize that millions of married guys all over the world do this but that don't make it right as the man once said.After about half an hour of watching this movie you get very tired of Eddie's whining and Ms. Dunaway makes the very intelligent observation that "the screwing I'm getting is not worth the screwing I'm getting". Gee. I felt pretty screwed after hiring this piece of junk from the Video Store for $3.50!!! I give this movie 5 stars because I kind of like Faye Dunaway although she has appeared in better films than this one 
In short, this movie shows how a man who's succesful and rich but lives in a permanent lie suddenly cracks up -in a very healthy way- and starts from scratch to re-evaluate his life: his job, his feelings toward his wife, his father, his lover. The confrontation between the establishment and someone who just wants to "live" -as he puts it- is brilliantly depicted. Elia Kazan's genius is very clear here. Very good acting from Kirk Douglas, Faye Dunaway and Deborah Kerr. I found interesting similarities between this movie and Peter Weir's Fearless 
This film is really only good for two things. 1. Chris O'Donnell appears without his shirt on for one scene 2. Faye Dunaway plays a crazy drunk (ultimate camp! 
Gene Hackman's electrifying performance dominates this adaptation of John Grisham's best selling novel. Hackman portrays Sam Cayhall, a man who's been on death row for sixteen years for the bombing of a lawyer's office that resulted in the death of the lawyer's two children. Cayhall is a vile man, who has lived a life of hatred and prejudice, the result of generations of such bigoted ancestors. Enter Chris O'Donnell as his young grandson, who is a lawyer and wants to reopen the case and spare his grandfather the gas chamber. What ensues is a painful exploration of hatred, prejudice and a dysfunctional family. I liked the movie, in spite of its several flaws. Hackman is phenomenal, and Chris O'Donnell does a good job as the naively innocent, but determined, young barrister. Faye Dunaway offers wonderful support as Hackman's estranged daughter who has lived a life of secrecy and guilt. Lela Rochon, Raymond Barry, David Marshall Grant and Robert Prosky offer fine support too. I found myself involved in the movie, and feel it didn't offer any easy answers. Hackman is a guilty man, but his performance is so well doone that one can't help but feel sorry for the life he has chosen, and the life he has sacrificed. I think it's well worth viewing 
Hilarious from beginning to end! Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me???? 
Yes, it is that funny. The humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP, in which Christopher Guest costarred, and predecessor to Guest's later masterpieces BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND. Reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre, in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary. Guest has in three films now masterfully emulated Reiner's style, assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again. Almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three. Unless one prefers dumbed-down slapstick, this is comedy just about as funny as it comes. The first time I saw it I don't think I really caught on until the scene where Blaine, Missouri's (the film was actually filmed in Texas) town historian recounted how Blaine was founded after wagon train leader Blaine Fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in California near the Pacific when in fact they were in Missouri. The plot is rather simple. In honor of the 150th anniversary of Blaine's inadvertent founding, a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue. Corky St. Clair, an obviously gay theater person who has fled New York for the small town, takes on the challenge of directing. The bulk of the movie consists of auditions, rehearsals, and the final performance of the musical. The title stems from the hope that a Mr. Guffman of a New York theatrical company will be in attendance. This film was literally made up as they went along. My understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which Guest had to craft a final film. While move films are refined in the editing phase, this one is unique for being created at that stage. Because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll, a film like this takes a special cast of actors. Veterans of improv like Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy and stand ups such as Fred Willard are to be expected, but what is so great is how people you wouldn't automatically think would excel in the form, such as the always delightful Parker Posey, do so. By way of trivia, the part of the play's narrator is played by Lewis Arquette, son of Cliff Arquette and father of all those other Arquettes, including Rosanna, Patricia, and David. And I'm sure all ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fans will love the UFO expert, played by none other than Tobias himself, David Cross (famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show). One of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a "Three Months Later" coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up. Corky is back in New York, hoping for tryouts (perhaps as Henry Higgins in a revival of MY FAIR LADY). The joke comes when we find out he is running a Hollywood memorabilia store, where one of the hottest items is a MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action figure set. For those who haven't seen the film, the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is Wallace and Andre talk while seated in a restaurant. I've learned the hard way that this and Guest's other films aren't for everybody. Not everyone seems to "get" them. This astonishes me since I find these films funnier than anything else coming out of Hollywood these days. But for whatever reason, so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them. But for those who are, these films are priceless gems 
Apparently this is one of those "cult" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits. "Waiting for Guffman" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the "funniest movie ever" or "hilarious" is definitely out of the mainstream. I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS. OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of "not helpful" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find "Waiting for Guffman" very amusing 
This is a really great and hilarious movie. If you're a Christopher Guest fan, and you like "Spinal Tap" and "A Mighty Wind", you'll love this one as well. It's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies, like Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, and they're all always great together. Also, David Cross is hilarious as the UFO nut. Definitely buy this movie. And don't forget to pick up a "Remains of the Day" lunchbox while you're at it 
If you have ever been involved in any sort of community or college theater, you have GOT to see this film. There is great truth in this fiction 
Waiting for Guffman is an awesomely funny movie! It's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot - awkward transitions, bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action. The characters are wonderful. Guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the over-exuberant Blaine Community Players. The movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty, thoughtful humor as well. What's great about this movie as well is that you're not just laughing at the characters, you're getting excited about the Blaine Sesquecentennial right along with them! The songs are catchy (in a frighteningly annoying kind of way), and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review. If you have seen other Guest movies, I would say this one ranks in the middle for me (Best in Show is my favorite, Waiting for Guffman, then A Mighty Wind). I think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of small-town pride and revelry. Loved it! Favorite line: "I hate you, you... bastard people... You're all bastard people! 
This movie is just plain hilarious. If you have ever known people who fancy themselves members of the creative elite BUY THIS DVD. The endless laughs will make up for all the suffering pretentious types have ever put you through. That's a bargain at any price 
Having known a few people who fancy themselves as creative types , it was a fun experience to watch this . One could argue that this misguided feeling that people have is one of the main concerns of Christopher Guest - it may be a limited view of people , but it is also a predominant problem for most of us . I would feel confident in saying that many of us have had to deal with a colleague who thinks they are wonderful . I don't mind that so much . For me , the problem comes when those types are put in charge of a group of people . This film can be seen as a comedy or as a good example of putting together a group of people who are more than a little self-centred . You will see the psychological game playing going on . It is a film for anyone who has ever been involved with amateur dramatics , or amateur anything . You will notice that Mr Guest has made a number of other films like this and they are all entertaining . I encourage you to see them all for the characters - the rich tapestry of humanity we all deal with every day 
As a child development teacher, I am constantly looking to better the children under my tutelage (socially, physically, emotionally, and cognitively). This video encourages all aspects of a child's growth and I would recommend it to any parent. It can be made practical enough for everyday use and comfy enough for a child's formal use. The instructions are paced well with clear visual aids for the children to comprehend. WISH MARJABELLE YOUNG STEWART WOULD MAKE MORE MANNERS VIDEOS(ex: Introductions, Proper sitting and standing postures, Phone manners, Conversational Manners etc. 
I thought my 2 and 4 year old sons could learn a few things about table manners by watching this video. It turns out that this video is only about eating in extremely formal situations. It tells which of your 5 forks to use first and how sorbet is used to cleanse your pallet between courses. Good if you are eating with the president, not good for the average family who would like to improve kids' manners 
Okay besides the clichï¿½ premise, this is a pretty good movie for anyone with young children in the house. The effects are good and it will make you laugh. Some people might call this a "girl's" movie, but I freely admit that I enjoyed it too. The story is somewhat of a modernized Cinderella story, complete with an evil stepmother, a charming prince, and a mistreated heroine. The fairy godmother in the classic original is replaced with Leonardo da Vinci--and it works. While there are no magic pumpkins turning into horses and carriages, there is magic and romance. Ever After also has an all-star cast from Anjelica Huston as the evil stepmother to Drew Barrymore as well, who else but the heroine. Drew Barrymore helps to make this movie what it is. Even down to the most unimportant nuances of the performance, she comes off as brilliant. You can believe she is a peasant in the field as much she is a royal courtier among the nobility of France. The emotion she is able to express is amazingly real. If you haven't seen it yet, and you have girls in the house under the age of 15 or so, you will want to experience this movie with them 
I really love this movie and especially love the relationships and realistic depth to all the characters. Danielle's relationship with her family is not unexpected because of the circumstances. Her Stepmother Romila could not deal with being left a widow, and the rivalry between her and her stepsisters was inevitable. Her relationship with the Prince is both comical and romantic and I absolutely love that Danielle's fairygodmother is the Great Da Vinci himself. That was infinitely most unexpected and wonderful. This will remain as my all time favorite movie and is definitely a CLASSIC 
A memborable, witty, more realistic twist on the Cinderlla Fable. A MUST for everyone's DVD library! Even my husband STILL loves to watch this.... and he's not much into these types of movies!! Drew does an outstanding job portraying Danielle with spirit,wit,kindness and vulnerability. Anjelica Huston is perfectly wicked. Both daughters steal their share of scenes and so does the likable friend-who's-a-boy, of Danielle. EVERYONE plays their parts will skill and are all memorable. LOVE the addition of Da-Vinci and his charm. This DVD will be replaced, when I wear out my current one... 
There are no words to describe this movie. It is 1 of my all time favorites! It is full of interesting story lines, beautiful people and of course your classic romantic fairytale only told in a real life way. I love this movie! I've watched it hundreds of times and I never get sick of it! 
This is one of those modernly done Cinderella stories that mixes comedy and romance so well. Drew Barrymore is perfect as the adorable, funny, smart, witty and tortured Cinderella character and Dougray Scott couldn't be better as the fresh faced, unconventional prince charming -- (just what a prince should be in my opinion!). The dialog is solid, acting is great and the music/soundtrack fits perfectly. Definitely a cinderalla story that you should add to your collection -- good for adults and children. I cried at the end! ; 
This is a truly romantic movie. I laughed, cried, cheered, and sighed along with Danielle's ups and downs. I would say that this movie is even better than the Cinderella fairytale since it realistically portrays the class differences that would have been evident between a poor servant girl and a royal prince. Love truly does conquer all. I especially loved that the evil step mother and step sister got what was coming to them at the end! Ms. Barrymore outdid herself 
Cinderella is the most popular fairy tale of all time. There are several versions of the story that we might have all read at different points as children. This had "chick flick" written all over it, but I was pleased with the results as they fleshed out this tale as best as they could. Drew Barrymore, the world's most successful comeback child star, plays Danielle, a young peasant girl in France. Like the fairy tale, her father remarries, gains a family of a step mother and two step sisters, then suddenly dies. Danielle is left with her new family but finds the true nature of her step mother to be cold and cruel (played wonderfully by Angelica Houston). Her bitter jealousy of Danielle's good qualities and contempt is obvious. What the fairy tale versions did not always hint at (with the possible exception of the Disney animated movie) was that the step mother is plotting for her own daughter to be in favor with the royal court and marry the prince. It makes for many hilarious situations with Danielle and her step mother and sister (see that scene when she knocks her over and her feet go flying over her head). Her younger step sister, while the weaker and clearly not the favorite of the two, makes for Danielle's unlikely ally. While Danielle tries to keep the peace and home and make the best of her situation, the prince of France one day comes right to her door. Prince Henry is suffering from a combination of cold feet and growing pains, and when a willful Danielle comes into the picture he is taken aback. While at first there is animosity between them, but the love will naturally grow. They incorporate some more modern themes in this story that your average so-and-so in those times might not have been thinking of (education, free thinking, justice system, etc.) because a vast majority were illiterate. Plus, Danielle is strong enough that she doesn't need the prince to come rescue her from the evil neighbor who bought her. She slays the dragon herself and has a humbled prince come before her asking her to take him back. And her fairy godmother is none other than Leonardo DiVinci himself. This is a wonderful take on the most beloved of all fairy tales and leaves wonders to the imagination 
I just had to right a review about my favorite movie. When people want to see a Cinderella movie they should watch this one and not the cheap imitations that get released every year. I have watched this movie over 50 times and am not ashamed to say that I have memorized the script. Every time I see it I can't help but shed a tear or more. I know this sounds extreme, but the screen play and actors are marvelous. You understand why the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston) hates Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore), and any woman can't help but fall in love with Prince Henry (Dougray Scott). I won't say more you have to see it to believe how wonderful it is. 
I remember when I was little when saw The lion king in theatres and was amazed at watching the animals and the Disney part of it. Now that I'm 18 however It is now an even greater film to me because of what's contained in this story of father and son love, revenge, tyranny, friendship, childhood romance, and ultimately all out war. Lately I was able to get my hands on the new platinum edition that was put back in the Disney vault some time ago and it is just beautiful. This movie I've always thought was awesome as a kid, but now that I'm older I feel it is a work of art and genius from the makers of Disney of how they were able to make the main character Simba into a type of Hamlet figure and chief villian Scar into a lion version of Adolf Hitler. I have word to the parents and thats to let your kids watch this film. They will forever remember the awesome and entertaining chracters such as: Simba, Mufasa, Timon, Pumba, rafiki, and above remember the deceivingly evil Scar and his army of hyenas. This is simply put my favorite Disney movie. 
I was a rather big fan of "The Lion King" when I was a kid. I saw the movie a couple of times in the cinema, I'm pretty sure, I had the comic, and I used to draw the characters in a notebook or two. I saw it on DVD just now, for the first time in quite a while, and its still as good, I think. The story is set on the African plains, where Mufasa the Lion King rules over the beasts. He has just had a son, an heir to this throne, Simba. He is an energetic and curious one, this cub, and his uncle Scar intends to take advantage of this. He wants to be the King of the beasts, and to do so he'll need both Mufasa and his son killed. He has a plan, and forging an unnatural alliance with the hyenas of the neighbouring territory, kills Mufasa and drives Simba out into strange and distant country, where he is rescued by Timon the Meerkat and Pumbaa the Warthog. As he grows older, Simba learns a lot of things, unlearns a lot of it, and eventually faces his destiny, that he is King of the beasts and that order and balance must be restored to the savannah. Will he be able to confront his uncle Scar and take back his Kingdom? I quite like the look of this film. It's traditional animation for the most part, with a hint of computer effects in some scenes (the wilderbeest stampede, for instance). It's colourful, it's details, and the bad guys are curiously angular looking. As for the plot, it holds together nicely too. There is a tiny hint of pop culture-isms, (Timon and Pumbaa dressing up in Hawaiian gear as a diversion, a few of the hyenas jokes, etc) and it's all right in small doses. It's handled better than a lot of kids features these days, which are often just wall-to-wall impersonations of suburbia and media. There are a few songs in the film too, penned by Tim Rice and Elton John, including the hit "Can You Feel the Love Tonight". I'm not the biggest fan of song and dance numbers in animated features, but they're done in such a way that it never gets too sickly. I don't think so, anyway. Worth a look for kids and fans of Disney 
Disney's "The Lion King" is a pretty good movie about a young lion cub, named Simba, who is to become king of a place called Pride Rock located in the appropriately named Pride Lands. I always thought that the part where Simba's father, Mufasa, is killed by his brother, Scar, was kind of tough to watch. On the other hand, from a historical standpoint, scenarios like these were at some point a commoplace reality, all because of an intense desire for power. The most memorable part of the film is the scene where Scar turns on the hyenas, to whom he'd referred as the "real enemy," then tries to make up with them right afterwards by calling them his "friends." The best part was the subsequent reaction by the hyenas to his double crossing. The KAB score: 8.3 super 
this movie was incredable. i don't understand how people can dislike this film. this movie's deep and intense story made it great for children AND their parents, a feat rarely accomplished. but rather than stay depressing and traumatizing, this film goes from drama to side-splitting humor within 13 seconds. the best part is that this is all done with seemless perfection. the music, which is a key element in any disney film, is great here. although it doesnt' have that distinct broadway feel to it, it is still very strong. it's power and brilliance comes from something eles entirely, and i'm not even sure what. in the end though, this is one of disney's greatest efforts. the clean, brilliant animation, the flawless story, adn the increadable music all come together for something truely spectacular. the only sad thing is that this became the begining of the end for disney animation. so treasure this gem, because from here on out, it's all downhill. : 
I give the original 5 stars, but why is disney taking all its classics and adding new songs to it? i was so dissapointed when i rented this and there were new scenes in it. i dont want "new and improved" i want the original, the one i watched when i was younger 
Shameless rip-off of "Jungle Taitei" ("Kimba the White Lion") by Tezuka. Any anime lover can tell. (Similarities in characters, scenes, and story lines are unbelievable.) Disney's response? "Never heard of Kimba." Oh, purleese. I'm kicking myself for paying Disney for this piece of swindle 
The greatest disney movie ever! (from most guys point of view 
who didnt like "The Lion King"?? let me tell you, that im 19 yers old, and i just bought that dvd for my collection!!!! i love movies, and i love dvds... and this movie is one of my favorites!!! P.S. all the ones that i rated with 5 stars are my favorites so far!! 
When you see the Lion King unavoidably for the 70th time like I have, you grow really sick of it. From the music to the storyline, it all breeds contempt. But the movie itself shouldn't be punished for its overexposure. It's a good story, even though it is similar to Hamlet. And it's a good movie. I won't venture to say it's the best cartoon ever because there are still other movies like Cinderellla and Snow White in existence; but it is definitely ONE of the best. The only picky issue I have is with the voices. They have the strong commanding voice of James Earl Jones as the father, which is right on point; yet they have Matthew Broderick as the voice of the son. He sounds like he hasn't yet reached puberty even though he's grown. Other than this, the film is excellent 
This is by far one of the best movies of all time! Disney produced a really funny and heartfelt movie. The movie is about a young lion prince who grows up to be the king. But it isn't that easy, he must go through many obstacles on his way there including his awful uncle Scar(Jeremy Irons) Nathan Lane throws in some laughs as well as Ernie Sabella. This is an impressive cast, and the movie is directed to perfection. Lion King can be watched and enjoyed in any age group. I highly recommend this wonderful movie 
They just released the Robert Altman Collection, so finally this forgotten classic must be on Dvd. No such luck. This is one of those black comedies that is a cross between the Keystone Cops and Greek Tragedy on acid. Escapism at its best 
Robert Altman made Brewster McCloud around the same time as his acclaimed MASH was released, but for some reason this has been forgotten over time. Revealing any of the story would be useless because the film is so utterly absurd it wouldn't make sense. The comedy ranges from bird poop on dead bodies to a supporting character who's a direct spoof of Steve McQueen's 'Bullitt.' Weird, silly, oddly sexual, and hilarious. Not for all tastes, but worth a look if you're up for something very, very different. A DVD release would be terrific, especially if Altman gave a commentary. *** out of *** 
If you like to think and be entertained, have a taste for black comedy and the bizare, this movie is for you. If you like Rambo, and Princess Diaries only, forget it 
God, what a weird movie. Very funny though. I was laughing the whole time. This movie is not for everyone however, but for those who like the offbeat, strange, funny ones, this one is for you. It's a little hard to follow, but it does have a cute story to it. It is put together well and has a great cast. I loved the ending!! 
The insatiable Bud Cort steals the show, but is only rivaled by the complex and theoretical plot. One can spend a few hours contemplating the exact allegorical comparisons between birds and humans, and still feel perplexed, yet satisfied. Do watch the film, which forces the audience to "...think outside the box 
This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst. We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it. But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying. If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it. Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN! (I had it confused with John Wayne's "Rooster Cogburn" and the Dennis Weaver's "McCloud" and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.) The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story. This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes 
when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media...... 
I was really expecting this to be more of a "scandal" documentary showing the missteps and lies of the current U.S. administration in regards to the Iraq war. It turned out to be a documentary showing the war from the Arab perspective (mostly through Al-Jazeera) and the perspective of a Marine public affairs officer who seems to support the current actions of the U.S. There really wasn't much animosity from either side of the spectrum, rather there was a lot of well-intentioned dialogue from both sides that would give anybody, regardless of political persuasion, better insight into the issues in Iraq and the Middle East 
What an absolutely brilliant documentary about the war in Iraq. I never realized how skewed and one sided journalism can be. I have much respect for Al-Jazeera and was excited to know that a documentary was being made about them and their take on the War with Iraq. The film travels back and forth between the stations headquarters in Qatar and CentCom which is the main press briefing room set up by the US military in Iraq. It's a breath of fresh air to see an entire network of people who are smart and committed to the idea of debate and communication. I don't think you could find that at any of the major news networks in the States. Their operations, anecdotes and analysis are worthy of a documentary alone. But there are specific moments in the film that are especially profound and upsetting. First and foremost, there is the death of an Al-Jazeera journalist. Before the troops entered Baghdad, the US committed air strikes on civilian targets including the building housing Al-Jazeera. In the attack, one of their correspondents is killed along with three other journalists. There is footage of the journalist facing him head-on right up until seconds before the attack. That along with a plea for justice from the journalist's wife and a completely absurd justification for the attack from the US is both infuriating and literally sickening. Finally there is the case of Lt. Josh Rushing. Throughout the film, he is the American representative that has debates and discussions with the many Arab journalists. Despite having to take the absurd position of defending US aggression, he is intelligent and empathetic. At one point he becomes self-analytical and candid talking about how he had seen images of dead Iraqi casualties one day and it didn't affect him. The next day, he was footage of American casualties and it made him sick. At that point he really had to face himself and while still in the process at least recognize how much he hates war. That story doesn't end there. With the release of the film, the Pentagon ordered Rushing not to comment on the film. Offended by this gesture, he is now seeking to leave the Marines. "Control Room" is a movie about the War with Iraq. But that's not the half of it. It's a movie that will hopefully widen the debate about television and what is objective journalism in this country. It's also another stone catapulted through the wall of Arab stereotypes. It's also an intelligent and engaging film that is as challenging as it is satisfying. 
This documentary gives a brief introduction to Al-Jazeera, which, if you didn't know already, is the main arab language newschannel. It is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it's willingness to go where other, stated-owned and controlled arab networks won't tread. In this sense it is more than a mere arab CNN in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media. The filmmakers here interview Al-Jazeera personel, as well as some american journalists, and the american official which liases with Al-Jazeera for Centcom, the american Central Command in the present Irak war (which happens to be 30 miles from Al Jazeera headquarters). It covers the timeline from just before the war, to just after Bush anounced main millitary operations to be over. By striving to be neutral, the documentary allows you to see how Al-Jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world. They are very disappointed in the United States, but adhere strongly to its values. Also interesting is how being "on the arab side" gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values, like when they are angered by Pentagon protests at their having showed images of US prisoners, when western media routinely show Iraki POWs. An unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be. The american liaison doesn't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source, and as if that weren't enough, he is barely articulate in english and clearly doesn't know anything about the local context and history. Another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials, but doesn't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists, irritating the very people they are trying to win over. All in all it's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds. It gets four stars rather than five because of it's sometimes amateurish handling of flow, which makes it at times a bit unfocused 
I found this DVD to be well produced and engaging to go along with the POWERFUL content. Fantastic. Loads of deleted scenes that are very worth watching 
Banned from American and British broadcast, this documentary is an essential look at the "other side." Whether you support the US war in Iraq, the informed citizen would benefit from a look at the control room. 
if you are sick of the way American network news tells the tale of world-wide news 
This is a "must-see" documentary for those who prefer to use their own 'unwashed' brains and consider themselves free thinkers and truth seekers. There is so much life and so many good values in the world, which are just as good and humane as those prevalent in the West. 
Excellent glimpse into one of the most important and integral news agencies of the decade. IF you can watch it with the "walk a mile in my moccasins" attitude, it is a fascinating and disturbing look at how the "2/3 world" sees the United States of America 
It's been ages since I used this tape. So I forgot how good the warm-up excercises made me feel. But this morning I pulled it from the shelf and gave it another try. To be honest, I haven't even come close to mastering all the instructions on this video. But the warm-up alone will make you feel great. And I hope to use this tape more often. Why and how does it work? Who can say? I just know that I feel better and more relaxed. I sincerely hope it does the same for you 
This is one of the greatest musicals of all time. The songs all became well-loved hits, and are known to music lovers of all ages, even today. Frank Sinatra, Shirley Maclaine, Louis Jourdain Maurice Chevalier got together to create a magical light love story, with fabulous singing and some good dance. The "I Love Paris" ballet is one of the classic dances of the screen, surpassed in my opinion only by Astaire-Rogers in Top Hat, the final ballet in American in Paris, John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing. The story line does wear a bit thin, with a somewhat silly ending in the cafe (movies made at that time sometimes suffered from this failing), but overall, this is still a classic. Why, oh why, is it not on DVD???? 
Can Can was the film that launched to overseas stages to Shirley Mac Laine one of the ten American actresses ever born. Based in the famous musical of Cole Porter of 1890s , this lackluster version involves to Frank Sinatra as the lawyer who will defend the rights of Miss Mac Laine to perform the daring dance in her nightclub. But the presence of the giants of the French song - Maurice Chevalier - and Louis Jordan makes of this musical a stand out musical still reminded after all these years. 
I currently own this VHS version. But I would buy the DVD in a heartbeat if it were available. And of course wide screen please. With commentary if possible. This movie and Gigi are both among my favorites 
I have to say that I rmember seeing Can-Can in its origional roadshow presentation in Los Angeles in my younger days. It was a great time at the movies, and I remember the scope of the widescreen and all those Can-Can dancers. I hope that we will soon see a DVD with the fully restored format in Letterbox, With Ovature and Intermission etc. While not the best musical every filmed I remember it fondly and would like to see a DVD that presents this move as it should be seen. Widescreen format, stero sound et al 
I agree with the other reviewer who found this movie hilarious. It is. This is a very fun movie to watch. Frederick is a pleasure to watch in this flick; he holds this perpetual look of borderline surprise throughout the film, as if he can't believe he's actually in this movie. He seems to compensate by maintaining an attitude of muted sardonic humor, not only in his facial expressions but in his lines. The picture quality and sound quality are horrible but they add to the film's ultimate charm; in other words, this is a plus rather than a minus. It's a game to look for all the flubs. In one scene at the beginning one can clearly see the boom mike sticking up from under the coffee table, panning right and left as each character talks in turn. And the rubber babies? Can't beat it. Let's just say I highly recommend this to all lovers of B horror flicks 
When I saw the first "It's Alive" movie in the theatre when I was 17, it scared me so bad I couldn't sleep alone for 3 nights. Funny, when I saw it the other night, I could not figure out what scared me. It is such a funny movie. The cinematography is extremely bad, but I guess it was good for 1976 or whenever it first came out. This movie is not as good as the first and I'm going to watch the third tonight. I'm expecting it to be equally bad 
This film was so much more exciting to see. Larry Cohen is still the master of classic horror films. In this one, there are three more babies, and the sounds of their crying you just have to laugh about. Some of the scenes that are supposed to be scary are actually quite hilarious also, but it still holds you to your seat. Another thing that made the movie so good was that Larry had kept Bernard Herrmann's music, and had asked a friend of his called Laurie Johnson, a British composer well known for the tv shows The Avengers, to adapt Herrmann's music. I love to watch these Alive films all the time, but I haven't seen the third one yet, and I want to so badly. This film is a classic next to the first one, and I recommend it to anyone who love classic horror films 
This is an excellent video for collectors and enthusiasts. Those who plan to learn martial arts, should look elsewhere though. --- http://www.geocities.com/bjjamalta Official Web Site of the Bushido Ju-Jitsu Academy (Malta).

Narrated by John Saxon, who played a fellow martial artist in "Enter the Dragon" with Bruce Lee, Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan... Wait, they're all potrayed in this tape! Along with Jet Li and the others this documentary gives you insight on how it is to be a martial artist. Gives you good, clean information and very crisp fight scenes 
This is mostly a showcase of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan,Samo Hung and other greats.The fight are some the greatest ever made for the silver screen.If one movie could show in 90 minutes the real meaning of "Martial Arts",this movie is it 
I love this movie. It is not in English, but the story is easy to understand, and has an ending you will always remember. A great popcorn evening at home movie 
I enjoyed this movie so much 'cuz it help me thru my math skills and how I can use them to study and learn. This is the best school movie I ever enjoyed incl. the soundtrack. I was 5 or 6 when I grew up w/ this and I liked it a lot. I mean a WHOLE lot. It teaches you the basic on how you can multiply, add, subtract or divide whenever you feel like counting or you can get in your head. Sometimes it easily to try w/o giving up. My mom and dad teach me better to stay in school and learn a good education. Probably to me I'm a fast learner and I count money real well too. I recommend this along w/ Money Rock to go with it. This is a must-have to keep if u luv math or else it's not your favorite subject 
you tired of learning multipliplacation by talking and no videos?Well,those days are over because of Schoolhouse Rock!-Multiplication Rock (1973).This is more fun then just having to talk about multiplication and not understanding it.It has songs,too 
When I was in third grade I never could get my times tables down pat- the sevens and twelves proved especially tricky. So my mom checked out this video from the library, and that changed immediately. I could rattle off my multiplication tables as fast as everybody else after watching this only a few times. Amazing! That same year I got put in advanced math. Coincidence? I think not! All the songs were just so catchy. I loved it when I saw the NIKE commercial playing "Three is the Magic Number", that's one of my favorites. Anyways, parents, this is a great buy for your kids and I doubt that you'll get tired of the tunes 
EXCELLENT TAPE. REALLY HELPED MY NIECE WITH HER MULTIPLICATION. EXCELLENT TAPE 
I am a teacher of 13 years. Many people know that there are 5 specific learning styles and these tapes address many of these styles through innovation and repetition! Catchy songs have seen many of my classes singing to themselves and gaining confidence on tests and test scores! I cannot speak any higher of the series! GET IT!! 
Some of what's on television is harmful to kids (and possibly adults), much of what's on television is neutral, and some of it is quite good. "Schoolhouse Rock" falls into a fourth category: stroke of genius. Catchy tunes, pop-style lyrics, and repetitive lessons are blended into memorable little pieces of educational fun that should never have stopped. The multi-sensory presentation of material catches the attention of, and involves, both brain hemispheres for processing, making memory of the material much more likely. If you want something on TV while the kids are getting ready for school, or when they're having an after-school snack, this is it. If teachers want quick, fun ways to introduce concepts, this is it. Television doesn't get better than this for kids 
I was of the original generation of kids that this series taught how to multiply. It first came on in 1973 when I was in second grade-perfect timing! Fortunately, it wears well. My neices also learned multiplication and some American history from ths series, so like Sesame Street, it'll live on. Minor complaint-I miss the jingle with Bob Dorough singing, "Multiplication Rock was brought to you by-Your very favorite general-General Foods!" that graced these episodes on their original airings. Mabye some lawyers could work something out in the future packagings 
This tape is great. Helped my younger sister with her multipication tables. Would recommend to anyone who is struggling with math is school. Songs surprisingly good for a children's tape 
I was expecting much more from this video. It did have kids doing poses, but it was hard to find the 13 year-old. Some of the circle games looked like they might be fun. I wanted to show it to my third grade class, but I don't think it would hold their interest. All in all I felt I was watching someone's home video of their family doing yoga 
I was disappointed in this video. I was looking forward to doing a routine with my 5+ year old and trying to start her on self-regulatory techniques. The video merely did a well-paced run through of various poses, but gave no structure or routine to follow. Most disappointing 
Its very rare when a sequel holds the same magical charm as its first but this sequel has done just that. If you loved the first movie, you'll be equally pleased with this one. The original cast along with holding true to the book series makes this a must see 
"Anne of Green Gables--the Sequel" Is a well done, beautifully photographed and scripted portrayal of the wonderful novel by Lucy Maud Montgomery. This movie continues the story of the older Anne Shirley as she faces the challenges of separating from the home she loves and staying true to her strong sense of self as she finds her place in her adult world. The interplay of familiar and newly introduced characters is compelling. This movie is well worth your time and money and a great conversation starter for family time together. Get the movie "Anne of Green Gables" also and watch it first for the most enjoyment. 
This movie is a wonderful follow up to the first...Anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone 
I love this movie almost as much as I love the first one! While not entirely true to the books, it does at least pull most of it stories from the books in one form or another. Whether or not the stories are pure L.M. Montgomery, this movie is true Anne. It's worth all five hours to get to the ending 
This is an impressive sequel and a very good looking follow-up to ANNE OF THE GREEN GABLES. It is great to see Megan Follows as Anne Shirley once again. Megan Follows is just perfect in this role. Anne Shirley is now a bit older, has become a teacher and is quite involved in a society away from her rural settings. This gradual progression of characters and story from this original is very welcome and enjoyable. It is very endearing in many ways as was the original 
This is a well-produced and written sequel. It is faithful to the original production and to its literary roots in a concise form. I extremely enjoyed it and found it to be a good follow-up to the lives of the central characters from the original ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. The cast was very good and gave very credible and memorable performances. I was very impressed with Frank Converse, an actor I always liked and it was good to see him in a substantial role once again. Megan Follows is once again brilliant and very charismatic as Anne Shirley. The print is very good making the details of the sets and beautiful outdoor photography emerge quite stunning. I highly recommend this one. 
Collected my items from the hotel a day before schedule! Good job! 
It's two years later and Anne leaves Green Gables to attend Queen's University but goes different route in getting teaching job and the adventures and misadventures continue. Superb, though a bit condensed; it asumes everybody has seen the first of series a bit much. But bouyed with superb ending and sets up the third well enough... but like Crocodile Dundee III (er, ah, in L.A.), why does it take 13 years to come out between the second and third in these Series?! Those Canadians and Aussies like to make you wait, eh? Rating all three on normal 1-4 star rating scale: Anne of Green Gables **** Anee of Avonlea ***.5 Anne of Green Gables Contining Story ** 
This continuation of the Anne series on screen is very well done, and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did. The only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers. What it really does is just focus on a few key incidents, and drastically truncates Anne's college and teaching experiences. Morgan Harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of Roy Gardner, Sophy Sinclair, Old Mrs. Gibson and Pauline, and Elizabeth. This installment ends with Anne and Gilbert becoming engaged. I highly recommend it - just don't expect the same level of detail as "Anne of Green Gables" provided 
At first, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the video. It did seem to be a home video, but I think that added to it's charm. Rich Grogan seems to be just like some of the father's I know around town, making silly mistakes in his routine. He's real. I found the workout to be easy enough for my 5 year old daughter to follow and challenging enough for me to get a good workout. I have never been able to follow a video workout before. This was great and enjoyable. Both my daughters and I enjoy the workout and get more out of it each time we do it AND it doesn't require a lot of space. I like it's simplicity. 
This video is "A" #1 for gradeschool kids - PERIOD!!!! My school district is made up of 10 gradeschools, so needless to say, there is a large number of teachers, parents students involved within this district. I reviewed this video at a physical education conference, and was 100% sold on the ideas concepts. I was in one of Mr. Grogan's demonstrations, which had about 200 P.E. teachers in the crowd. Let me tell you, I've been involved with physical education, school systems, and children for the past 25 years, and I don't think I've EVER seen the response given to a program the way people responded to this one. The word AWESOME doesn't even come close to describing the amount of fun we had with this program. So of course I bought a DVD for each one of the gradeschools in the district. And, without any surprise to me, I've received numerous phones calls from the teachers parents as to how much they LOVE this program. The way Mr. Grogan interacts with the kids in the video, and the way he makes the viewers feel like they are part of the class is amazing. He is truly a professional in the art of teaching interacting with children, and believe me, I've seen my share of poor teachers, especially poor P.E. teachers, who simply took the job as a P.E. teacher because they couldn't do anything else. Anybody who is serious about being a good teacher, especially with children, will quickly see how amazing Mr. Grogan's positive interaction is with the children in the video. Mr. Grogan also explains in the video why he has changed some of the movements to eliminate the violent characteristics of punching kicking. Mr. Grogan explains, instead of doing a cross punch, have the children pretend to grab apples, this will take the focus off of punching another student on the playground. But, by keeping the muscle mechanics the same as a punch, but simply changing the intent meaning of the punch, the kids can still gain the positive benefits involved in throwing a punching technique. To actually see the kids on the playground saying playing grab the apples oranges, making apple pie orange juice is pretty amazing to see. To fully understand this you'll have to see the video for yourself. And believe me, not only will you be impressed, but your kids will absolutely love the program and they will also impress you with the way they remember the movements, and how they often ask to do this program. Without a doubt this is the best kids fitness program I've ever seen, and Mr. Grogan is one of the best at interacting with kids. 
My kids I absolutely LOVE this program. The kids on this program are having fun, because it is a fun workout, and my kids I enjoy watching these happy little faces exercise. Kids are motivated by other kids having fun, and the joyful atmosphere that Rich Grogan instills helps make this video my families personal favorite 
Now kids wont ever have to leave the house. They can suck down their McDonalds and then mommy wont have to feel guilty about not taking the 30mins to cook. I'm glad this stresses non-violence because no child would ever make the correlation between kicking and martial arts on TV. Now nobody will have to get the discipline benefits of martial arts programs along with the excersize they provide. Sweet 
I agree 100% with the other reviews. This video is pretty amazing, and just like the other reviews had stated, the kid's involvement is even more amazing. I popped this video in and the kids didn't move from the T.V. Now, I can't tell you that they did the entire program the first couple of times, but they still watched it. And, after about 3 times watching it they got through the entire program with only a few breaks. This is another awesome feature, because a lot of exercise videos, especially childrens leave no room for growth. Meaning, you have mastered the video the first time through, and after watching it a second or third time you are bored with it. This is especially true for children, who get bored of just about anything after a few times. But, like I mentioned this program is different, it is challenging enough to keep the kids trying, but not to tough where they lose interest. In my opinion it is a perfect balance, which in itself is pretty amazing 
Boy am I glad this video is now available on DVD. I have almost wore out the VHS copy. Or should I say my 4 kids have. They love this video, I've never seen anything like it. Who would think that kids would actually enjoy exercising? I sure wouldn't have. I bought the VHS about six months ago, because my kids liked the cover and I told them they needed to start exercising instead of playing video games all the time. Well, I figured this video would get played once and then get lost in the huge stack of videos we already have. Well here it is six months later and it is still sitting out by the TV. That just blows my mind. Don't get me wrong, this video is really awesome, I just can't believe how hooked my kids are to it, it's amazing. Anyway, one of my kids saw that this video was now on DVD, so we had to buy the DVD. Lord knows how many times the DVD will get played. But, I got what I wanted out of the deal, the kids are exercising more, and playing video games less. I even think they are seriously getting in better shape. Simply amazing 
Terriffic Movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt 
This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that. I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry. My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other. This scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film. Although it's the last time that Mitch ever sees Morrie alive, it's still very sweet and poignant. The ending is pretty sad, but it's also happy at the same time. Morrie is gone, yet his legacy lives on. I recommend this movie to anyone, of any gender, of any age. 
This movie was so very well done, and so very sad. It will reach-around from behind you and pleasure you in a way you didn't expect, but will leave you feeling very sad at the end. Sad, but inspired - and that is what this movie is about. Inspiration. Morrie was a great, stand-up character who was always "pitching a tent", so to speak. I highly recommend this movie 
This is an excellent story about what life is really all about. The book and DVD make excellent gifts too. I highly recommend both products! 
 The film exhibition as the act of dying can be lived with love and people that love each other enter, creating a protection atmosphere, of support, of peace. Morrie gives us a life lesson in the death 
I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen 
This movie makes you think about things we don't think about everyday.... life, death, and what's important. Defintiely an eye-opener... deep and emotional at times. 
I had read the book first befoe viewing the TV movie and to tell you the truthe i couldn't tell which came first: the chicken (movie) or the egg (book) Jack Lemon and the rest of the cast were suberb 
It took me all of 4 hours to read this book. It was insightful and entertaining. It was also sad. I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours. I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever 
How about DOLLAR COST AVERAGING? Interest? The National Debt? You have to buy this. Economics courses in college were never this interesting 
I don't remember these from when I was a kid, but I'm sorry I missed them. From Tyrannasaurus Debt which talks about how how the national debt got started to pay for the Revolutionary War to how it grew to monsterous size, to how to manage your allowance, buy stocks, plan a budget, and mangage your checking account, this video chock full of advice and information that even helped this 28 year old 
Director Sam Raimi crafts this story from the best seller. Set in a cold, wintry rural landscape, Brothers Hank (smart accountant Bill Paxton) and Jacob (dim-witted Billy Bob Thornton), along with Jacob's equally dumb friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), find a downed plane full of four million dollars. The pilot is dead and no one else knows about it. Could it be drug money? Sounds simple. However, family, greed and common sense don't always mix and the story soon goes haywire. No need to give away anything else other than there is an unexpected body count and an ending that will shock. This is one of those sleeper hits that never fails to surprise and delight. Bridget Fonda costars as Paxton's wife who goes through her own metamorphosis. 
Director: Sam Raimi Cast: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe, Jack Walsh, Chelcie Ross, Becky Ann Baker, Gary Cole, Bob Davis. Running Time: 121 minutes Rated R for violence and language. This is a diabolical tale about the wages of greed. Although it is played straight without intentional humor, the irony is so delicious at times that you might find yourself laughing. Jacob Mitchell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the one who begins to feel evil, and rightly so as the bodies begin to pile up. His presumably smarter brother Hank (Bill Paxton) feels mostly fear as he struggles to cover up one mishap after another. Their problems begin when they and Jacob's buddy Lou Chambers (Brent Briscoe) stumble onto a downed airplane in the woods covered with snow in which they find one dead person being feasted on by crows and a duffle bag full of hundred dollar bills. Lou, who might represent the common man, says, let's keep it. Hank, who could be rational man, says, whoa, this money belongs to somebody and besides we could get into trouble. We better turn it in. And Jacob, who is the natural man, sides with his buddy Lou. After all they're country poor and this is probably drug money that nobody is going to miss. And anyway, what can go wrong? Well, as Ben Franklin observed a long time ago, `Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.' As they wait for spring to come and the plane to be discovered before they risk spending the money, the `simple plan' begins to unravel with horrific consequences. Thornton and Briscoe play country boys to perfection, and Paxton does a great job as a small town golden boy seriously compromised. Bridget Fonda plays Hank's pregnant wife, who turns out to be the brains (as it were) of the group. There are some very nice plot twists as the all too human emotions of the characters begin to crash into one another. Inevitably we have a morality tale in which the wages of sin are fully realized. Sam Raimi's ("The Evil Dead", "Spiderman) direction captures well the atmosphere of North Country America without any obvious straining for effect. He gets great mileage out of a few crows (actually some of them are ravens, I think) and a whole lot of snow. Scott B. Smith's script (from his novel) is clever and morally astute. The characterizations are excellent and the story psychologically satisfying. Particularly agreeable was the very sad, ironic end for Hank and his wife, who find that all the self-created hell they went through led them back to where they began, but without their souls. A dark message about greed and honesty is a topsy-turvey roller-coaster ride with beautiful cinematography and slick direction from horror-master Raimi. Not one for those who need a cheering-up session. 
A friend of mine told me to watch this movie. We were talking about things that can get really bad, and just go out of control. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch. I prefer those girly movies. Oh mine! The movie was so good! I couldn't stop watching. It got so late and I had to come back the next day to finish watching, I was so eager to know the ending of the movie. Billy Bob represented his movie character so well. It is a dark, very interesting movie 
Contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has NO subtitles or closed captions or whatever. The R2 neither. So again, don't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff. Non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format, no subs, not available at all (yes I mean you, Disney)... In short, no quality or consistency. Go and take a hike. Stop lobbying for legislation and start making real DVD's 
this is the perfect shakespearean drama: in the middle of winter, when all color is reduced to black, grey and white, just like the tight plot reduced to the essentials: the ravens, gloom onlookers on every dramatic turn. bridget fonda the perfect lady macbeth, horrid yet utterly authentic with a baby in her arm while plotting each murder. bill paxton, your wished-for neighbor and pal, open-faced yet capable of cold-blooded murder; billy bob thornton as his retarded brother, retarded and yet the only one who truly understands the situation and its implications. the only one, too, who stays true to his beliefs. it is one of the very few movies out there where violence is not just exploited in order to glue viewers to the screen but is absolutely necessary to emphasize the course of events. a "simple" drama: a simple plan. 
Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese. This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert. I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction. Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly. When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point? The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory. And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense. One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch. 
Two brothers and a friend stumble across a crashed airplane full of cash (4.4 million dollars, to be precise) in the snowy woods. Our wise hero, played by Bill Paxton, devises a simple plan in which they can lay low with the cash to determine if anyone is looking for it, then move out of town and split the bounty. If only he could control everything... The bag o' cash is just a starting point for this riveting morality tale. The bottom line is that one lie always leads to another, and our little trio, plus the wives, get in deeper and deeper. There are bound to be crossed loyalties in a group of three--the brothers have family ties, and the friend is loyal to only one of the brothers (the Billy Bob Thornton character). A push-and-pull over the loyalty of Thornton's character ensues. Each man has different family and work pressures, and not all are as patient as the one who devised the clear-headed simple plan. It's captivating to watch money change the motives and behaviors of these men. The real star is Billy Bob Thornton, playing the down-and-out loser Jacob. He's a nobody in town, a generally recognized screw-up, but he is truly the philosopher of the group. He has very simple desires of resurrecting his dead father's farm, and he can't imagine taking the cash and leaving the only town he's ever known. In the end, he plays the only man with a conscience. My chief complaint with both the movie and the novel of the same name is the way the Sarah character goes through a complete personality change. She's two completely different people at different points in the movie, and her change in behavior isn't well-explained. All other characters, however, are exceptionally well-developed. 
Good performance by Billy Bob Thornton. A lot of outside scenes shot on location in northern Minnesota in the dead of winter 
For a plot synopsis please read the Amazon review. I wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film. As a longtime fan of both Sam Raimi (of the Evil Dead series) and Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister), I went to see this on opening night. Not many people can claim this I'm sure because it was and is, such a small film that received next to no marketing. For shame. This film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, both made by the Cohen brothers. Film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers, so I won't bother to get into that. Should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them, I suggest you stop reading and immediately rent A SIMPLE PLAN. If not, keep reading and I will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant. And why I hope you will take a look at it. A SIMPLE PLAN is, at its core, about four people. And underneath all the plot devices and twists, it's about how they relate to one another. Notice I did't say characters, because this film doesn't have actors simply delivering dialogue. It's about people you get to know, understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas. Sure, finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device, but the heart of this film is much simpler than that. It's about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it. And being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process. That's what gives this film such depth. You watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash. And in the end it falls apart for two reasons: the details and the human factor. They say the Devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime. As for the human factor, where greed is concerned, people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person's greed while are unable satisfy their own. In many respects this film is almost an homage to BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, but in many ways I think it is superior. I often draw the comparison by a scene which is both A SIMPLE PLAN and BLOOD SIMPLE where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of. And even afterwards, after the emotional toll the has been taken, once one evil act is committed, another is sure to follow. It's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera, frantically going over the details in their mind, all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute. Bill Paxton does this better than anyone. He is such a likable man (both in the film and in life) that you can't help but feel sorry for the mess he has created. His entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime, keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife. That may make them all sound malicious, but really the opposite is actually true. They're all normal folks, like we've all seen a hundred times. And in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in. After all, were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss, what would you do? But then again, nothing is ever that simple 
Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards. "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy). I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit, who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead. This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas ï¿½kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like. I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing. 
John Leguizamo is hilarious, and the movie has its very funny, quirky , unusual moments. Not a ground breaker but in your face / spoof of dirty white trash junkie movies. Lots of dirty jokes just plain nasty for those inquiring minds. The only reason I gave this movie Five Stars is because of a scene with John Leguizamo on the phone with a 1- 800 number girl naked with a tube sock, Mena Suvari on the toilet asking for toilet paper and the cops about to break in the crack house, if thats not funny then comedy is overrated 
Spun is an absolute pleasure to watch. It doesn't wait around to get noticed, instead it sets it's own pace, like for example - No credits roll in the beginning, no apologetic character introductions, there is no STOP sign in this film, everything is unhooked and raw,YET nothing seems to be out of place. The direction is bizzare, camerawork is staggering at places, the sets are like gutters, the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level. There are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too. The reason I compare Spun with Run Lola Run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the German wonderflick was. Spun is possibly one of a kind. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Trainspotting. Now, that is saying a lot. Unfortunately, I haven't seen many movies like Spun in Hollywood. So I have no recommendations. This is an absolute must watch, if there ever was one 
There are dozens of Don't Do Drugs flicks that feel like after-school specials, with their sluggish morals and predictable endings. Well, I can say that the ending of this movie was predictable, but the build-up to it, the acting and the finesse with which the special effects were implemented (voices going in and out of focus, characters in fast forward, teeth grinding) had me SPUN from beginning to end. Though Brittany Murphy gets most of the cover, the story is really about Ross (Jason Schwartzmann), a part of a screwed-up extended family that are all hooked on methamphetamines, including secondhand dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), spaced-out game geek Frisbee (Patrick Fugit), and others. When Ross meets Nikki (Murphy), he gets hooked up to the real deal: a man that calls himself the Cook, who wears boots with spurs and a cowboy hat and spits, fights, and tweaks like a man. The movie, for the most part, follows Ross's exploits as he becomes the Cook's errand boy, ferrying Nikki around in exploits like taking her dog to the vet (who has turned green from too much inhalation), and otherwise taking the Cook out to score, buy beer and porn, etc. The best part about this movie is the dead-on behavior of the junkies. They hug and kiss you, they reassure you with pretty lies, they make you feel right at home - but the second they're short on drugs, or you say the wrong thing to them, they scream and throw things around. The next day you're friends again until the next fight, which is never very far off. And though you are led to believe through the whole movie that the Cook is the head cheese, it is interesting (and accurate) to discover that he is reporting to someone even bigger. And yuck, is the personal hygiene right on the nose for these characters - their teeth are gritty, their clothes dirty and raggedy, and through the few days we follow them it doesn't appear that any one of them ever takes a shower. All they want - no, need - is their next fix. The part that sold me from the beginning was the words that came onscreen as the film started up: BASED ON TRUTH AND LIES 
The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR 
'Spun' follows the lives of several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted, roller coaster days, but this is not your ordinary 'drug' film. The ambience and atmosphere is so in-tuned with this degenerated culture that you can smell the illegal drugs cooking. Giving the plot away would be moot, since it is a portrayal of everyday life for people of this particular scene. So, what separates 'Spun' from the rest of the drug flicks? Gritty realism, hilariously bizarre scenes, atmosphere, some great acting, and a complete lack of fear on the part of the creator and the director to dive into the nastiest of behaviors and expose them as pathetic and comical. The sets are what you will see in real life meth houses. The dress and behavior of the characters is very realistic. My only real problem with the movie is that some of the jerk/flash camera work gets a little annoying, but still serves its purpose of bringing the "tweak" to the screen. Interspersed in the film are some ridiculous cartoon scenes that are a riot, and two cops that parody TV shows like "Cops" and "Bounty Hunters", along with flash stills and hilarious action music. I am going to be haunted forever by the Spider Mike (John Leguizamo) scene where he is jumping up and down on the bed with a sock on his unit while abusing himself. You'll see what I mean, Leguizamo is brilliant in his role. Mickey Rourke has proven himself to be quite an actor, a chameleon who can adapt to any role. In 'Spun', he plays The Cook, a nasty loosing white trash cowboy type who cooks the dope for the gang. Watch for Ross's (Jason Schwartzman) hallucination of The Cook's all-American speech in the video store. "Ask not what the kitty can do for you (substitute the 'P' word for kitty), but what you can do for the kitty." Look for a surprising performance from Brittany Murphy (Just Married, Sin City) as Nikki. The more I see of Brittany's work, the more I like her as an actress. Eric Roberts (playing The Man) may have had one bad role after another, but his part in 'Spun' is perfect for him and very well done. The Man, with his earring and his muscle boys and his overdone lisp was too funny to watch. Roberts worked with Rourke in 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' back in the early 80's, and its plain that they still mesh as actors. Watch for Debra Harry (80's group Blondie) as Ross's nosy neighbor, and Ron Jeremy, the king of p*rn, as the bartender in the strip club. All in all, 'Spun' is a movie with a serious twist that will leave you laughing in the wake of the character's bizarre activities. This is one of the best drug/bad behavior movies I have watched, right up there with 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'Kids'. Truly, a must-see movie. Enjoy! 
This movie takes you on a ride of a lifetime its pure entertainment as its cast of characters leave you shaking your head saying to yourself ill pass on the line of meth 
i love this movie. it's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment. WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE????? 
I have seen this movie at least 25 times and it never gets old. I saw it twice at the movie theatre and bought it on video as soon as it was released. I have since purchased it on DVD and enjoy the extras. It's great for all ages, plus the music is awesome. Funny fact: A soundtrack was never released until after it actually won an Academy Award for Best Original Score by Bill Conti. And even then, it was slapped together in a hurry, because people ran out to buy a soundtrack that didn't exist! It's a wonderful story about a facinating subject that everyone in the family can enjoy. It is longer than average movies, but that's okay. Well worth the time spent. If you have never seen it, treat yourself and your family to a movie night, with The Right Stuff, popcorn and goodies. You'll be so glad you did! 
Great movie. The photography, sound, story line and acting was outstanding 
As a fan of the space program and it's great history I really like this movie. This is an excellent dvd of the movie, and it contains much printed information on the movie, actors, etc,. but I was a bit disappointed that it didn't contain footage and interviews of the making of the film. I would still recommend it to Right Stuff fans however 
If you are fascinated about the space program... this is a must see DVD. Ed Harris makes a better John Glenn than the real John Glenn and he is a living American hero 
At a time when movies were swamped with special FX (is that time over yet?), this film was made, or rather crafted the old-fashioned way. Based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling book, the story of Gordo Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom and the other Mercury astronauts plays like sciece fiction. Evoking the 'fifties ouvre, this is a beautiful period piece but also a reflective work of filmmaking. Particularly riveting is playright Sam Sheppard's portrayl of test pilot Chuck Yeager, who ran the X-15 rocket plane, a precursor of the Challenger, through its paces. This is quite a long film; it took two cassettes on video. It's also one of the few films that warrants a double disc, since the history of the space program is both intriguing and little-known. All in all a great film, not to be missed. 
I sold my single disc version of this DVD for the special edition just for the additional material. A worthy investment for the serious collector. 
This movie has it all. It captures the independent spirit of Americans during the race to explore outerspace; the humor, the intelligence, the feistiness and pioneering spirit of the original seven astronauts; superb acting and well-written, well thought-out scenes. Though the movie is long, it seems like it's over in a blink of an eye. The additional information, such as the commentaries and behind-the-scenes footage, is also interesting. It should make all Americans proud of all that was accomplished in such a short period of time 
Lavishly praised by critics and nominated for several Oscars, THE RIGHT STUFF is the perfect movie for those gung ho, flag waving patriotic gents who beatified the US space program's birth and eventual domination of the skies. Writer/director Philip Kaufman, working from Tom Wolfe's novel, certainly had the right stuff in terms of casting, visuals, editing and the capturing of time periods from 1947-1963. The rigorous training of these seven astronauts is also expertly displayed, as is the quest of Chuck Yaeger to be the fastest man on earth. With the exception of Donald Moffat in a too cartoonish impersonation of Lyndon Johnson, the cast is exemplary with standout turns from Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Fred Ward, Pamela Reed and Annie Deschanel particularly. Sam Shepard and Barbara Hershey are also dynamite in their roles as Yeagar and his wife. The movie's length can be frustrating, as is the ending, which seems to come out of nowhere, but THE RIGHT STUFF is good moviemaking 
My 4-year old son loves watching this movie with his Dad. This movie is heaven for boys of all ages. Space ships and all-American heroes. What can be more fascinating? And the sound track is very upbeat and romantic at the same time. My "boys" keep humming the melody 
I think "Jabberwok"'s review (August 2005, see below) was pretty much right on the mark, noting the two main flaws with the film: It tried but failed to capture the excellence of Wolfe's written words, and it was too long. I would add that it goes a bit over the top in trying to be funny (the LBJ scenes come to mind). But it is entertaining and features some great performances, and very good special effects (a nice touch that can be missed if you're not paying attention is the views of clouds, the earth's surface as seen from space, and a capsule's opening parachute -- all appearing in mirrors on the chests of the astronauts. Really adds a brilliant illusion of reality, considering the actors are in a fake capsule on a movie set). One element that has taken on some irony over the years is the iconic image of John Glenn that is presented. It no longer rings true, since Glenn, several years later, acted unethically in supporting Bill Clinton in exchange for a ride on the space shuttle (yes, I know, this is just my opinion. But it happens to be the opinion of Chuck Yeager, too, and he stated as much for public consumption) 
I always find it irritating to read analyses of military movies by obvious civilians who know nothing about the military, combat and specifically about the Marine Corps. This is one of the best movies John Wayne made and was the one, at least, for which he should have won an Oscar. The Stryker character, played by Wayne, was not a "martinet". He plays a Marine sergeant, a combat veteran, the way a Marine sergeant is supposed to be. Tough, but fair. He pushes his people, boots (recruits), because he wants to help them survive when they hit the beach. If they don't survive they are no good to him and no good to the mission. Wayne does an excellent job of portraying that. The surviving flag raisers who were in the movie were Marines Gagnon and Hayes, and Navy Corpsman Bradley (whose son wrote Flags of Our Fathers), not, as one previewer noted, "three Marines". Navy Corpsmen are proud to be Navy Corpsmen and are respected as such by the Marines with whom they serve. Also, the characters were not "soldiers" and it is really irritating when that term is used to describe Marines. The men this story is about were Marines and the actors play Marines, a title that is EARNED. In short, even though actual combat footage is spliced into the movie's action, given the time it was made, it is well done. There are some romantic lulls, but given the period the movie was made, 40s and 50s, this was fairly typical. Overali, this is a great movie, even if you are a civilian. It will give fans of the Duke something memorable to watch. It may also give critics of John Wayne a new view of the man as a solid actor 
I feel that this is one of John Wayne's best! He plays a tough Commander with a soft spot for the mother and baby in the picture. This is a true classic! A must own for every Wayne fan! 
Great movie but don't EVER forget Ira Hayes. Listen to old Johnny Cash he's aweseome, but this movie is great. the movie and the song are incredible. even more amazing is the vet himself, Ira Hayes who was right there at Iwo Jimo holding up Old Glory herself. God Bless Ira, Johnny, and The Duke. great war film!!! god bless Ira!! 
John Wayne stars as Sgt. Striker. Striker is a marine who is given a group of misfits to turn into men. Striker is also dealing with problems at home. His wife hates the military and has left him taking their son away. Wayne is obviously concerned about what will happen to his son in the clutches of someone who may teach him none of the values of being an American. Making it worse, one of Wayne's men is the son of a famous soldier but has been so brainwashed that he hates America, everything it stands for and the military. Its obvious that this guy represents what Wayne fears his son will be turned into by his wife: an anti-american/anti-military peacenik liberal weakling. Wayne is the pure image of the american fighting leader. He is a machine that crushes everyone in his path. He knocks one old troublemaker soldier around as an example and that brings the men into line. By the time they get to Iwo, Striker has built them into a fighting unit. No personalities, no thoughts except for battle, no fear. They have been perfectly prepared for the battle. And having accomplished his task, Striker is killed during the battle. His death teaches us as Americans a final and most important lesson. None of the men are important in their lives or what they do. Leaders are not important either. Whats important is that the corps as a big machine keeps going. Striker builds the new leaders in battle and then the torch is passed to them to go on and do the same thing. War builds character and burns away the phony idealogy of liberalism and peace. Great men like Sgt. Striker are not created in classrooms, they can only be created in war. 
This is a B movie which seems just right for a World War II movie. There is good acting and good writing. This is John Wayne's best war movie. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in this film. This film has both good war action and Hollywood-style romance 
When I saw this movie as a young boy, I loved it. I saw it later in life, having served 4 years in the USMC, and I found it way off the mark. I was very disappointed 
Admiral Nimitz was commenting on the marines' successful efforts to secure this very strategic island during the 36 day battle, starting on February 19, against this Japanese stronghold. Of the six marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi, only three survived, all of which led quiet lives afterwards, never boasting about their achievements; many of their comrades died there. This movie was made right after the war just when the U.S. government was considering nixing the marines. John Wayne was one of many who came to the rescue, and in the movie, he does so as the brave Sargeant Stryker. The marines were instrumental in taking the island, as the VHS version documents after the end of the actual film. This movie was one of my dad's favorite WWII films; my dad was only 16 at the time the war ended, yet had a friend who survived this battle, yet with the loss of one of his legs. Almost 7000 Americans died, many tens of thousands were wounded. The Japanese population on this small island was very nearly annihilated. John Wayne's first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor came from his role in this film. Though many of the actors in this film were well known in their day, the only one I had heard of was John Wayne, although I'm sure my dad would've known them all. The movie is very dated, over 50 years old. I didn't get really interested in the story until half way through in that it mainly depicts barracks life for the marines until their deployment. The actual battle takes up only a fraction of the movie's time, the majority of it more concerned with the personalities and conflicts within the corp pre-engagement. I had hoped the movie would contain more historical details than it did since I knew precious little about it; however, probably in 1949, most Americans knew all about it from the news, newspapers and from friends and relatives who knew of people who had fought there. (The quote from Nimitz was not in the movie, nor the historical facts). Still, the movie's a classic, and I can see why my dad loved it. We're not a marine family, but Semper Fi 
"Sands of Iwo Jima" was the first movie I ever saw in which John Wayne played a character who actually died, which was certainly one of the more shocking deaths I can remember ever seeing in a film. Wayne plays Sgt. John Marion Stryker and since Wayne's real name was Marion Michael Morrison there seems to be an additional level of identification between actor and character here, while the power of the name "Stryker" is obvious. Stryker seems a bully to the green recruits he is training to be U.S. Marines in 1943. When the men of the rifle squad learn that Stryker's wife had taken their son and left him they think they know the reason why the man who was once the epitome of the tough Marine has become such a martinet. Of course when Stryker and his men hit the beach at Tarawa and are fighting for their lives against the Japanese troops defending the island, they understand that his hard lessons are the difference being life and death in combat. Then comes the last hard nut to crack of the islands occupied by the Japanese, the volcanic island of Iwo Jima. As the officer briefing the troops says, "nobody knows exactly what they've got on this island, but they've had forty years to put it there." Director Allan Dwan takes advantage of actual combat footage from the documentaries "With the Marines at Tarawa" and "To the Shores of Iwo Jima" to provide an added dimension of realism to the battle sequences. The reenactment of the flag raising on Iwo Jima involved Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, and John Bradley, the only three Marines in the celebrated photograph who survived the battle. Since this is a Hollywood war movie Stryker's rifle squad consists of not just new recruits but a few veterans, including Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), an old enemy who is perfectly willing to bad mouth the sergeant at every opportunity, even after he is taken out behind the tents by Stryker to be reminded who is running the outfit. The recruit who absorbs all of this venom the most is young Peter Conway (John Agar), whose father was Stryker's Commanding Officer at Guadalcanal. The old man felt his son was too soft to be a Marine (he reads books and went to college) and the kid resents the particular interest Stryker is taking in his training. Even when Stryker saves Conway's life when the kid is too busy reading a love letter to notice a live grenade gets loose during a training exercise, Conway refuses to show gratitude. So in addition to their relationship and sergeant and private Stryker and Conway are playing out their own familial relationship problems with each other as well. It is in battle that Stryker is at his best, blowing up a Japanese bunker to save trapped Marines, and once he proves himself to be a warrior god his squad, now tested in battle, finally becomes a true band of brothers. But "The Sands of Iwo Jima" has the elements of a Greek tragedy and at the moment of his apotheosis the hero must fall. Adding insult to injury the blow comes from behind and the shot of a bullet hole beneath Stryker's stenciled name on the back of his fatigues is even more powerful than the reenactment of the raising of the second American flag on Mt. Surabachi. This is not the best war movie of 1949; that honor goes to William Wellman's "Battleground," which remains one of the very best of the best in the World War II genre. Wayne was nominated for Best Actor, the only other time he was up for an Oscar besides "True Grit," although he arguably gave a better performance that same year in his previous film "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon." Despite the pair of strong performances by the Duke the Academy Award went to Broderick Crawford for "All the King's Men," but "Sands of Iwo Jima" remains Wayne's best WWII movie and one of the few that stands up with his classic westerns." 
I am neither a fan nor a detractor of John Wayne, but it's true many of his movies I have trouble finishing -- they just don't capture my interest very well. This movie is an exception. I find myself watching this one repeatedly. I understand the Marine Corps had some misgivings about their story being told by a B-movie studio (Republic), but I think this film brings that studio great credit. Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for this film, and in restrospect, I think he should have won (Jose Ferrer won that year). This movie has quite satisfactory subplots, more than passable acting, some nice crisp, intelligent dialog in places, and some characterizations that can evoke the interest and sympathy of the audience. The scene where Stryker (Wayne) visits the apartment of a woman he meets in a bar is particularly edifying. This is a surprisingly good movie, and it's wearing well over the years. I hate to nitpick, but there is an error or two on these pages concerning the historical accuracy of this film -- which also is surprisingly good; it's clear the film's makers were as careful as they could be. The landing craft at Tarawa in the film are LVTs (Landing Vehicle, Tracked), and this is correct for the first wave. The planners of the assault knew these would be important to surmount the reef, but their numbers were limited, so ensuing waves used LCVPs which could not cross the reef, and these are the troops who were slaughtered while wading in. Also, the movie correctly portrays the Marines in training for this assault as being stationed in New Zealand. Furthermore, the actual ascent of Suribachi was indeed relatively easy after five or so tortuous days of preparation -- but most of the carnage lay ahead; the battle was just getting warmed up. About 15% of USMC combat fatalities from 1776 through the Gulf War (1991) occured on Iwo Jima. This movie succeeds very nicely to tell an important war story without unnecessary violence, and some touching love relationships without lewdness. As an ex-Marine, and pretty serious student of the Pacific War, I like this movie 
This video reminds people of how Bo Jackson, regarded by a lot as the best athlete in American sports history, played during his prime. Interviews were not interesting, but there were indeed a lot of precious footage about his college career when he won the Heisman Trophy, his major league adventure and NFL highlights. Most notable were Bo's 'walking on the wall' catch, amazing outfield assists, home run during 89 MLB all star game, 'running-into-tunnel' after TD, as well as the 'play' that triggered his injury and retirement. All in all, you would like it if you like Bo. He was in fact the kind of superhuman people talked about. Just Awesome 
I really love this video. It has Bo's entire career including video of Bo playing football &amp; baseball in high school, college &amp; professionally. It was about Bo making a video about Bo. Bo played the part of the Director &amp; all the stage hands. This was all very cute &amp; funny but the sports footage was authentic--including interviews with friends, relatives &amp; fellow atheletes. This video also included some of the commercials that Bo did for television. So keep watching at the end, because this comes after the main part is over. Remember the 2 different commercials where there were several Bo's in the same picture? One of the most awesome videos of all time. Please make this video available again, because everyone I show it to would love to have one of their own 
This is a movie unlike anything you have ever seen before. The concepts and possibilities it presents are life altering. The presentation is entertaining, educational, and enlightening. Not to be missed by any person who considers themselves to be progressive or open-minded. Five Stars 
I found this to be an inspiring, thoughtful, and extremely interesting take at the new paradigm of science, quantum mechanics. This movie explains in non-technical terms the philosophical ramifications of the theory (almost universally accepted) and how it is relevant to our everyday lives--even non-physicists. In it are interviews of many well credentialed and credible physicists, philosophers, and theologians, making it engaging for even the most cynical of viewers. Interspersed is a drama showing the theories in action for a regular person. For me, it helps to reconcile spirituality (Christian in my case) and scientific theory whereas before I always felt my love of science and reason were in constant conflict with my spiritual beliefs. No longer! Watch the movie, which is for the most part not dogmatic and not judgmental but instead eye-opening and logically satisfying even for the "religious." I love it 
I had previously bought the 1st version. Liked it very much. So I was eagerly looking forward to this latest version. Happy to know that this version has more new Science related information - which was what I was interested in. And for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist, there is a seperate section entirely on Interviews. The best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations. For those who have not seen the 1st version, I think it is alright to watch this. Viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie. The interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer. Everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world, universe and what they are made of. If you had deep question about the reality, you might find an answer in this movie. -- Ravi, Singapor 
If you loved "What the Bleep Do We Know" you will love "What the Bleep Down the Rabbit Hole." All your favorite academic types appear, with more indept talk about Quantum theory. The expansiveness of the mind and the capacity of creating our own reality plus the challenge of otherness, parallel universes is the dose of what is possible I welcome. I watch either DVD at least monthly. The description of addiction, and how this traps us is another lecture I welcome. The capacity to see life as what I shape it, what I bring to the experience from a consciousness in expanded reality,what I can create is thrilling, and I feel this possibility after viewing either DVD. The only draw back in ". . . Down the Rabbit Hole" is the story line with Marlee Matlin. I would have enjoyed watching that develop and move into the future, instead of rehashing the "Bleep's" story. This is why I gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars. 
This film will change the way you perceive the "natural" world. It's very well done and brings very complicated concepts to light in a simple and comprehensive way. Truly, it's one of the best films I've ever seen 
Its a great movie. It really challenges one to look beyond...What IF............. 
This film allows you to explore places in your heart and mind that you never knew existed. This film is for all those who have questions. It offers ideas, and encourages the viewer to seek his/her own answers. Although a documentary, the film captures the eyes and sucks you in. Professional commentary is done with taste and is integral to the goal of the film. I recommend this film to anyone who wonders, "What is truely reality?"...and "What is this life all about?" 
Simply Fantastic! Anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this. Some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children. 
This DVD is explaining things better than the previous version, where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc. Some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained. The crytal-photography on water meditated upon by the Japanese monk was especially awesome. They have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western(modern)science .... ofcourse.....it ends in letting you ponder....they have left most of it there. There after one has to go into religion and spirituality - particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the "Sanathana Dharma" teachings 
This is one of the most admirable and fresh films of any age. A true tour de force that invites us to enjoy and delight with the joy of living. Renoir the son, paid a more than deserved to his father with this post card movie, plenty of smart situations with a wonderful Jean Gabin and the most beautiful woman in the world in those ages: Maria Felix. The film is a glorious homage to Paris, depicting minuciously through every little frame every angle of this lovely city through anorigibal stage: since I got it in 1990, I have to watch it at least once every year. A colossal and superb artistic film that finds in Renoir the perfect director in the peak of his creative powers. This is the artistic answer given by France to "An american in Paris", and John Huston's"Le Moulin Rouge". Versatile imaginative, sumptuos and ravishing fil 
From the start, I blatantly refuse to compare this film to Huston's "Moulin Rouge" - these are two distinctly seperate works, and though their subject might be the same, it would be a disservice to the merits of both to place them on the same page. That having been said... From the great storyline to the rip-roaring dance finale, this is one heck of a movie-musical. Far, far too obscure, at least in this country - I've told innumerable friends about it, always with the same result - they tell me they've never heard of it. Well, now that you have, it's very well worth your time to check it out. Firstly, the character development is fantastic. Jean Gabin shines as the impresario Danglard, Francoise Arnould is wonderful as his ingenue/inspiration Nini, and Maria Felix is devastating as the diva, La Belle Abesse. As well, look for the glittering talents that surround - the peripheral characters are a delight to behold. And, of course, the great Edith Piaf makes a brief appearance, as well. Another quality I love about this film is the relatively accurate depiction of 1890's Paris - the costumes, colors and attitudes are well captured. The truth of the "casting couch" is openly mentioned, and relationships between performers and impresario are depicted with often saddening accuracy. On a lighter note, the dances are captured beautifully, as well - throughout the film they shine, in rehearsal rooms, dingy bars, and, of course, in the aforementioned finale. Overall, this is a most enjoyable film - and, unlike many "golden age" Hollywood musicals, it doesnt' shy away from the ugly truths of life in the theatre. Well worth a viewing - and very well worth purchase 
3 stars for the movie, plus a bonus star to the director for being a genius. How you ask? It's all about Paul Walker. Man do I love that guy. Absolute worst actor in Hollywood, but still gets part after part. His acting style is like a piece of wood with constipation. But he's just bad enough to be lovable. People still like him despite his failing, not like Hayden Christenson (Anakin from Star Wars), who just needs to die. Anyways, so the director is sitting and thinking: "Hmmm... Paul Walker's in this movie. How do I distract people from his god awful acting enough so they'll still like it?" Then the answer hits him like a sledge hammer to the head. Get a super ridiculously hot woman to play along side him! Enter Jessica Alba. In a bikini. Think any guy is watching Paul Walker any more? And that handles half the audience at least. Now if that isn't enough, we also have pirates, sharks, mantas, and other sea creatures who consequently get addicted to cocaine, and lots of underwater shots of our illustrious stars diving for treasure / drugs. Also, putting Paul Walker underwater for much of the film erases the need for him to talk. Bonus 
Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested. Of course, aside from the beautiful underwater photography, there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world. Jessica Alba looks incredible. Ashley Scott is also gorgeous. And for the ladies, there's Paul Walker and Tyson Beckford. I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it is entertaining and fun 
This movie had a better story than I expected, the action was pretty good, and of course, Jessica... 
If you like to be entertained this film is worth renting and if you are a big fan, like I am, of Jessica Alba this film is worth buying. I didn't see this film at the theater, but after renting it, I immeadiately bought it. You can read the other reviews here from the psuedo-critics who pan the film, but the bottom line here is: Was the film entertaining? The answer to that question is yes! The reason why most of us go see a film in the first place is to be entertained, and this film delivers! If you are someone who likes to have fun and likes to be entertained I guarantee you will enjoy this film 
Finally a good remake that is a little different. What makes a movie is the scenery, least my opinion. Scenery was beautiful. But the deep was a classic but the updated version is good for the new age crowd which makes sens 
Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the Bahamas waiting for that day when they'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems. When Jared's old friend Bryce (Scott Caan) arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship Zephyr. Unfortunately, the Zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying 800 kilos of cocaine... cocaine its owner (James Frain) wants back. Into The Blue has Great Acting, Good Directing, Great Special Effects, and Good Writing. Let me start off with saying I definitely prefer Paul Walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves I'm right. The Acting in this film has got to be its strongest point Jessica Alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and Paul Walker does a great job as well. Scoot Cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk! The Special Effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff. The Writing and Directing were also very good but I believe the Acting stood out the most. Overall if you like Jessica Alba or Paul Walker or Underwater Adventures You'll love this movi 
..without jessica alba.let's imagine the same film as "the deep" with jacqueline Bisset...a real sexy looking woman not a " teenager chica lookalike"with very poor acting..It seems the same director had a better choice in "blue crush". The rest is absolutly great and represents a great moment of adventures. buy i 
I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target.... craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation.... The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie. The scenery was indeed spectacular. The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered. Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful. OK, enough of the shallow stuff.... the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well. The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc. Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives. Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks? No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day. 
One of the best movies I've seen. Everybody does a great job in portraying this sensitive material in a very real and gutsy way. I've seen this movie three times, I think, and each time have found it not only entertaining, but reminding that, as a society, we still have a lot of work to do on healing our human need for hatred and fear 
Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
Grisham once said he wrote his other books, e.g., The Firm, et al., so he could afford to write important books, like this one, upon which the movie s based. Matthew McConaghey gives a fantastic performance--and why hasn't Hollywood ever--EVER--given him another part this good! Thought provoking, great acting, great story, highly recommen 
If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you. It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause 
With a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit...I found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me...this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers. The story is a brutally honest one about racism in Mississippi in the year 1995. A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held. The film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly, Jake (McConaughey) as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed KKK as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty. The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined. Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through. Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Keifer Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd and Chris Cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast 
THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you. A Time to kill's plot is pretty simply explained. In the deep south, a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks, who almost kill her. A young white lawyer and father (Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance) is sickened at the news, and doesn't quite know what to think when the little girl's father (Sammuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey) pays him a visit and asks if he'd "help him if he were in a tight spot". The next day as the two redneck/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment, Carl Lee Hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher. Jake Brigance agrees to defend Hailey as his murder trial begins. The insanity plea is used to "give the jury an excuse to aquit" But in my opinion, I think it was quite legitimate. What father WOULDN't be driven insane under the circumstances? the rest of the movie is Carl Lee Hailey's trial and the surrounding Drama as KKK violence emerges led by Kiefer Sutherland, and Jake's life and home are in danger, his relationship with his wife strained, and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle. My favorite scene? It might come as a surprise, but my favorite scene is when the Prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial. He was caught in the knee by a stray bullet, and now has half a leg. After the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against Carl Lee, and establish unerring identity of the shooter, The Defence asks him two questions. "Do you think Carl Lee intentionally shot you?" "No" "Do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did?" "He did what I would have done." but it doesn't end there as the Policeman (remember he's missing a leg because of what Carl Lee Hailey Did) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like Carl Lee did. He starts screaming to the jury to "turn him loose, He's a hero!" I think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes (albeit there are many others too) (Great acting by Chris Cooper as the policeman) Anyway.. forgive if I rambled. I love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas... star studded casts.. John Grisham...suspense thrillers..just all around good movies.. You need to see this. 
Every writer is important. A writer that has views, characters, and exciting trial cases. This movie is originally based off of john grisim's first novel. A novel that he sturggled to get out there and then finally had it self-published. It's a powerful story that has a very dark setting. There's rascism, there's fights, there's deaths. Everything that this wolrd wants to avoid. I think samuel jackson played a really powerful performacne and I hope he got an oscar for this role. Just to warn you, though, that there are images in here that are hard to see. I , myself, fastforwarded one scene because I couldn't handle it. It's near the begining. But I hope you people enjoy the cast of characters and get captured by this huge story 
This is by far John Grisham's best books and movies of all. Although this was John's first book, it wasn't successful until one of more of his other books became successful. After the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list. Then comes the subject of making this book into a movie. When John Grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie, he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive. He felt that without his input, the movie could not reflect what Grisham was trying to present in the book. After several of John Grisham's books were made into movies and were successful, I knew it was only a matter of time before "A Time To Kill" would be on the big screen. This movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because John Grisham had some influence over the production. The movie has an all star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. This movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years. This DVD should be apart of everyone's movie collection. As this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come, the movie will also be. 
John Grisham's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the South was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by Joel Schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman. The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit. Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility. Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias. Recommended.

John Grisham's novel, "A Time to Kill" is closly adapted into a major motion picture by director Joel Schumacher. Rated "R" for language and violent content (including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl), the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of "A" list stars. Samuel L. Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment. Young and inexperienced local attorney, Jake Brigance (played by Matthew McConaughey in one of his first major roles) agrees to defend Carl Lee against the smarmey District Attroney Rufus Buckley (played by Kevin Spacey). Brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of Sandra Bullock (playing a well-to-do law student), Oliver Platt (a morally devoid divorce attorney) and Donald Sutherland (a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave Brigance his first job). As the plot builds, the community begins to takes sides in the case. The KKK is called in to intimidate Carl Lee's defense team and the NAACP enters to counteract the Klan's actions. In some reviews, the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable. This reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book. Without revealing any key plot details, let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the Deep South in a accurate way. There's plenty of action, few down moments and sparkling performances by a great cast! If you liked the book, you will enjoy "A Time to Kill". 
"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films I've ever seen. I only saw this once and that was awhile ago, but I do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been. Richard Gere (yeah, I know) plays a Washington Post reporter named John Klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident. After the accident which is purposely filmed so that we don't know how or why it really happened, his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth. She keeps asking Klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not, a kind of Dracula-like figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable. At first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures, the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on. Will Patton has to be the best actor in this movie. He plays Gordon Smallwood, outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses. When Klein shows up at Gordon's house (and has a rifle shoved in his face), it is not by accident. Nothing in this movie really is. The way Pellington shoots the scenes of Gordon losing his mind is unforgettable--it happens in a fizzy, weird video game type way which comes off very vividly. I've never liked Laura Linney too much and have always felt she belongs on TV but she does a decent job as Connie Mills, the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for Klein's breakdowns as the REAL star of the movie--Indrid Cold--keeps calling him. Only in "The Exorcist" or "Black Christmas", perhaps, have I seen a movie before in which a creepy, otherworldly voice becomes the star. Even when Klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone, it keeps ringing and ringing. This is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope. The climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless. Bottom line: every horror fan should see this.  
I just read Dirk's "spolier" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh? Demonic, fallen angles? What? Did we watch the same movie? If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear. Unfortunately, the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely, and so the happenings at Point Pleasant lost their entire frame of reference. If you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened, you might come to the conclusion of the Mothman being evil, demonic, fallen angles, whatever you like. But if you research the incident at all, you'll see you're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie. And if, like Dirk, you thereby think you know all about what Mothman actually was based on just the movie alone, then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a Hollywood writer's imagination and script and nothing more. Mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be. Don't judge by the movie, read the book 
I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged. 
The Mothman Prophecies is a throwback to the time when "horror movie" didn't actually mean "Teenage Gore Fest." I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does. Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurances; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life. The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares. And only a PG-13 rating. Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated "tricks" like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much. The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime. If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length. Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months. Get it while you can. * * * * * * * * * * Rating: Solid A + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + F.Y.I.: Although this film is rated only PG-13, it may be too scary or intense for children 15 and under 
"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of those rare films where everything magically 'works' resulting in a magnificent piece of cinematic art. Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post who is trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife. He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. They soon learn that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie moth-like entity, similar to the one Klein's wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this "mothman" is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late? "The Mothman Prophecies" is not a monster movie, nor is it a mad-slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinimatography, locations, etc. Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is touching in a very powerful way. I'll put it this way, if you appreciated "The Village," you'll love this one. The notable Amazon reviewer Lawrence Bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it about four or five times to finally discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have "ears to hear" and be willing to work for them. My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the "mothman" brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the "mothmen" are good in nature. I've come to see that this translation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring. [SPOILER ALERT -- Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen] The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)? The bible calls Satan the "prince of the power of the air," hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of "angels" and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones. The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders. The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millenia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. The saved police woman, number "37" (research that number), in the end is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive. The film powerfully reveals that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the movie ever reveals this). For more intriguing insights see Sam Damon Jr.'s outstanding review from October 27, 2002. [END SPOILER ALERT] "Mothman" ranks up there with my all-time favorite movies. 
This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE. 
Three problems with this film: 1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary. It's very boring. As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed. 2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging. The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes. Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole. The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting. 3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question. The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?" In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake. Don't waste your life. ALon 
I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed. I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident. The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller. The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based. Very interesting in its own right 
There are 77 reviews here already for "Cherfitness: A New Attitude" and the average rating is 5 stars. That is about right, and I'd like to add my 5 star rating as well. But I would say this is not for those who are just getting into workouts, or have been out of it for a while. For those I would suggest Jane Fonda's startup program for very beginners or "The Fix - A Dance workout" for coming back after being away for a while, which has 3 programs, to help you burn calories and firm up. However, if you have been doing aerobics for a while and want to step up the intensity of your work out, you will love the step work out here. You will burn more calories then with regular floor aerobics, and the instructor is one of the best. Keli Roberts. The Step Work out is the first of a 3-part class. Before the program begins, Cher will give a little pep-talk, and show a picture of three different levels you could do according to your level. For very beginning level step, you may not want to use a step at all. There is one girl in the class that does the entire routine without the steps. This will help in getting the moves down,and later you can add 6 inches to ten inches as you get stronger. Cher does an intermediate level at about 6 inches. You can always modify to your physical limitatins or even step up the intenseness of the workout by adding arms and then weights. Of course, you should probably check with your Doctor if you have any physical limitations. But the step is a very good low impact way to burn those calories baby. Of Course..you will need a step for this, and this is one of the only pieces of equipment that I will not improvise. it is important to have a properly made sturdy step that adjusts to different levels, and has a no slip top to it. The step workout is 38 minutes, which includes a dynamite warm-up,then moves you in all directions, and has some good abductions, then about 1/2 way through there is a heart rate check and a chart with your age group to make sure you are doing okay, and a nice cool down stretch at the end. Next up a short but intense ab work out. it is only 10 minutes, but highly effective. Keli will continually remind you of proper positioning for best results and no injury. She works upper and lower abs, and sides as well. There is also a little work for your back, which is excellent for strengthening.You may want to use a Yoga mat for the ab workout. Not just for comfort, but you'll be on your tummy for the back-work, and a mat will keep carpet fibers and dust away from your face. Last but not least a really tough leg workout. The hard stuff..Hips Buns and Thighs! Yeow...I could not get through it all at first. And Cher will remind you not to do more then you can. Build up to it. So Beginners, do what you can, intermediates, this should step up your workout. And Advanced...let's see those weights! This last workout is 32 minutes. The entire tape runs around, 90 minutes, but that includes, Cher's pep talks, warm ups and cool downs.But most of the time you will be working. Also if you feel you need more of a cool down or stretch, just pause it and go for it. I am splitting this tape into two sessions. The entire length is too much for me and my hip replacement. I also like to get a little more ab workout and I have another great workout with Keli Roberts called Quick-Fix Pilates Abs, that has 3 10 minute sessions, do 1 or all 3.(see my review). Cher has picked some music that is highly motivating and fun. You know when you warm up to "Born To Be Wild", your in for a good time. Cher cracks jokes, and yes in true form changes her outfit for each session. This workout has been around a long time, maybe 15 years, but if it ain't broken....well you know! Go for it. Remember to breathe, eat healthy, and enjoy....Laurie 
I love the step workout. If I only have 10 minutes to work out, I'll stretch first, then start wherever I last left the tape cued up. Music is great. Cher is good about cheering you on without being cutesy. I didn't even know the instructor was Kelli Roberts until I'd read one of the reviews...it doesn't list her name on the box at all. Now that I know who she is I want to get her 10 Minute Solution Kick Boxing workout 
This is one of my all time favorites and I have had it for years! I even bought a second copy as my first is wearing out... Keli Roberts is knowledgable, upbeat and motivating and her queuing is very good. The music is just right to keep you going and entertained, too. The abs section is short and very effective and the thigh workout is one of the best! This cardio and strength workout is great for beginners through advanced as you can add weights and increase the step height as you progress. 
This is BY FAR one of the best Step workouts I have ever done. Cher is delightful and Kelli Roberts is a first rate instructor,with excellent cuing and a serious,but fun,attitude. I did this workout when it first came out and it became my favorite. I have since lost my VHS and am reordering this workout,you know a workout is great if you remember it years later and buy it for the second time but this workout is that good. The Abs workout is tough but very effective and the thigh workout is the best,done while standing,which makes it effectively different. I love the music in this one! This is truly a 5 Star Workout,whether you are a Cher fan or not. Like many others,I only wish it was available on DVD 
In my rededication to attain a fit body, I reflected on what worked in the past. When I could not afford a gym membership, or could not get out to walk regularly, what sealed the deal for me was Cherfitness:A New Attitude. Cher was okay with her slender body and numerous wardrobe changes, but what really hooked me was Keli Roberts' fit and toned physique. I joyfully exercised with her everyday just so I could attain that fantastic body. I never looked like Keli but the results I received were amazing. I loved the music, the warmup was enough for me somedays because it was rather long. The step challenges put me in euphoric bliss and the lower body segment put my greatest asset in great shape. I'm chucking the gym membership because the commute time is too much and I'm re-ordering Cherfitness to roll with her and Keli. After all these years, Cherfitnesss: A New Attitude still rocks!! 
This is a fantastic workout! I bought it back in 1991 when the step craze was just getting heated up in my neck of the woods. I stopped doing step aerobics when my aerobic step bit the dust (I just didn't bother to buy a new one.) My workout for a number of years then became walking and running. But recently (March, 2006) I dragged out my old video and bought a new step, as our local weather wasn't conducive to keeping up my walking/running routine. I was amazed at how much I still loved this workout! I was also amazed at how quickly I caught back on to the workout, much like riding a bicycle, one never forgets! Not only does the video contain a great aerobic step workout, but two other sections devoted to muscle toning and specific areas of the body. If someone does this entire workout, then they've really gotten a great workout for their entire body! No, it's not as polished as some other workout dvds and videos...but then again, it's not as boring either. The music is upbeat and are actually REAL songs that one would know, rather than monotonous muzak. This, at least for me, helps to get my mind off of the workout and helps me to enjoy what I'm doing. The tape is a bit dated in that the participants are wearing some not-so-typical workout garb, but who really cares? You're getting a great workout, the music is great, the instructions are clear (Keli eases the viewer into each and every step and combination of steps) and the attitude throughout the video is very positive. Cher's narrative comments that appear before each segment and which are dubbed over and throughout the workouts, plus Keli's instruction, are all very encouraging, letting you know that you CAN do this workout. The banter that goes on during the workouts (not a lot, just a little) is upbeat and fun and encouraging. I feel when I'm doing this workout that I'm in a REAL step aerobic class with friends, not watching some slick version of a workout with android instructors and participants with bodies that never sweat, smiles that never fade, or instructors that assume that you're a step aerobic expert. The people on this video, in spite of being celebrities (Keli, Cher, and Dori Sanchez, for example) are real people, doing a real workout. You see them groan and sweat and concentrate and focus...and smile and laugh, too...but all along, they are encouraged by their instructor and by Cher. This video consists of a 38 minute step aerobic routine, with adequate warmup...a 12 minute abs and back workout, with lots of crunches and isolated exercises (tough but good and brief)...and a 36 minute superbly difficult lower body workout. I would recommend this video to anyone, from beginner to experienced "stepper." I just can't understand why most workout videos/dvds aren't using REAL music instead of boring muzak and why most workout video/dvd instructors can't be more personal in their delivery/instruction. This workout is a world apart from other workout videos/dvds out there. It is a workout that you will NOT get bored with. What good is a workout if you're going to get bored or discouraged, and quit? Maybe it will someday be released on dvd, but in the meantime, if you want to get a great workout, buy this tape! I started doing it on a lark, in response to some crummy weather interferring with my daily walk/run routine, now I find myself doing it every day! My heart rate gets sufficiently up (too up, sometimes...I'm so enthused by the workout!), I sweat like a pig, and at the end, am very proud of myself and my efforts. I'm hooked! Kudos to Cher and to Keli! 
After reading so many rave reviews, I decided to buy this video. I owe many, many workout videos and this is the most boring by far. I have never been able to complete it. Very dissapointing! 
I just recently dug this video out of my archives and did the step workout. Truly a classic in terms of a challenging step workout, good music, fun moves and motivation. And sadly, better than a lot of the more recent exercise tapes and DVDs I've acquired. I wish this would be re-released to DVD so I won't wear out my tape copy 
I have been using this tape for years, and it is one of my favorites. It is divided into 3 different sections; approximately 38 minutes of step aerobics, 10 minutes abs/back, and 32 minutes hips, thighs, and buns. All of the classes are led by Keli Roberts, a renowned fitness instructor. The step class is fun, but can be a challenge, especially if you're new to step aerobics. However, each woman in the video is doing a modified version, in regards to the height of step platform, no step at all, with or without arm movements, and with or without light hand weights. Keli's cuing is great, and the moves are broken down to where you have enough of a chance to learn them and become comfortable with them before the next one is taught. At the same time, there are some moves which can prove confusing and may frustrate someone who's new to the routine, such as transitioning across the step, and repeating the routine on the opposite side before crossing back over again. In effect, doing this helps you to alternately work each leg, but it might be confusing at first until you get into the flow of things. The ab section is great, and 10 minutes is just enough time. The movements are very slow and controlled, so you work the muscles hard. It's probably one of my favorite ab routines out of all of the videos I own. Lastly, there is the hips, thighs, and buns section. You do a lot of standing leg work; squats, leg presses, etc. They are very tough and you may need to work up to some of the repetitions. Then, there is some floor work; leg lifts for both inner and outer thighs. Usually, I do the step and abs class, or the abs and legs class. I don't know that I'd have the energy to do all 3 classes in one day. It's easier to break things up. But nevertheless it's a great workout 
This is an incredible workout! My entire family does this and has for the past 14 years (since it came out in '91). None of us do the step aerobics anymore because we're not interested, but the abs and legs/butt/thighs sections are great. They'll make you SO sore you know it's working. A lot of my friends have started buying this video 
I rented this movie, and I might buy it if the price goes below $10. It certainly is worth watching. There is no graphic sex, which is nice. The acting is good. It weaves drama, humor, and real-life situations throughout. At times, the British accents are hard to understand. It is one of the few decent gay movies out there 
perfect I thought it wouldnt work here in brazil, but it worked! it arrived one week before the first day of the period they suggested perfect! I'm very satisfied. patric 
Overwhelming in sincerity and pain. To watch and observe Stephan's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time. This cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves. Combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour I was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish. A great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list. 
In lieu of the recent fury for the highly appraised movie Brokeback Mountain, I went and bought this movie. I have seen Get Real a few years back but completely forgotten about it until today. A happier movie than Brokeback Mountain, it basically addresses the same issue of two men falling in love (except Get Real is about teenagers),one man willing to accept and embrace his sexuality, the other hiding because of society's constraints. I like Get Real better than Brokeback Mountain. No one gets killed at the end, and the boy who comes out, possibly gets a better life (the movie ends abruptly with no epilogue). They should have presented what happened to both boys or make a sequel 
This film is great! Charlotte Brittain (Linda) is a breath of fresh air. Ben Silverstone (Steven) is very authentic and charming in his own way. At first I thought that this movie was going to be hokey because of the title. Just like a book, never judge something by its cover. "Get Real" wasnt implying the cliche expression, it was redefining it. Not only is this film entertaining but it could also be a powerful tool to help encourage people who are dealing with similar issues. 
I was not going in bathrooms looking for dudes when I was younger. But I certainly was in the same predictment. I'm a 20 year old gay male, and I still have problems talking to my parents about it. I will say this movie is an accurate depiction of my own life. I was not exactly a geek, but I was not very popular in high school. People knew about my sexuality and pushed me around. I found my first love in one of the most hottest, handsome guy in school. And he told me that he too was gay and it went on from there. I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was beautiful and so was the storyline. It is just what I love in a movie. I also recommend Beautiful Thing for others.. those brits really produce great coming out movies... 
This movie not too close to reality, but one of the best. I like it a lot and its still in my hart and mind on next day after watching. I think I will see it today in the evening again 
Get Real is a story of young love and accepting who you are. Steve (Ben Silverstone)is gay and comfortable with it, even though he is only out to his neighbor, Linda (Charlotte Brittain). Because he is afraid that the boys at school will abuse him even more if they know he's gay, Steve's relationships consist of one-night stands with guys he meets in the park. This is how he meets the local big-man-on-campus, John (Brad Gorton). This film portrays high school 'society' very realistically and the interactions between the characters is very genuine. Get Real includes the awkward silences, the social fumblings, the excitement of a first love, and the heartbreak that everyone, gay or straight, went through in high school. All of the actors deserve high marks for their performances, especially Silverstone and Gorton. The scenes after the dance and after the awards ceremony are so honest and raw that they break my heart every time. Their frank portrayals are what make this unassuming little film one that everyone needs in their collection 
Director Sam Raimi crafts this story from the best seller. Set in a cold, wintry rural landscape, Brothers Hank (smart accountant Bill Paxton) and Jacob (dim-witted Billy Bob Thornton), along with Jacob's equally dumb friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), find a downed plane full of four million dollars. The pilot is dead and no one else knows about it. Could it be drug money? Sounds simple. However, family, greed and common sense don't always mix and the story soon goes haywire. No need to give away anything else other than there is an unexpected body count and an ending that will shock. This is one of those sleeper hits that never fails to surprise and delight. Bridget Fonda costars as Paxton's wife who goes through her own metamorphosis. 
Director: Sam Raimi Cast: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe, Jack Walsh, Chelcie Ross, Becky Ann Baker, Gary Cole, Bob Davis. Running Time: 121 minutes Rated R for violence and language. This is a diabolical tale about the wages of greed. Although it is played straight without intentional humor, the irony is so delicious at times that you might find yourself laughing. Jacob Mitchell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the one who begins to feel evil, and rightly so as the bodies begin to pile up. His presumably smarter brother Hank (Bill Paxton) feels mostly fear as he struggles to cover up one mishap after another. Their problems begin when they and Jacob's buddy Lou Chambers (Brent Briscoe) stumble onto a downed airplane in the woods covered with snow in which they find one dead person being feasted on by crows and a duffle bag full of hundred dollar bills. Lou, who might represent the common man, says, let's keep it. Hank, who could be rational man, says, whoa, this money belongs to somebody and besides we could get into trouble. We better turn it in. And Jacob, who is the natural man, sides with his buddy Lou. After all they're country poor and this is probably drug money that nobody is going to miss. And anyway, what can go wrong? Well, as Ben Franklin observed a long time ago, `Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.' As they wait for spring to come and the plane to be discovered before they risk spending the money, the `simple plan' begins to unravel with horrific consequences. Thornton and Briscoe play country boys to perfection, and Paxton does a great job as a small town golden boy seriously compromised. Bridget Fonda plays Hank's pregnant wife, who turns out to be the brains (as it were) of the group. There are some very nice plot twists as the all too human emotions of the characters begin to crash into one another. Inevitably we have a morality tale in which the wages of sin are fully realized. Sam Raimi's ("The Evil Dead", "Spiderman) direction captures well the atmosphere of North Country America without any obvious straining for effect. He gets great mileage out of a few crows (actually some of them are ravens, I think) and a whole lot of snow. Scott B. Smith's script (from his novel) is clever and morally astute. The characterizations are excellent and the story psychologically satisfying. Particularly agreeable was the very sad, ironic end for Hank and his wife, who find that all the self-created hell they went through led them back to where they began, but without their souls. A dark message about greed and honesty is a topsy-turvey roller-coaster ride with beautiful cinematography and slick direction from horror-master Raimi. Not one for those who need a cheering-up session. 
A friend of mine told me to watch this movie. We were talking about things that can get really bad, and just go out of control. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch. I prefer those girly movies. Oh mine! The movie was so good! I couldn't stop watching. It got so late and I had to come back the next day to finish watching, I was so eager to know the ending of the movie. Billy Bob represented his movie character so well. It is a dark, very interesting movie 
***** I liked this film a lot. It was entertaining, suspenseful, and made me think. It's staying with me and I'm continuing to think about it. "A Simple Plan" asks the question, "What if you found $4.4 million in a gym bag in the woods...would you keep it...what if you thought there was a reasonably good chance you'd never get caught...that no one would ever know?" This is what happens to the central characters. The DVD cover advertises, "Sometimes good people do evil things." Once they make their decision, and plan their plan, the movie illustrates how consequences happen that are completely unanticipated. Bill Paxton plays the main character and is wonderful as a typical "good" middle-class accountant in a small rural town. Bridget Fonda does an excellent job as his wife, who is very idealistic and moralistic until she realizes that the scenario is not hypothetical---in fact, she has to decide what to do, and she makes decisions different from what I would have expected. Billy Bob Thornton is predictably great, of course, playing a rural man (the main character's brother) who has never had a chance in the town he lives in and just wants to truly have a life, and in his own way, do what is right; he is handicapped, however, by his intelligence, his eccentricity, and his background. I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, and since I'm a person more like his brother, it was fascinating to see how he lived and thought...as the movie progressed, his middle-class brother gained empathy for the difficult life he led, too. I didn't think that any of the pacing was slow, as other reviewers have said. I thought that the starkness and the pacing fit in beautifully with the movie and it gave me a chance to process what was going on. One moral decision led to another, and each of them made me think "Would I do that?" and "Could I do that?" It made me see how seductive certain crimes in certain circumstances can be to any one of us. This is a quality, very suspenseful, provocative film. I think it would be equally enjoyable for men and women but definitely not for children at all, as the themes are very heavy and mature. There are no special features or subtitles. I generally like subtitles, but they are not necessary in this film for hearing people, as everyone speaks very clearly. I cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie. There is some violence, but none of it is gratuitous. I generally really dislike violence in movies, but it was worth it for the experience I took away after watching it. ***** 
Contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has NO subtitles or closed captions or whatever. The R2 neither. So again, don't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff. Non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format, no subs, not available at all (yes I mean you, Disney)... In short, no quality or consistency. Go and take a hike. Stop lobbying for legislation and start making real DVD's 
this is the perfect shakespearean drama: in the middle of winter, when all color is reduced to black, grey and white, just like the tight plot reduced to the essentials: the ravens, gloom onlookers on every dramatic turn. bridget fonda the perfect lady macbeth, horrid yet utterly authentic with a baby in her arm while plotting each murder. bill paxton, your wished-for neighbor and pal, open-faced yet capable of cold-blooded murder; billy bob thornton as his retarded brother, retarded and yet the only one who truly understands the situation and its implications. the only one, too, who stays true to his beliefs. it is one of the very few movies out there where violence is not just exploited in order to glue viewers to the screen but is absolutely necessary to emphasize the course of events. a "simple" drama: a simple plan. 
Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese. This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert. I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction. Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly. When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point? The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory. And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense. One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch. 
Two brothers and a friend stumble across a crashed airplane full of cash (4.4 million dollars, to be precise) in the snowy woods. Our wise hero, played by Bill Paxton, devises a simple plan in which they can lay low with the cash to determine if anyone is looking for it, then move out of town and split the bounty. If only he could control everything... The bag o' cash is just a starting point for this riveting morality tale. The bottom line is that one lie always leads to another, and our little trio, plus the wives, get in deeper and deeper. There are bound to be crossed loyalties in a group of three--the brothers have family ties, and the friend is loyal to only one of the brothers (the Billy Bob Thornton character). A push-and-pull over the loyalty of Thornton's character ensues. Each man has different family and work pressures, and not all are as patient as the one who devised the clear-headed simple plan. It's captivating to watch money change the motives and behaviors of these men. The real star is Billy Bob Thornton, playing the down-and-out loser Jacob. He's a nobody in town, a generally recognized screw-up, but he is truly the philosopher of the group. He has very simple desires of resurrecting his dead father's farm, and he can't imagine taking the cash and leaving the only town he's ever known. In the end, he plays the only man with a conscience. My chief complaint with both the movie and the novel of the same name is the way the Sarah character goes through a complete personality change. She's two completely different people at different points in the movie, and her change in behavior isn't well-explained. All other characters, however, are exceptionally well-developed. 
Good performance by Billy Bob Thornton. A lot of outside scenes shot on location in northern Minnesota in the dead of winter 
For a plot synopsis please read the Amazon review. I wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film. As a longtime fan of both Sam Raimi (of the Evil Dead series) and Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister), I went to see this on opening night. Not many people can claim this I'm sure because it was and is, such a small film that received next to no marketing. For shame. This film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, both made by the Cohen brothers. Film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers, so I won't bother to get into that. Should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them, I suggest you stop reading and immediately rent A SIMPLE PLAN. If not, keep reading and I will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant. And why I hope you will take a look at it. A SIMPLE PLAN is, at its core, about four people. And underneath all the plot devices and twists, it's about how they relate to one another. Notice I did't say characters, because this film doesn't have actors simply delivering dialogue. It's about people you get to know, understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas. Sure, finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device, but the heart of this film is much simpler than that. It's about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it. And being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process. That's what gives this film such depth. You watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash. And in the end it falls apart for two reasons: the details and the human factor. They say the Devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime. As for the human factor, where greed is concerned, people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person's greed while are unable satisfy their own. In many respects this film is almost an homage to BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, but in many ways I think it is superior. I often draw the comparison by a scene which is both A SIMPLE PLAN and BLOOD SIMPLE where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of. And even afterwards, after the emotional toll the has been taken, once one evil act is committed, another is sure to follow. It's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera, frantically going over the details in their mind, all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute. Bill Paxton does this better than anyone. He is such a likable man (both in the film and in life) that you can't help but feel sorry for the mess he has created. His entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime, keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife. That may make them all sound malicious, but really the opposite is actually true. They're all normal folks, like we've all seen a hundred times. And in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in. After all, were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss, what would you do? But then again, nothing is ever that simple 
I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
I love John Grisham books, and though I've not read the Rainmaker, I do thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a David and Goliath story about an underprivileged family and a greener than grass lawyer taking on the mega-insurance company. (And believe it or not, I work for an insurance company!) The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film. The subplot of Rudy's love interest is a bit more than the movie really needs...I'd be interested to see if that portion exists or how it plays out in the book. Overall though, if you're looking for a nice solid movie, I'd recommend this one 
I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody 
Pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of John Grisham and bring it all onto the screen. They do a pretty good job. Matt Damon plays Rudy, a student in law school who's smart, broke, and about to make history. In the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer. The policy covered it but they would just not pay. Meantime Damons character is in deeper than ever, as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out. Read the novel, then watch the movie. It's really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving. Danny DeVito plays Damons partner in the film and it's one of the better roles I've seen him play. 
I loved this movie. Matt Damon, Clare Danes, Danny DeVito and especially Teresa Wright, give great performances 
It's a good story- it keeps the pace moving, and inserts nice little scenes of humor. And the best part? It's so close to the actual book. 
This is a great movie! Matt Damon is so great in this part of a Southern Lawyer starting out, and Mickey Rourke and Danny Devito are perfectly cast as the supporting partners to Matt's role. I love this movie and have already watched it over and over. A must see. 
This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Read the book if you want the backstory since the screenplay starts at the half point. It's entertaining and that's why we see movies in the first place, right? Matt Damon is just so darn likeable, you get drawn into his narration right off the bat. The screenplay was very well done. It IS a Coppola film, after all...he does work with some talented people. It was very nice to see Theresa Wright in this film, as well. 
ITS YOUR CLASSIC BAD GUY GOOD GUY - GOOD GUY SAVES GIRL. THE major thumbs down about this movie was the "room mates" and the excess use of gutter language at times. What makes this a GOOD movie though is its realistic presentation of issues. I find that the honesty between the characters personalities drove the storyline and made for an overall interesting movie with a sarcastic overtone about the worlds rejection of truth, purity and innocence, both displayed in the Professer and the "room mates".Also worthy of note is the confusion the misplaced "MAIDEN IN DISTRESS" suffers from.Which leaves the masculine viewer completly relating to the "Loser" who is clearly the hero of the story. This would be a good movie to preach from. Leaving out comments made in the movie for SURE but by mainly pointing out the situations and CONSEQUENCES of substance abuse,the possible compromises that can be made all in the name of the $, amoung other youth issues also portrayed in the movie. IF ANYTHING enjoy the movie, recieve its warm humor and FEEL driven to support the under dog or all round nice guy next time you meet one. WILD AT HEART indeed! GS 
Loser is by far one of my favorite movies. I remember that there were only 3 other people in the theater when I saw it, though. I definitly does not get the attention it deserves. It's a cute story about a small town boy who moves to the big city, and he falls for the independent girl on the way. The movie is rather predictible as most teen movies are, but it a really funny and cute look at college life in NYC 
Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie: puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)? Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)? What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)? Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad. Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy. Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease. In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind. Isn't that what movie making is all about? 
This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country? I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc. I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please. Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died. I kept expecting someone to call Social Services. And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children. And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all. Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
"In America" takes hold of you right from the beginning,squeezes your heart, and never lets go. A poor family enters this Country illegally, with dreams of a better life for thier family (A young Mother and Father, and thier 2 young daughters) They move smack in the middle of Brooklyn in the middle of an unbearably hot summer. We experience just about every human emotion there is as this story unfolds, and what a wonderful story it is! We see this masterpiece through the eyes (and camera) of the 11 year old girl. We go through all this poor Irish family's trials and tribulations with them,(many of them pure heartbreak) and come out REFRESHED. I think it is the simplicity of the story, and the innocence of this poor family that is so ... FRESH. We experience what the word "poor" truely means.We feel thier loss (the death of a third child) they are still going through, and in short, We fall head over heels in love with this family. We also meet one of thier neighbors that the girls befriend, who is dying,They pull him out of his deep depression at the end of his life, and the family shows him thier love, and offer him lifes greatest gift, thier friendship. Yet we still ache for him, and the smallest child especially when the end comes for him. We do get to experience some joy in his death though, that he got to know the true pure innocent love of this wonderful family before he dies. This movie is a must see, and one of the 10 best I have EVER seen. True, it is a tear jerker, but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more. 
`In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved. The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new. The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah Emma Bolger). Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition. Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect. In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light. That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend. It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states. No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed. As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some. They need each other. The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow. This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness. As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life. This is due mostly to the impressive cast. Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here. I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette. Regardless, her performance was harrowing. She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping. Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season. He was brilliant and deserved some recognition. His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping. And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting. They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow! This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone. It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that. 
In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope. The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs. The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks. Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing. 
Once in a while, movie gem reaches out and touches your soul. I have added this film to my collection of favorites, and those I will savor when I need a gut wrenching cry. I was literally emotionally drained after watching it. The story is set in Hell's Kitchen, among the despair of poverty and addictions. A young Irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life....overshadowed by the loss of their son at five years old. I find myself drawn in the family, deeply sharing their anguish and triumphs. One scene had me on the edge of my seat....at a street fair when the father is trying to win an ET doll for his youngest daughter. I won't tell you the outcome. The youngest daughter, Ariel, has a spirit about her, a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family. She is bold and unafraid, yet she yearns for the love of her father, who is emotionally distant following the death of his son. The oldest daughter, Kristine, is wise beyond her years. She successfully camptures life on her camcorder, which she uses constantly, almost a video diary if you will. The mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart. Her husband has shut her out of his emotionbal life, also, and she struggles to deal with that. She is the glue which binds her family together. Their neighbor, the "screaming man" of the building, is a tormented young artist. The words on his door say it all "KEEP AWAY". I won't give away the plot with his role. A MUST SEE.....I cried, I stopped for a bit, I cried again. I couldn't stop crying. Okay, so I cried at Lion King, too...but that's beside the point. I loaned this movie to my neighbor immediately after, with red puffy eyes. She understands. 
Many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the United States. To this, I respond: We've seen that hundreds of times in films. The same goes for sports films. We've seen the movie Glory Road in other films like Coach Carter, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers. They are exactly the same movie with a different team. That's not to say that these films aren't decent sports flicks, but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genre. That being said, that is exactly what Jim Sheridan does with In America. The story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph. The basic story follows a family of Irish immigrants who come to America with the same notion that all immigrants have: to attain the American Dream. But, as they all sooner or later find out, the American Dream is an ideology that 99.9% of people never attain. They have trouble finding a place to stay, and end up with an apartment at the top of a run down building with many of its residents being junkies. The father Johnny (Paddy Considine) is a struggling actor, who hasn't been able to get a part since the death of his son Frankie, who fell down the stairs. The mother Sarah (Samantha Morton) takes a job at an ice cream parlor to earn the rent money. The oldest daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger) is probably one of the smarter people in the film, and Sarah Bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl. She is the stereotype of the oldest child who is forced to grow up too soon. Her younger sister Ariel (played by Sarah Bolger's younger sister Emma) is the typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions about everything. There are some really touching scenes throughout the course of the film, one especially comes to mind, where the father almost squanders away all of the family's money trying to win an E.T. doll for the youngest daughter. There are essentially three miracles in the film, and Christy, who is also the narrator, relates these three events to a set of three wishes that her brother Frankie told her about before he died. The other great scenes in the film involve the family and their relationship to the man on one of the floors below. When they first arrive in the house, Christy calls him "the man who screams." This man's name is Mateo (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou) and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems. He is sort of the figure of "morality" in the film, often giving out endless amounts of advice. Mateo has some sort of disease (we can only expect that it is probably a venerial disease) and he gets sick throughout the movie. In America features one of the best ensembles I have ever seen. Every actor is perfect in every scene. Djimon Hounsou and Paddy Considine give the best performances in the entire film, and Jim Sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film. While I do agree with one other reviewer about how Christy has a modern camera in a story set in the eighties, stupid facts like these should not detract from the overall message of the film. The overall message, then, is not just about how immigrants face hardships when they come to America; we already know that from previous films and/or experiences. The film has such a deeper message, relating not just to immigrants, but to every person who watches this film. I really do not want to give the message away, but rather I will leave it up to you to go rent or buy this treasure of a film. This is truly one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen 
Human drama and feelings, disregard for stereotypes, great photography, action with reaction and great lesson in self acceptance is but a few of the elements that makes this a great classic. Made me think of my social role and position in life just like Crash did 
In the old days this movie would have been called a "chick flick". Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC. The family consists of a husband and wife with two young daughters who are trying to make it in America as poor Irish emigrants. Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother. One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years 
This is a lovely film; happy and sad. "Do you believe in magic?" Magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love, friendship, perserverance, and the optimism of young hearts. Sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth 
Devil in the flesh was one of the most provocative, challenging and controversial films in those ages. Gerard Philippe was widely known for this fine performance in this love affair between a hard to wait married woman and a sensitive high school, while his husband is in the War. Claude Autant Lara inspired direction and fluid camerawork make of this film one of the obligated referential movies of France along that decade. 
When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think. Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for "enjoyment." That being said, I love this movie, and here's why. 1. It's a true story. 2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the "wrong" country. How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country? This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian. If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time 
IN A NUTSHELL: UNDERRATED - UNDERVALUED - UNDEREXPOSED - Excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event! It is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are ideally suited as Soviet naval Captains, and as believable as their rebuilt authentic K-19! Kathryn Bigelow who Directed and Produced the film did an incredible job, which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the DVD. BOTTOM LINE: THIS NEW KIND OF SUB FILM IS A PART OF HISTORY If you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best. If you enjoy thrillers, this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone. 
This was a true story and a scary part of our history. The book comes to life in the movie... I pictured another person as the captain of the Sub... Mr. Ford did a good job acting the part 
I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice 
There are so much information about this movie in Amazon.com description and other reviews so I don't want to repeat them. The only problem in this movie was Harisson Ford's style, he was acting more American than Russian and for moments you may feel that K-19 is an American submarine and Harisson Ford is an American Captain. He was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts, he couldn't deny his American Friquent Style! I think Harrison Ford for this movie was not a wise Decision. I know, starring First class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie 
K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense. Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men. Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571". The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. "Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given "evil empire" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them? Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, "McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!") The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run. What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur 
Nothing can be better than "The Firm" written by John Grisham, who himself is a lawyer. The attentions to details that Grisham manages to pull are just fantastic. I read the book before watching the movie, and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book, as the book gets slow in between, but not the movie. Cruise's is superb, so are the other actors in this movie. I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences. 
The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie. Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life. At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham. The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into. Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes. Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain 
This is a smartly written and fast-paced drama. Tom Cruise plays a sharp young Harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob. Great supporting help from Gene Hackman and Wilford Brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors. 
The Firm, it`s a great story, and an amazing movie. i`v read the story, and just now, i watched the movie. it`s great to read the story and then watch its movie, you`ll be able to see what you imagined while reading the book! i recomend the firm to all! and if you can get the book and read it first, it`ll be more fun! Trust me! Enjoy 
The DvD is great and so was the price. The movie is EXCELLENT!!! Can't stop watching it! 
I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice. It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out. The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie. Everyone else does a great job of acting here. To me though, Tom is miscasted. He seems to be out of place. His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do. Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned. Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well. A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here 
Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working. Any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film--they may or may not like it, but that's not what matters. This film is amazing 
Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring. It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally. I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me. I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better. My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing. Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
A little Cerebral and a little slapstick, and all Shakespeare. It is how Shakespeare would have written the story of Hamlets friends 
This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something. But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time. There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) writing imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
I have to admit this movie can be slow and strange. Hence minus 1 star. But TO ME, and this is just to ME, I was able to pay attention because of Gary Oldman, who is my all time #1 favorite actor. He's such a chameleon, and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way, shape, or form (or is just eccentric or crazy lol), he's just brilliantly funny in this. It's interesting b/c Gary's character as 'Rosencrantz' (NOT Guildenstern lol) is a 'slow' fella but he's imaginative inventive, but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you're talking about. Then to top it all off, you're thrust into HAMLET, but from another perspective. So you gotta get into the Shakespearian linguo, which I haven't done fully since 12th grade, and that was 6 years ago. Fortunately, Ros Guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or AS THICKLY as the other regular HAMLET characters do. It's just worded strangely b/c it's like they're poets. The chemistry between Roth Oldman is wonderful, and the extra's are interviews with Dreyfus, Oldman, Roth, Stoppard himself. Then they also have a photo gallery. That's it, but for me it was enough to hear Oldman talk for 58 minutes! :) (They're interviewed separately.) The dvd I got came with 2 discs, I suppose this is the only release to DVD so far so they all will be 2 disc? Quality was very good. :) If you're a big fan of Gary's, I HIGHLY recommend this flick. Very amusing, and interesting, and good Shakespearian fun : 
This is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone. This wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare's HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet's melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince. In this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps. It helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style. It helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier. It is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn. It's is fun. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of Shakespeares works. It does help to have an idea of Hamlet, and I would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost. It gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of Hamlet. 
Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
This is one of my son's favorite movies and he lost the VHS tape. This is based on a true story of a military disk jockey in Vietnam. He doesn't follow the rules and has conflict with his disgruntled commanding officer and gets involved with the local people. One of Robyn William's better works 
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin 
An excellent film, Good Morning Vietnam, brings to the screen the story of a US airman that gets transferred from Crete in Greece to Saigon in South Vietnam as the war in S.E. Asia is escalating. It is 1965 and the USA is sending more and more troops to S. Vietnam in an effort to live up to its commitments and treaty obligations (SEATO), and turn the tide against communism. The US Army, worried about the G.I.s' morale, flies in Airman Cronauer from Europe to be a radio deejay and entertain the troops. Things get a bit more complicated when he begins going around the censors by playing Rock and Roll and giving the news as it is... The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both. Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The film does a great job of describing war-ravaged Vietnam as well as people's (including soldiers') every day lives and the problems they face under such conditions. The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the MUSIC are all wonderful! In short, Good Morning Vietnam is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! Recommended along with The Quiet American, starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser. 
Many have tried to dismiss this film as nothing more than a comedic vehicle for Robin Williams. The concept of making light of the horrors of war, particularily Vietnam since it's still so recent in the minds of many turns alot of viewers off to the important potential lessons to be learned in this wonderfully insightful movie. Based on the true life accounts of Air Force officer and D.J. Adrian Cronauer we get a birds' eye view into the strict and ridiculous bureaucracy that can at times reign over military policy and in effect hamper the morale and efforts of the American military. Cronauer provided a much needed spontaneity to the air waves of Vietnam radio and brought however briefly to the American soldiers the contemporary music they wanted to hear. There is alot to laugh at in this film, what else could you expect with the likes of Robin Williams in the lead role. However there is much more going on than what first meets the eye. The concepts of acceptance, friendship, trust and love soon become entangled into the comedic elements which lead to the sad and poignant realization that cultural differences can't always be overcome by good intentions. A bittersweet truth so poignantly conveyed by the beautiful Trinh when rebuffing the romantic advances of Cronauer with the statement, "Vietnam ladies not friends." This film will definitely make you laugh. It will also make you cry and even more importantly make you think. In the final analysis that's what it's all about. There are many wonderful performances in this movie complimenting Robin Williams amazing tour-de-force. My two favorites are Tung Than Tran as 'Phan' and Chintara Sukapatana as 'Trinh.' Highly Recommended! 
Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon. Mitch Markowitz's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other. Director Barry Levinson successfully harnessed the comedian's wild, manic energy in this movie. Of course, the Williams' radio monologues (famously adlibbed by the comedian) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour ("What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery."). Williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in. His best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision (Peter Weir, Terry Gilliam and Gus Van Sant) and this one is no different. Even though Good Morning is essentially a vehicle for Williams, Levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors, like Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh. Along with Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth, Good Morning Vietnam gives a human dimension to the Vietnamese people. Unlike many other Vietnam War movies of the `80s, the Vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities. This incarnation is an improvement over the previous DVD. There is a six part "Production Diary" that runs 34 minutes. This is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed. He sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on (and the film's title). Director Barry Levinson talks about Robin Williams' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script. One part also focuses on the film's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n' roll music and the role it played in the movie. Another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in Thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there. Add to that the extremely hot weather which, incidentally, gave the film a certain amount of authenticity. There are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly, only cast members Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl are back with Williams no where to be found. "Raw Monologues" features 13 minutes of footage from Williams' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes. There is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form, watching how Williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations. Finally, there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers 
i love good morning vietnam because robin williams does an amazing job of balancing humor and drama. this is one of my favorite movies of all time, and i highly reccommend it to everybody. you've got to watch it more than once, because you'll see something new or catch another sly joke each time 
This is one movie experience that you shouldn't miss! Get a dose of Robin Williams' outstanding comic yet brilliant acting for this Barry Levinson film about the era when war torn out Vietnam. I have seen this fil for four times already and I could say that this movie truly capitulates the importance of humor in the middle of tense and severe situation. Yeah, we all know that we shouldn't take this situation as funny but hey, life isn't all about struggle...humor lightens it 
A great movie, loosely based on the Nam tour of the real Adrian Cronauer, as others have said. Adrian is a respected member of the Vietnam Vet community and a number of Vet friends have mentioned his take on the movie - 'If I'd done half of that stuff, Id have ended up in Leavenworth'. The movie is both a Robin Williams vehicle and a look at the first major build-up in the War itself. As for it being a 'police action', the irony was not lost on entertainers like Bob Hope, who often greeted his Nam audiences with "Hello Advisors!" even when there were more than 500,000 troops in Vietnam. In many ways this excellent movie was the first real indication of the caliber of Robin Williams as an actor. He simply shines in this role and it led to a well-deserved Oscar nomination and on to greater things. Highly recommended 
Robin Williams is an AFRS disc jockey in Saigon during the Vietnam War. He is fast-talking, zany, unconventional - and a problem for his superiors. Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty 
"Hello Vietnam,and greetings!",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. "You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. "Would Bob Dylan be out of line?",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,"Way,way,way out of line!". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls." Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,"You suck,eat a bag of s--t!". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,"Good morning,Vietnam",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,"Goodbye,Vietnam" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV? Obviously nobody had any ideas,not even Mitch Markowitz who composed the screenplay 
I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The "graffiti" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again 
This movie is nostalgic for me. It reminds me of an era that I miss greatly. Many people here criticize its accuracy talking about bad grafitti, acting, love songs, etc. What do you guys mean? I am a New York Puertorican, Newyorican raised in Ravenswood Projects, Queens, Bushwick, Brooklyn and went to school in Spanish Harlem. This was back in the day when NYC was tough. La Familia, Ballbuster, Zulu Nation ruled the streets back then. So I guess I got the right to say the movie accurately portrays life in NYC in the 80's. Some guy here criticized the love songs. C'mon man. What, people back then in the projects didn't love anyone?, had a girlfriend, etc? I find the movie to be so real that I definitely want to move back to NYC. I know New York isn't the same. The South Bronx is being renovated. The gangs are gone. All the bombers, Lee jeans creased down the middle and finely pressed and jackets, the pumas and adidas with the thick laces in checkerboard formation, the boricuas with their wild Carribean looks, its ALL gone. But I need to go back, if not to play chinese handball at the schoolyard one more time. I didn't give it 5 stars because there are deleted scenes. Why won't they come out with a DVD including those deleted scenes? I guarantee you everyone that bought this DVD would buy that one also 
Well we know about this movie for more than 20 years that is one of the best. But Amazon has a photo on cover that does not exist 
Honestly beat street is the best breakin video out there period.This like the orgin of hip hop music,dancing and grafitti to this day.The storyline is alright not going to go into details but it send out a positive message to everyone that was there and even today.Honestly just buy the movie why read this review !! 
...This is THE best hip-hop(with break dancing as a main point. Krush Groove is THE best for just the music side) movie ever! REAL rappers, REAL break dancers, both mixed in with actors who probably did not know any rap music at all. It is an authentic dipitcion of the hip-hop world at that time. "Breakin" is a Hollywood Beat Street knockoff, but good in it's own right. I won't go into the story, but I see that they did not put surround sound on this one yet. Another interesting note: I own the original one that came out on DVD some years ago. That cover had Rae Dawn Chong on the cover. I assume because she was the biggest star and at the time they did not think hip-hop would sell. Now as you can see, they make sure that hip-hop is the main focal point for trying to sell it this time around 
As swift as I'd expect to come from the US and is of a fine quality 
I LOVE THIS MOVIE SINCE I WAS A KID. I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT ON AMAZON...I DIDNT EVEN FIND IT ON E-BAY.THE SHIPING WAS VERY FAST. 
Man, I don't see how can anyone say anything negative about this classic movie. Like another guy said earlier, it you have not been there, you should not say anything. I was only 9 years old when "Beat Street" came out. I remember that my mom took me to the freaking theater the first day it came out and she still remembers seeing my silly a*ss at the theater breakdancing to the "Frantic Situation" by Afrika Bambaataa. This movie and breakdancing as a whole has the most special place in my heart because I fell in love with the culture. That's right, breakdancing was about culture, expression, and more than anything MUSIC. I am 31 years old now and I still listen to many of the breakdancing hits from back in the day. One of my favorite bands was "Break Machine". I am getting nostalgic just writing this right now so I'm going :). Anyways, If you want to learn about the roots of Hip Hop, you need to get off your butt and grab a copy of "Beat Street". Breakdancing will always be in my heart!! 
This is clearly the most accurate portrayal of hip-hop which at the time was B-BOY music of which I was a proud member. Anyone who wasn't there at the time can never understand. Nearly thirty years later BBOYS are still playing their music and living the life. Hip hop is the FIRST multi-generational music in American history with Grands, Parents and Kids all listening and understanding the same music my two daughters can spin wax and listen to RUN DMC on their own DId our parents listen to their parents music? Uh... NO. I still remeber leaving this movie and seeing my people on the screen people from my hoods, castlehill the bronx and East New York Brooklyn. The fact that all three BBOY arts were shown closed the deal. Rockers Rappers and DJS all in one movie and I got lucky with my girlfriend that night PRICELESS. Forget any other BS movie this was the one. the only other one was Krushgroove and that was a different era, the beginning of mainstream acceptance, Beat street was the era of renegade music, Dondi, CIA, UPtown Crew(BKLYN), Grand Wizard Theodore, Charlie Chase, etc. 
To those of you who say this movie is wack or is not Hip Hop, you guys have it all backwards. I know for most of you that were born after 1980 this is not part of your generation and it might seem corny to you, but you should understand that the guys in this movie pioneered Hip Hop into what it is today, and should get the respect it deserves. They set the foundation of what you see out there now, and you must also understand that most of your big acts out there today, lack the knowledge of what hip hop was originally about. The MC's back in the day weren't proud to be shot 9 times...u feel me ? If it weren't for Legz and Kool Herc, u wouldn't have 50 cent or Mike Jones. And for all you new inspired rappers out there that put this movie down - dont put it down, learn from the roots and you will be more succesful... 
Sy is a movie producer who is in Cannes for the festival, as usual. However, he needs for someone else to pay all his bills there so takes a bet, that he can turn a young nobody seen on the beach into a credible writer that he can use to raise ...millions while in Cannes. Not a single word has been written but Sy sees that as no impediment to approaching every star in the universe to become involved in his movie, with virtually all of them saying yes, from Johnny Depp to Dennis Hopper to John Malkovich and so on. A hilarious, droll view at the film world that is light as a souffle. It won't stick with you but it is fun for a night 
This Video Blows The Mind.this is a GOlden Time in Soul Music.So Many Great Talents.This is What Soul Music Used To Be About Great Talent&amp;Full Of Fantastic Performances 
Some of the best clips of rock'n'roll performers are to be found on Shindig and this edition, "Shindig! Presents: Soul" is chock full of great perfomances by James Brown, Joe Tex, Booker T &amp; the MGs, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Major Lance, and a see-it-to-believe it duet by Tina Turner and Marvin Gaye. So good, they really need a 2nd edition of this! Actually, a 2nd edition of the whole Shindig! series is a must 
How adorable this film is. John Lithgow is brilliant. I love the scene when he is throwing all the McDonalds hamburgers at the beast. Catch of the day! This movie means something to John. His name is John "Lith", his name is John "Lith." I wonder if Johns little babie son ever acted again hahaha. 
Harry and the Hendersons is such a funny movie; I hope that it comes out on dvd soon. I've rented it several times on VHS in the past, and I never picked up on the negatives that "Mother Hen" mentioned. I guess that I was too busy laughing. I do have one thing to say about "Mother Hen", though. She does have a right to express her opinion about any movie, and if she feels the way that she does about Harry and the Hendersons, then so be it. There are no doubt some others out there that would appreciate her point of view. When my son was little, I may very well have felt the same way, who knows 
complete and un-interrupted by commericals, it was wonderful! I can't wait til it's out on DVD - I'm still holding on to my original VHS recording until I can upgrade 
This is in response to Mother Hen earlier, are you freaking kidding me. A few bad words that your kids already know and have probably uddered about you behind your back is not that big a deal. Why don't you go and buy a ranch down the street from President Bush and picket a couple of bad words in one of the great family movies in the past 20 years. Hey Mother Hen, you layed a giant "who gives a s#$t egg" on this one. 5 star movie, recommend to children of all ages. You'll watch it and laugh and smile with your kids. 
I don't understand why Universal Studios is holding out on releasing this film in the DVD format. Harry and the Hendersons is not the only film that Universal is holding the release date. There are several films, Universal could make a pretty penny releasing on DVD. I guess Universal is just tired of making money, eh 
It's a shame they havent brought this out on DVD yet, its an old pastime thing i remember watching as a kid. Aint seen it in years, and been wanting i 
this is a really great clasic i have found it on dvd. i just cant get enough on this movie i think ive worn out mv dvd player watching this movie 
As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories. The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona. This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's. Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960. The people were wonderful to grow up with. This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer. I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD. I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts. Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating 
This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing. I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it. Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again. I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake. This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long. Hidalgo is the name of the horse. So what? That's about as boring as this movie. So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo. I did not, however, like this movie. It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again. If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
Love this movie, caught some of it on TV one week so then did a search on Amazon and brought the movie. Family entertainment Loosly based on the real life Frank T Hopkins who did more to save the wild Mustang than any other 
Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all. Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the "Ocean of Fire" in the 1890's. This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver. The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a "cowboy'. We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke. And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American. This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins. Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world. When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life. Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity. Viggo must have definitely "lived" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them. He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing. Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series. This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance. Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover. 
Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true. `Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon. If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the "Ocean of Fire". Highly Recommended 
The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses. Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies. Not so with Viggo Mortensen. Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney. Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit. Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office. Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it. All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com. In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse. Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race. Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go. The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created. We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc... It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana! During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit. The movie ends on a triumphal note for both. The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals. The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area! My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie. I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up 
In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character. Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant. What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted. Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider. He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years. After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East. A side note. The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre. The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank. I will discuss these distractions more later in this review. This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins. Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race. Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race. Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts. He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger. Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining. The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo. Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character. Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie. Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie. The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions. I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race. Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were. I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring. Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions. The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly. I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies. He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins. Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest. 
I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days. Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed. This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint. If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it. And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him. He is a very good actor and an underated one at that. So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure. And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!! 
This is a very entertaining movie with the horse stealing the show, of course. I also like that it is based on a real person. 
I showed this at a big party with lots and lots of kids. I was a little worried that the kids wouldn't "get" the old black and white flick, but there wan't a peep, and nobody left or lost interest. Someone else brought and showed "Captain Ron" before I put this on, which made for a great juxtoposition of values. Captain Ron was, typical of modern Hollywood, trashy and profane, while Captains Courageous was positive and uplifting. For my kids, I'd prefer the latter 
Rudyard Kipling's classic boy's tale of the sea is inhabited by Freddy Bartholomew as spoiled rich boy Harvey, Spencer Tracy as compassionate fisherman Manuel, Lionel Barrymore as good-natured Captain Disko, and Melvyn Douglas as Harvey's negligent father. Freddy Bartholomew, who received top billing in this film, is perhaps the best child actor who has ever lived, simply because he really seems to be acting rather than just looking cute. Spencer Tracy, who won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role, is one of the best adult actors of all time. As if that weren't enough, Lionel Barrymore (It's a Wonderful Life) and Melvyn Douglas (Ninotchka, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House) are two of the top character actors. And, to top it off, you've got John Carradine and Mickey Rooney in supporting roles. You can't beat the story or the cast. Victor Flemming (Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind, The Good Earth) did a superb job directing his talented cast and crew through the John Lee Mahin/Marc Connelly/Dale Van Every screenplay, which tells the story of how a spoiled rich boy, out of sorts with himself and the world, falls off a cruise ship into the sea, and is fished out by a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Once on board Manuel's fishing schooner, Harvey learns he won't be able to return to shore for three months, until the fishermen have finished their season of fishing. At first he fights his plight; but through the love and patience of Manuel, Harvey soon learns to fit in and become a contributing member of the crew. He makes mistakes; but Manuel helps him learn and eventually grow into a boy of character. This is a great father-son film. It's also a wonderful film about the sea and sailing. There are some breathtaking shots of ships, especially during a race between two schooners. There are some wonderful relationships. It's interesting to see how each adult deals with Harvey, and how each changes in that relationship as Harvey changes. One of the best scenes of the film, and the one that got to me the most, is at the very end, when Harvey is going home with his dad. First we see the dinghy in which Harvey and Manuel fished being pulled behind his dad's car. Harvey couldn't bear to part with it, so his dad brought it with them. Then the camera pans to the back of the car, where we see Harvey and his dad in the back seat through the window. Harvey is animated with enthusiasm as he is obviously telling his dad about all his adventures - even to the point of exaggerating the size of the first fish he caught. It's a great final statement about the difference an experience like that and a friend like Manuel can make in a boy's life. Waitsel Smit 
i had never seen this movie, and i dont know why! freddie bartholomew (top-billed as a teen!) is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy. over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching. a terrific olio of pathos, comedy, melodrama, and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel (which im embarrassed to admit i never read) one of the best movies ive seen. great supporting work by lionel barrymore, john carradine, mickey rooney, melvyn douglas, more. and freddie is quite the beauty here. a winner! 
Who could ever forget the image of happy-go-lucky Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle, infectious Portuguese accent, "Yo ho little fish don't cry don't cry". If you're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from Spencer Tracy's signature movie, `Captains Courageous' released in '37. Plot: Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), an Ill-mannered rich kid falls overboard off a luxury vessel and finds himself adrift until a passing merchant fishing ship pulls him out of the sea. He is taken under the tutorage of his rescuer, a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Harvey is initially hostile to the thought of having to obey orders and work for his room and board until the ship returns to dock, but eventually comes to understand the important lessons in life being imparted by Manuel. Before his adventure at sea is over he'll learn what it means to be a man. This is without a doubt my favorite Spencer Tracy film and a story the entire family will enjoy. It's beautifully filmed with a tremendous cast which includes along with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew the legendary Lionel Barrymore as Disko and John Carradine as Long Jack 
This is my favorite film of all time! I am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it - It was an Acadamy Award winner, so I don't understand why it's not gotten much attention over the years... I find it superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than Captains Courageous. I don't know why this is the case, but I am it's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it... It is a wonderful and moving story, that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as "It's a Wonderful Life Does"... If you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you! Do not miss it 
I remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people. All of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth: CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. I think it's easy to see why this is the case. The story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore, but the story of young Harvey Cheyne coming of age aboard a Gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance, people can change. On of the reasons the film works so well is the acting. Depression era child star Freddie Bartholomew plays the incorrigible Harvey. Bartholomew plays the role with great skill. He's miserable enough that we're glad when he finally falls overboard, yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued. The transformation is believable and by the films end, we begin to believe in Harvey and even grow to like him. Spencer Tracy won an Oscar as Manuel, the Portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure Harvey has ever known. Today Tracy would never get away with playing a Portuguese fisherman with his Irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent, yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed. Lionel Barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt New England sea captain Disko Troop. Mickey Rooney is somewhat underused as the captain's son Dan. My guess is that if the film were made a few years later when Rooney became a matinee idol, he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded. While a great cast carries the film, there are also smaller details that make the film powerful. The original sea shanties add a certain flavor. The special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time, and the sailing scenes are stupendous. This was no small feat in the 1930's. The film certainly is a timeless classic. People who purchase this DVD will also love the bonus features; trailers of the 1946 re-release, a short film THE LITTLE MAESTRO and a cartoon LITTLE BICK CHEESER. 
The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting. But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance. I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this. He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter. Spencer Tracy's take on a Portugeese accent is to talk in broken english. Like they used to portray the Indian's in the old westerns. It comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english, such as 'Manuel no like you. Wish you not here'. It's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making. And then there's the lack of realism. Half the time there is no one steering the ship. In real life, someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day. On this ship, no one steers at night. When the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie, in the distant shots it's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea's. But when they close in on the actors, the deck isn't moving at all. They just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond. And at the end of the movie, when Spencer Tracy's character is cut in half below the waist. He's not even in pain. He survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head. This is what really spoiled the movie. The only saving grace is Freddie Batrholomew's portrayal of Harvey 
This film is well done and Spencer Tracy shows what a superb actor he was 
Captains Courageous begins with Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), a spoiled rich kid who uses bribes and cheats his way to getting what he wants. When his father (Melvyn Douglas) finds out what his son is up to, he plans a vacation together so that his son can learn how to be a decent human being and so the two can bond. However, Harvey falls off the boat on the way and is salvaged by a Portuguese fisherman named Manuel (Spencer Tracy) who brings him aboard his fishing boat and teaches his how to be a proper man. The film is filled with sentiment, wonderful acting, and good pacing. It never gets boring; there is always something happening even if the set (the fishing boat) is limited. The cast is wonderful. Outside of Bartholomew, Douglas, and Tracy, Lionel Barrymore and Mickey Rooney grace the cast list. The film is slightly dated. There are scenes between Bartholomew and Tracy that pull at one's heart-strings, but sometimes they come off as being too close and slightly creepy, especially in a modern world of child molesters. However, taking in the time period in which the film was made and the sincerity of the actors, these cultural differences can be overlooked 
This film is based on a concept that has potential - a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things - but it doesn't deliver. Clearly, the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us, but he pretty much drops the ball right there. Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well. There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such. Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B with annoying MTV-style jump cuts. In the awards for Obnoxious Splash Films of the Year, this one takes the cake, but not the Pi 
With a reference to Jewish mysticism, this black and white movie perfectly highlights a psychotic world of a talented mathematician attempting to unlock world mysteries "Chaos" (see: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32NUR740CAUFR/ref=cm_cr_auth/104-6854701-1987133?ie=UTF8 ) is much close to resolve. Although mixing a Hasidic community with the Wall Street sharks might usher into unwelcome parallels, I like authors' depiction of New York environment -busy streets,sub,neighbouring- very much. 
Pi is a film that will most likely stay with you long after you watch it. Darren Aronofsky (Requium For A Dream) created an entertaining experimental film with Pi. A very dark movie (aside from being black and white) with a great techno score, and extremley bizzare scenes and images. Pi is a great movie, but I dont think it's so deep and powerful as some reviews stated. There was a few things that went wrong with Pi that I wont go into, but as with most filmmakers making no budget films all their mistakes suddenly become artistic expression. Anyway if you enjoyed Eraserhead or similar films like it then you cant go wrong with Pi 
Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie! It took me more than a dozen views to start figuring out how everything was connected. What's with the bugs? What's that stickey stuff in his mainfraim? How are his breakdowns and paranoia connected to his work, and what is the quite white place he ends up in? All the weird stuff is chaos slipping in between the seams, chaos which he thinks he's fighting against... at first. Max had a thread of a connection to the great infinite divine, that which human beings are not wired to see. He does see it though, glimpses at first, then the whole thing. It almost kills him. It's the classic Iccarus story, except that Max survives and finds happiness at the end. I disagree that the end is a 'cop out' or incongruous-- it is the cumulation of every frame of the film... it is the point! He looks at the leaves blowing in the trees, *doesn't* see a pattern, can't see a pattern, doesn't want to see a pattern-- and, for the very first time, he smiles. Why isn't it perfect? I would have like to see more actual math. The concepts are there, but the details aren't. Not a big deal. "A Beautiful Mind" put a lot of effort into putting real math into the plot, and I like that. Also, some of the details didn't connect. For example, the 'name of god' (216-letters long), and the 216-digit number his computer spits out before dying, wouldn't necessarily be connected. The system they explained indicated that different numbers of integers would represent a single letter in Hebrew. Like 42 would be a letter, and 2 would be different letter. So, the number of digits wouldn't really equal the number of letters... Darren kind of painted himself into a corner there. He wisely chose not to make the punch line of the movie a complex number theory proof, and I didn't even notice (much less become annoyed about) this detail until viewing #15. Up until then, every time I saw it something different would finally make sense. Thus, five stars. I'm inclined to give five stars to any movie that makes me think longer than the credits roll, so this one should get many many more. 
This movie was really on track to be an earth shattering experience for us sci-fi geeks. Here's why: *creeped out techno music. not creepy and etherel in itself...but creeped out in the sense that everything is angled and black and white in contrast to the driving beat. it's incessant, and a great effect. Max's voice-overs add to the overall creepiness. *fantastic concept. brilliant, really. every pattern can be graphed. What if you could graph the pattern of nature and discover a secret "formula" to life? Max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge...not $$$. Great stuff. *tons-o-suspense. the movie really builds up well. almost too well, as my one negative comment will show. you will get a really strong sense that SOMETHING of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching. *tripped out lead character...complete with hallucinations, quirkiness and the obligatory disdain for normal human contact. we're talking visions of brains that shriek and vibrating walls. The lead character is great...if not a little contrived at times by the actor. I mean, he's getting revelations to the meaning of life, the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee! YES! But, i only gave PI 4 stars for a reason: *the letdown. i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it's building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life. I mean, i was right there...hook line and sinker. But i was left on the line at the end. The ending isn't bad...but it seems like a cop-out. Max solves the problem by drilling a hole in his skull. No more special gift...no more math at the speed of thought...no more secret formula or mystery. Dang, i was disapointed. I tried really hard not to be, because the movie had me so enthralled...but I didn't get the "wham-bam" experience i was hoping for at the end. HOWEVER! I would HIGHLY recomend you checking it out for yourself. I've spoken with a lot of folks who totally disagree with me and dig the ending. Great addition to your underground sci-fi. Pick it up! ste 
The main character is a paranoid, out of order, lock in, mathamatician that never stops calculating. But hold on, there's more to the story. This guy is also an envelope pusher. When the movie starts, we realize that his character is not all together there. He has frequent headaches and nightmares. Could be due to his condition: when he was a little boy he stared up into the sun for a dangerous amount of time. the doctors say that his pupils dialated to the size of pin holes. But that's not what the story is about. The story is really about a set of numbers. No one really knows what it is. One says it's random computer junk. Another thinks it's part of a code. One thinks it could help figure out the stock market. A group of people think that it is a code for the actual name of God. The real insanity comes from just knowing that the code exsists. That's what the character goes through. If it is not a numerial code for good . . .could it be a numerial code for evil? Full of intrigue, suspense, and an interest in math. the movie is in full black and white. Really wierd camera angles as well as some messed up scenes. Soundtrack is also weird, like from the twighlight zone. Rent it, if anything else. Enjoy 
I must really commend the guys who put "Pi" together in that the subject matter is quite interesting. There were parts of the story that became obscured in the editing (I suspect) such as the role of the beautiful neighbor (Shekinah?) and it is never clear why our hero's double was standing opposite him on the subway platform with a bloody hand -- at that point, it became more of an self-concious artschool style film instead of focusing upon telling a story. The use of music in the film was almost a complete waste, it just did not work well. The creators needed to incubate this more, IMHO. I enjoyed the film best when it was telling a story, especially without the use of special effects. Still, it is an interesting film to see 
It's all there...drama, action, and suspense. This movie will keep you glued to your seat with all its twists and turns. And Morgan Freeman is a bonus. If a movie has Morgan Freeman in it, then 9 times out of 10 it will be an awesome movie. This is no exception...Great movie. 
Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross...Doesn't get much better than that. Monica Potter ...well, look up cute in the dictionary..Her picture is there. Anyway, this had some serious plot twists that somehow all seemed to make sense as they got tied together. Morgan Freeman continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors in film today. 
I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross. Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike. Not even close. Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel. Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of "Dallas". As with most books made into movies, something is missing. I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book. All that said, I did enjoy the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained 
I could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that I'm smarter than you but that's pretty much a waste of my time and yours. I like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches, to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it's comprised of. The story line has interesting twists, it has actors in it I like. So I give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because I get to watch Morgan Freeman act and Monica Potter be cute as hell (I just REALLY REALLY wish she could act but cute will do). Not a bad way to spend an hour or two 
By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider 
This was a great movie. Kept me in suspense. Buy it. 
This film is really only good for two things. 1. Chris O'Donnell appears without his shirt on for one scene 2. Faye Dunaway plays a crazy drunk (ultimate camp! 
Apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime, the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment. It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson. There was a new hope in that man. But that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit Paris Dauphine, Universit Paris I Panthon Sorbonne 
Gene Hackman's electrifying performance dominates this adaptation of John Grisham's best selling novel. Hackman portrays Sam Cayhall, a man who's been on death row for sixteen years for the bombing of a lawyer's office that resulted in the death of the lawyer's two children. Cayhall is a vile man, who has lived a life of hatred and prejudice, the result of generations of such bigoted ancestors. Enter Chris O'Donnell as his young grandson, who is a lawyer and wants to reopen the case and spare his grandfather the gas chamber. What ensues is a painful exploration of hatred, prejudice and a dysfunctional family. I liked the movie, in spite of its several flaws. Hackman is phenomenal, and Chris O'Donnell does a good job as the naively innocent, but determined, young barrister. Faye Dunaway offers wonderful support as Hackman's estranged daughter who has lived a life of secrecy and guilt. Lela Rochon, Raymond Barry, David Marshall Grant and Robert Prosky offer fine support too. I found myself involved in the movie, and feel it didn't offer any easy answers. Hackman is a guilty man, but his performance is so well doone that one can't help but feel sorry for the life he has chosen, and the life he has sacrificed. I think it's well worth viewing 
"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films I've ever seen. I only saw this once and that was awhile ago, but I do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been. Richard Gere (yeah, I know) plays a Washington Post reporter named John Klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident. After the accident which is purposely filmed so that we don't know how or why it really happened, his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth. She keeps asking Klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not, a kind of Dracula-like figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable. At first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures, the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on. Will Patton has to be the best actor in this movie. He plays Gordon Smallwood, outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses. When Klein shows up at Gordon's house (and has a rifle shoved in his face), it is not by accident. Nothing in this movie really is. The way Pellington shoots the scenes of Gordon losing his mind is unforgettable--it happens in a fizzy, weird video game type way which comes off very vividly. I've never liked Laura Linney too much and have always felt she belongs on TV but she does a decent job as Connie Mills, the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for Klein's breakdowns as the REAL star of the movie--Indrid Cold--keeps calling him. Only in "The Exorcist" or "Black Christmas", perhaps, have I seen a movie before in which a creepy, otherworldly voice becomes the star. Even when Klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone, it keeps ringing and ringing. This is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope. The climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless. Bottom line: every horror fan should see this.  
I just read Dirk's "spolier" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh? Demonic, fallen angles? What? Did we watch the same movie? If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear. Unfortunately, the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely, and so the happenings at Point Pleasant lost their entire frame of reference. If you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened, you might come to the conclusion of the Mothman being evil, demonic, fallen angles, whatever you like. But if you research the incident at all, you'll see you're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie. And if, like Dirk, you thereby think you know all about what Mothman actually was based on just the movie alone, then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a Hollywood writer's imagination and script and nothing more. Mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be. Don't judge by the movie, read the book 
I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged. 
The Mothman Prophecies is a throwback to the time when "horror movie" didn't actually mean "Teenage Gore Fest." I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does. Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurances; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life. The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares. And only a PG-13 rating. Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated "tricks" like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much. The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime. If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length. Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months. Get it while you can. * * * * * * * * * * Rating: Solid A + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + F.Y.I.: Although this film is rated only PG-13, it may be too scary or intense for children 15 and under 
"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of those rare films where everything magically 'works' resulting in a magnificent piece of cinematic art. Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post who is trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife. He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. They soon learn that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie moth-like entity, similar to the one Klein's wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this "mothman" is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late? "The Mothman Prophecies" is not a monster movie, nor is it a mad-slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinimatography, locations, etc. Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is touching in a very powerful way. I'll put it this way, if you appreciated "The Village," you'll love this one. The notable Amazon reviewer Lawrence Bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it about four or five times to finally discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have "ears to hear" and be willing to work for them. My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the "mothman" brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the "mothmen" are good in nature. I've come to see that this translation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring. [SPOILER ALERT -- Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen] The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)? The bible calls Satan the "prince of the power of the air," hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of "angels" and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones. The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders. The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millenia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. The saved police woman, number "37" (research that number), in the end is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive. The film powerfully reveals that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the movie ever reveals this). For more intriguing insights see Sam Damon Jr.'s outstanding review from October 27, 2002. [END SPOILER ALERT] "Mothman" ranks up there with my all-time favorite movies. 
This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE. 
Three problems with this film: 1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary. It's very boring. As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed. 2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging. The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes. Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole. The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting. 3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question. The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?" In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake. Don't waste your life. ALon 
I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed. I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident. The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller. The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based. Very interesting in its own right 
This movie had a halfway decent set up and good acting, but the storyline deteriorated as the secrets were revealed and the ending made no sense. That's 91 minutes of my life that I will never get back, honestly my time would have been better spent sitting in an empty room staring off into space, at least then I could pass it off as meditating. 
I found this movie to be great and with a cast of some of the best actors. Julienne Moore, Gary Sinise, Dominic West, Alfre Woodard, Linus Roach, and Anthony Edwards. I enjoyed the storyline a lot, thought it was an interesting idea and it is definitely worth a rewatch if you've already seen it 
I found this movie unpredictable, even after reading the plot on the back of the box. The acting is good and believable. Some of the scenes are designed to "shock"; The execution of these scenes are frighteningly effective. I watched this on a 13" low resolution screen with a pair of small multimedia speakers on low volume, but the scene at about 39 minutes nearly stopped my heart. If I had seen this in a theater, I may not be here to tell you about it. Seriously... if you even think you may have a heart condition, you would be well advised to have a loved-one screen this movie for you first. My only criticism, as mentioned by another reviewer, is not enough information about "Them" and their motivations to wrap my imagination around. Most young people can safely watch this movie with minimal parental input, assuming they are old enough to know that the boogie-man doesn't really exist. Refreshingly, there is no sex, although the main actor and actress who are barely acquainted, do spend 2 nights together, one in separate rooms, and one in the same bed and fully clothed 
The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits. Anyways The Forgotten is a movie you should see once and that's it, happy viewing 
I rented this movie expecting the worst. This movie is suprisingly good. I love the storyline and the ending. Definately recommended 
In Adaptation, Robert McKee tells Nicolas Cage's character that the reason he can't write a successful script based on Meryl Streep's character's story, is because she is lying, and a story where the characters don't act truthfully can't work. But Capturing the Friedmans is successful despite the fact that the boys clearly are lying about something. In fact, people can't stop thinking about this film. Jarecki cleverly shows that as characters who lie, the Friedmans act very logically as they assume textbook roles of the codependent family model. Clearly, the charges they went to prison for were ridiculous and even improbable, but something was up. The father certainly went to great lengths to be a family community Hero (to hide his Addiction -- he played 2 roles) while the mother Enabled -- I won't say what -- by allowing the three boys and the dad to have a pact, a private club, from which she was excluded. After all, she knew her family wasn't right but she didn't go into his office or question the boys, allowing a strong secret to be kept from her in her own home. So the parents covered three roles - the Addicted, Enabler, and Hero. Next we have David, the Mascot, who immediately puts underwear on his head BEFORE he even knew why they were at the house, to distract the media's attention from his father. In the codependent model, a Mascot "clowns" around in order to distract attention away from the Addicted member. [He got so good at it, he's now a professional] A Mascot is either happy or sad according to whatever will get the most attention. David put the underwear on his head to distract the media--YES, I SAID UNDERWEAR (they be some karazy folks in this family)--and when that didn't work, he went to great lenghts to organize a campaign to prove his father was innocent. When the mother finally got it together and realized the father was a rat, he got vicious in redirecting the accusations toward her - again, any behavior that will distract attention from the Addicted/Dependent member. But his act is thin, because it turns out the father hid the child porn magazines where the boys would find them, but not her -- in his office and among the music in the piano bench. Being the main pianist among the boys, David must've looked through the music in the piano bench. So why did he defend his father and play dumb? Jesse, the Scapegoat, took the negative attention by association and like a true Scapegoat, seems proud of it - winking at the camera when he says he will go to court and "abandon father." Also, in the car on the way to the sentencing, when David confronts him, asking if any of it happened during the computer classes, Jesse says no - but then his eyes change as he says nothing that he saw, anyway. Seth, who declined to be a part of the film, seems to be the Lost Child (although I can't say for sure). That's all the characters in the codependent family model. Wow. Looks textbook to me. So, Friedmans, out with it - I don't want to say what I think you're lying about. Why don't you 
An utterly fascinating look at the crash and burn of an American family. The father, Arnie Friedman, was witness to his mother's inappropriate and self-serving sexual activity; unsurprisingly, he turns out to be a pedophile whose penchant for buying kiddie mags gets him investigaged for child rape. His wife, Elaine, who looks like the years with Arnie has sucked the life out of her, walks around in a fog, totally bewildered that a)she married such a creepy little freak and b)her three boys prefers dad to her. Oldest son Dave is in his own state of denial about his father's problems and blames it all on mom. The most sympathetic figure is youngest boy Jesse, who was imprisoned for 13 years for a most unsympathetic crime. Did Arnie and Jesse rape those little boys? The interviewed accuser comes across as less than credible - he contradicts himself, can't remember the first episode of molestation (though remembers plenty else) and when asked to explain an important detail, hesitates as though he were thinking "what the heck do I say now?" The Feds appear to have been caught up in the same hysteria that got a bunch of innocent day care providers tossed in prison in the 1980s - they used interview techniques that were more like criminal interrogations and hypnosis (reknown for inducing false memories.) Way to manipulate and damage little kids, you dumb cops. In any case, Arnie is a self-admitted pedophile and his taste for child porn victimizes his whole family, especially Jesse (possibly in more ways than one.) Despite this, his boys absolutely adore him. It's hard to understand why - on their home movies, dad comes across as an emotional dud, with a flat affect and a distant stare. The most animated he gets is when he pounds out "I'm In Heaven" on the piano the night before he goes to prison. The oldest son David is especially an apologist for Arnie. He implies that if Elaine had not been such a cold fish Arnie wouldn't have been in the predicament he ended up in. You just want to slap Dave around with the facts of life: "David! Wake up! Your parents didn't have sex because DADDY likes LITTLE BOYS!" Watch this movie. At the very least, it'll make you feel better about your own screwed up family.  
watching this film, at times, was extremely difficult for me. althogh I wasn't really a close friend of jesse's in highschool, I did see him every day and shared mutual friends with him, including some of the non-related accused. the alleged incidents were shocking to say the least and rocked the quiet, sheltered lives of most of the population of Great Neck. I taped "Capturing the Friedmans" from cable and actually had to watch it in two seperate viewings, with about two weeks in between (spent on re-focusing my thoughts). Andrew Jarecki did an outstanding job of connecting the Friedman family to the viewers so you almost feel like you were there with them, participating in the making of all the home movie footage. I happen to like documentery style films very much and this is by far one of the most moving and at the same time most disturbing ones I have ever seen. I would highly reccomend seeing this film to anyone who appreciates a well made documentery, or to anyone who can handle an extremely heavy hitting true story. to add to the experience of this film you can find out a lot more information on Jesse's web site.(just enter his name in any search engine to get the exact address) 
There's not enough good I can say about this film. It is fascinating on so many levels. Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki's original idea -- to film New York City birthday clowns -- took a new tack when he met #1 clown David Friedman, who had a family secret infinitely more intriguing than his birthday work. It turns out that David's father was an infamous Long Island pedophile whose story had rocked the small town of Great Neck in the late 1980s. The film is a chronicle of the Friedman's story, from the days before the scandal until the present. Father Arnold Friedman is a beloved high school teacher who teaches piano and computer skills at his home. After police catch him with a few kiddie porn magazines, they start interviewing Friedman's students. Suddenly, Friedman and his teenage son Jesse are being charged with hundreds of incidents of sodomy and assault, and their lives are turned upside down. Luckily (from the point of view of the filmmakers) the family had always loved taking films of themselves and did not stop during the family crisis. Much of the family's film and video footage appears in the movie, either reinforcing or acting as counterpoint to the interviews they accompany. But "Capturing the Friedmans" is about much more than a pedophilia scandal. It is also about the way that the structure of the justice system -- police, lawyers, judges and legal procedures -- can sometimes generate convictions from nothing. The film is also about memory, specifically the way our memories are reshaped by the passing years. Research is now demonstrating that memories -- rather than being videotapes of the past -- are strongly colored by the way we see ourselves in the present. In the film, the juxtaposition of present day "recollections" with the written and filmed record is staggering. The filmmakers are not trying to exonerate the Friedmans or to indict those who brought them to justice. The facts are laid out with all their gaps and contradictions; the characters are allowed to tell their own stories with all their factual and self-serving facets. And we are asked to respond. Are the Friedmans victims, merely odd or truly evil? How did a community come to believe what seems to be a bizarre story? How did the legal system reach a verdict without adequate investigation by skeptical police or a trial before the peers of the accused? Was justice served -- or merely the justice system? The 2-disk DVD includes Jarecki's interview on the Charlie Rose Show as well as interesting material taken during Q sessions at the film's premiers. The film's participants react to the way they are depicted -- usually continuing to make the case for decisions made 15 years in the past -- sometimes escalating into confrontations and raw anger. In short, "Capturing the Friedmans" is a movie that I cannot stop talking about and recommending to everyone I meet 
Hands down one of the best documentaries ever made. As you can see from the variety of reactions here, it is a film that engages the audience despite its incredibly controversial nature. I'm amazed at how split the responses are with regards to the guilt of Arnold and Jessie Friedman (specifically the crimes they were accused of together), and even more surprised by the sympathy expressed towards the mother, Elaine. Regardless of whether her husband and son were actually guilty (and for the record, the accusations are HIGHLY implausible and the evidence non-existent), her behavior was selfish and atrocious. I'm sure she was experiencing her own turmoil and thought she was doing the right thing, but it is astounding to see a woman with such a poor sense of familial commitment claim righteousness over the others. Especially considering her choices in starting this family. In fact, it is this destruction of the family dynamic that makes the piece so compelling. Seeing it disolve firsthand, via the home videos made by the Friedmans, is absolutely fascinating. Provided you can stomach the graphic and frank discussion about pedophilia, this documentary is fantastic 
Because there is no evidence to prove either way. The fact that 2 long prison sentences were still the result of all this is shocking. If I were innocent of a crime I did not commit (especially one as horrible as this), I would NEVER give in and plead guilty just to bargain with the judge. I have no respect for Jesse Friedman in this regard. Let me make it clearer. Andrew Jarecki was just making a documentary about New York Clowns when he met David Friedman, the best party clown in New York. David told him of his past and provided Jarecki with hundreds of reels of family home-movie footage. The Friedmans captured every moment of their lives on film it would seem. The story that unfolded in these films was something Jarecki could never even dream of. Arnold Friedman was a troubled man. After the death of his 9-year-old big sister his father left and the family was torn apart. His mother moved into a tiny apartment with him and his brother and all three of them shared a room. The mother would bring back male partners and shag them in full view/earshot of her sons. Wouldn't that disturb you? But it gets even worse. He was a merry man, slightly camp and married a woman who was as about as sexually responsive to him as a blow-up doll. They may have had three sons and lived a 'happy' existence as an upper-middle class Jewish family in a well-to-do part of the state, but underneath it all Arnold was hiding a secret. He was a huge paedophile and he liked really young boys. He would order kiddie fiddling mags from Europe, but one of them was seized by customs and he was investigated. Arnold also taught computer class and the cops made a list of all the names of the kids he taught and made a point of interviewing them with some truly dodgy, unclear, unprofessional techniques. Many of the kids said that Arnold and his oldest son Jesse had been sexually abusing them. And not a simple one-at-a-time deal either. Apparently they had made them all strip naked in class and play a horrible game called 'leap frog' in which each and everyone of them would quickly and systematically be anally raped. Is this disgusting? Of course it is? Do I believe it? No! There is no way that this could have continued for as long as it did without someone noticing. Other kids in the same class said nothing like it ever occurred. And if it did then where is the evidence? Without meaning to sound crude, anal sex is a pretty difficult thing to get right as an adult. For terrified, unwilling children who are being mass-raped where was the tissue damage, the blood, the tears, the agony and the reluctance to ever go back to Mr Friedman's class? Even for adults it's not simply like sticking a hot dog through a donut. This whole allegation that they did anal-rape as a game of leap frog is absurd and totally far-fetched. Did Arnold Friedman have wicked thoughts about his students? Probably. Did he involve his then 18-year-old son? Hmmm, I'm not sure about that one. Let me just say that the Friedman household is one I am glad I am not part of. There always seems to be an atmosphere of unnaturalness or 'something ain't quite right here' about it. Jesse Friedman says that his dad never hurt him. Jesse Friedman's Defence Attoney says otherwise. This is a particular trick Jarecki uses to show the conflicting sides of the story. One person says black and immediately another person says white. The documentary is nothing but contradicting stories and polar opposites. While I do not believe the entire innocence of Arnold Friedman (the man clearly WAS a paedophile), I do NOT believe the word of the Cops, the FBI or any other authority interviewed. The Judge, one Abbey Boklan, said she was sure of Arnold Friedman's guilt the second she saw him. In my view, she's openly admitting to Gross Professional Misconuct. How dare she, a judge, a stern, responsible authority figure, make such an outrageous, unfounded remark without hearing ANY kind of evidence first. And like I said, there IS no evidence. Only the claims of the children. Nothing in this case was based on evidence because evidence didn't exist. Doesn't that strike you as being really, really odd? The Cops claimed that hypnosis was used to get answers out of the kids. As well as pressure from the parents (oblivious to the fact that their kids are undamaged physically) to tell the proverbial awful truth and encouraging embellishment of perhaps slight truths and instances to the point where this whole ridiculous leap frog game is created. The trial is not the only focus of the film. The complete and utter breakdown of the family is also caught on camera. The sons hate their mother with a passion at her refusal to stand by her man. I can understand their anger, but what woman would? She had no evidence to persuade her either way, but she always found an unnaturalness to Arnold and the allegations probably confirmed her fears I guess. Arnold killed himself in prison in 1995 so Jesse, also imprisoned for 13 years despite no evidence, could benefit from the $250, 000 insurance policy. Mrs Friedman re-married but the family name is stained forever in my opinion. So too should be the word of all the unprofessional authorities and lawyers involved. No one in this documentary comes away without tarnish. It's a sick, sad and sorry story that will confuse as much as it enlightens. Make up your own mind 
One of the best documentaries I have ever experienced. I use the word "experienced" on purpose, as the movie goes beyond being mere "entertainment", it forces the viewer to become so involved in the story (or case) that you become a thinking, analyzing participant. Andrew Jarecki made an achingly beautiful film, and his care and commitment to present the most unbiased version of events is evident. The dvd comes with an extra disc, containing lots of additional footage, facts, information and updates. After watching all of it, accessing the DVD-ROM content AND after listening to the commentary track by Jarecki, you will hit the internet in search of even more information of this compelling case. That is the truth. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
Andrew Jarecki intended to make a documentary on David Friedman, "New York's Number One Birthday Clown." What Jarecki uncovered, however, was the sad, secret, mysterious tale of David's father and youngest brother. To their friends and neighbors in Great Neck, an affluent New York suburb, the Friedmans were a model family-until one Thanksgiving Day when Arnold Friedman, a former musician and award-winning teacher, and his youngest son, Jesse, were accused of child molestation. The resulting investigation and trial exposed a bizarre criminal case where the facts were neither as simple nor as clear-cut as they initially seemed. The Friedmans compulsively filmed and videotaped themselves during happy times, and, strangely, this practice wasn't curtailed after the arrests. Much of CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS consists of this family footage, and while you have to question their rationale behind shooting these intimate moments, there's no denying that they're what give this documentary its emotional power. What is the nature of truth? CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS will make you ponder that question long after you've seen it. A bizarre, disturbing, and compelling experience 
I'll be as upfront as this documentary filmmaker was in his story telling: I'm a survivor of eleven years of sexual abuse at the hands of my father. My 3 siblings also were abused as were other children. How do I know? Besides them telling me, I often witnessed the incidents. Not all serio-peodophiles are the stuff of witch-hunt hysteria, but trust me they'd sure like you to believe that was the case. I state that now because the filmmaker gives the audience the most important information first as well: this father Friedman, he loved his child porn. You don't need to be Sherlock to figure out what comes next. Or maybe you do. I didn't because being up close and personal with a molester for the first 15 years of my life, I have a radar for such things. I had heard about this supposedly controversial movie for a while now but did not seek it out. I just happened tonight to come upon it on a specialty movie channel here in Canada. I think this documentary is a movie first, documentary second using real life persons - some of whom can act better then others. Hmm. Art imitating life? And what a window it is into the life of one peodophile's family. As soon as we discover father Friedman has ordered one child porn mag, you have to be pretty nave to believe it was his first. And yes, we soon learn he had a stack of kiddie mags. Then, as you discover this award-winning teacher gets excited about little boys, who couldn't put two and two together and think he just might be a risk to his students and had been to his 3 sons? Oh, we do learn he only did "one kid." Then it's two. But they weren't his students. Earlier it was only one mag and no children. Oh really? One or two -- they were somebody's children! What parent wouldn't have alarm bells go off when they discover their teacher is REALLY into their kids? The hysteria that ensues I would think would be less criminal than the fact that this teacher has kiddie porn, has molested and might molest one or more of these students. Watching this film is like watching a window into an episode of my family soap-opera. The mother is cast as the villain; the father is the talented victim/"peodophile, yes, but he didn't do his students!"; the three sons are the entertaining drama-making by-standers. In my family there were also 3 sons, but with a sister. Our mother was nave, yet devoted; our father, unlike father Friedman was not lovable or quiet, but was when it came to anything to do with our abuse. Over 30 people found out about our abuse and his silent admission had him sail through unscathed until I finally went to a detective in 1981 when I was 20!! [our family story can be found in Father's Touch here on Amazon.com] Capturing The Friedmans is a horror movie. The quiet father who loved kiddie porn and molested by his own admittance at the very least two kids is completely responsible for the travesty that befalls his family and community. The "evidence" as portrayed in the film leads the viewer to believe that witch-hunt hysteria of the community destroyed one peodophile's family. While it is a travesty that anyone (investigators and or/parents) would mislead children to wrongly testify, a devil's advocate could suggest that the community's reaction opened pandora's box. Did the community have the right to know their student's teacher loved child pornography and had a sexual interest in children? Again, what amazes me is that people can state, "only two kids". The "one" neighbourhood boy my father molested in my presence "only one time", I happened to report to police a decade after the incident. I met this brave now man who supported us, years after the incident, at the preliminary hearing. It took all his strength to come forward, be at the court house, be in the presence of his one-time molester. He looked like the raped young soul of a decade earlier. No, there is no such a thing as just one incident, one victim. Once is too much! Capturing The Friedmans suggests that a village destroyed one boy in particular [the youngest son was co-accused with the Father of molesting several students, and in a plea-bargain to avoid possible life-time incarceration, admitted his father had molested him]. This is one case where the sins of the father fell on the son and if this film leaves a viewer with the notion that anyone or anything was the primary destroyer other that the peodophile father, then I'd re-catergorize it as fantasy - documentary 
One of the classic Disney movies I remembered was the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Reading this novel gave me the same feelings I had in my childhood years watching the movie. I could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie. Alice was reading her sister's book and fell asleep under a tree. Then she woke up, saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking. She then followed the rabbit into this hole. After that she was in a never ending tunnel, which lead her to a strange world. Alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them. I thought the book was just like the movie. I guess was I was reading the novel made me have a better understanding. I was mainly looking for any symbolism of some sort, but failed to do so. I was also shocked at what the things characters were doing in the book and made it into a Disney movie. For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book. I thought the novel would have a different story than the movie. From a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 7. Just because it was interesting and reminded me of the past. 
In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll a young girl with the name of Alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her. The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister. She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it. Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of. This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of. Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride. I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting. I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way. This book is for children and adults alike. As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world. 
When I was eight years old, this version of Alice in Wonderland was aired on T.V. I thought I had watched the best movie ever at that time, and still, to this day, I have more fond memories of watching that movie than any other time in my life! The songs were beautiful! I can still sing the song Alice sang to the deer - "Why do people act as if they're crazy? Why to they behave the way they do? I have to say, this is one my favorite songs of all time! If you get a chance to purchase and watch this movie, you will witness the beautiful music 
I LOVED THIS AS A CHILD. IT USED TO BE ON TV A LOT AND I REMEMBER BEGGING MY MOTHER TO TAPE IT ON VHS. WE RECORDED IT ONE DAY AND I WATCHED IT SO MUCH THE VHS BROKE. I AM NOW 20 AND MY BOYFRIEND RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS DVD PLUS THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS FROM SOME IDIOT ON HERE AND HIS COPIES WERE WORSE THAN MINE. HE CLAIMED THEY WERE NEW BUT WE GOT THEM AND THEY WERE OPENED MASS PRODUCED COPIES. WE COULD TELL BECAUSE THE VHS'S WERE BLANK AND THE COVERS WERE NOT ORIGINAL. PLEASE RELEASE THESE MOVIES ON DVD! 
I was just 2 years old when this movie came out, but my grandfather taped it for me on Beta.. When I was about 3 I started watching the Beta tape.. Let's just say I drove my family CRAZY with this movie! I watched it in its entirety EVERY day.. I memorized every single line. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone!! I now have it on VHS, but am praying one day it will go to DVD because when I have kids some day I would like them to be able to enjoy this movie. It's a fun family movie. It has an all-star cast and is very enjoyable!! I definitely think you all should watch it 
I first viewed this version when it came out in 1985. I was enthralled by it then and still love it today (I have a well-worn VHS copy from the tv.) It brings the story to life in a way that no other attempts have achieved. A few friends and I have been searching for this version for ages and are thrilled to have finally found it. It's strange, but I would almost place this particular "Alice" into the cult classic category. Children and adults alike will completely fall in love with this classic, I'm sure 
This is an abridged version of Alice in Wonderland. The story does not suffer, since much of the omitted material is not essential. The quality of the reading by Fiona Shaw is flawless. The numerous sound effects are well done and contribute to enjoying the story. 
I agree with the reviews already posted. This is the only Alice in Wonderland movie in my opinion. As children my sister and I would watch it all the time from a video taped from the television. Years later I saw it in a video store and had to buy it even though it wasn't on DVD. I still have my copies but am waiting patiently for them to be released on DVD 
This production of Alice in Wonderland is pretty fabulous. I loved it as a child. It has a lovely mix of classic stars (Sammy Davis Junior, Imogene Coca) and flavors-of-the-month from the mid-80s (Pat Morita, John Stamos). It would make a great DVD set 
Back in the 80's when I was about 7 or 8 years old, this 2 part movie came on TV and we recorded it, of course it was on Beta back then. I totally fell in love with this movie. After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it. So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away. They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much. To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it. I have watched many other versions of Alice In Wonderland and no other version has had an Alice as good as Natalie Gregory or a white rabbit as good as Red Buttons. Even Ringo Starr is in this version. I totally love that rabbit costume and back in the 80's, you can tell, or at least I can tell how much work the director put into this film. Since 1985, other versions haven't shown as much detail and work like this version has. Even the roses in the rose garden looks real. I do hope one day, they will release this 2 part masterpiece on DVD because my tapes have gotten a lot of use in the last 5 or 6 years. If you own any Alice In Wonderland, own this 2 part one because this one puts every other version to shame!! 
If the world weren't what it is today, I wouldn't have believed that this movie describes a scenario that could happen. But at a time when everything that it means to be American has been tossed in the trash can in the name of the "war on terror," this movie is much more plausible now than when it was made 
Loved this movie...this is a perfect movie for what's going on in America right now 
Im suprised somebody at New Line Cinema didnt get Iced for making this film. Too Too Real !!!!!. I guess the elite know the masses wont even watch it. 
After viewing Wag the Dog I can say that I did in fact enjoy watching it, but I'm not wholly sure why. Well lets start with a few problems I had with it to give my head a chance to think it over one more time. My main beef with this film is that at some times the plot drags along a little too slow, without hardly anything happening, or much keeping you distracted until a plot twist came into effect. I also have to say that I thought their choice for background music quite odd for what the movie was based on; the music used although hardly used, makes the whole thing seem light-hearted or like a fairly tale which for this movie is bad because the whole idea of it is to make he viewer question what the media tells you. And music like that just makes it a little harder to believe. Anyway, I really liked the idea of not even including the president as a character in the movie. He was just heard from the other end of the phone saying dumb things like "That cat should defiantly be white." or "It sounds too corny." That adds to the main reason I enjoyed this movie; Its unconventional yet still effective. It doesn't really fit into one given genre, so I have to slap the broad Drama/Comedy label onto it. Which makes it difficult to compare to other movies of the aforementioned genres. What I mean by that is that I couldn't recommend this to a fan of Comedy or drama, because it ends up being a mix of both, so if you a genre buff you probably won't enjoy wag the dog. But people with an open mind will, however, be able to see past the need of having a genre plastered on everything and enjoy this movie for what it is. The acting is as expected from just a star-studded cast that includes such big names as Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Leary and Willie Nelson. I don't know how much better you could expect the acting in a movie to be. Of course its really Hoffman and Di Niro who shine in this movie; they work well off each other making you forget who they are in real life and think of them as Stanley Motss and Conrad Brean. All in all I would recommend Wag the dog to anyone who enjoys movies, Comedies, Satires, and/or people who just enjoy a new idea or plot. Take it from Someone who has only ever really enjoyed a handful of movies in their life; you should see this movie 
For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
Dustin Hoffman presents a master role in the game of creating scenarios so realistic that the entire world becomes his work area. So thorough is his work that the fiction becomes the reality and one cannot but watch the satire becomes the real life and the studio director becomes the world director; a condition that cannot be tolerated and leads to his end. Are we living in that world? Can we now define reality? Who controls our thoughts? This gives room to deep thoughts. Dustin Hoffman is indeed the best person to portray this message 
"Wag the Dog" is a scathing parody of how politicians manipulate the media to mold public opinion and sentiment. Briefly, the President (think: Clinton)is accused of molesting a "Firefly" girl (think: Monica) and his main "behind the scenes" political operative (think:Karl Rove) hires a Hollywood producer to create a war with Albania to distract the public. It's hard to believe that this film was made in 1997, before the Clinton impeachment, and even harder to believe that the film was made long before the Iraq war. Remember the famous "hostilities are over" media event when Bush landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier? When was that? Three years ago? It's hard to beat this star-studded cast: deNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Harrelson, Kirsten Dunst (in a bit role), and a hysterically funny Willie Nelson. This is a film that has gotten even more relevant and pointed since its release--a rare thing. I would give this a 4 1/2 if I could because the plot line drags a bit at times--but I howled with laughter at the "production" numbers and the Willie Nelson songs. Highly recommended 
Man! this movie is soooooo boring. I literally slept through this movie. If I die not having watched it again ill be happy. i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs. old, but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr 
This is the perfect guide to understanding how every democratic government works. It makes you think of past and present political events. It is a must have movie and a great tool to teach your children about the political world they live in. The acting, ect. is great. In this same category I also recomend "Being There" with actor Peter Sellers. 
This 90-minute satire on politics in the age of mass media zips along for 75 minutes at a breakneck pace, sharp and witty and full of great performances, especially Hoffman as a film producer underappreciated by everyone but himself and Willie Nelson as a slightly muddled country singer. The commentary on war as an Administration tool for distraction has become even more meaningful since the film was made in '97. Though it gets a little off the rails in the last 15 minutes, "Wag the Dog" is great fun, and it's starting to look like it'll be Levinson's last great film. My favorite lines -- Hoffman: Anybody know anyone who's ever eaten in an Albanian restaurant? DeNiro: Is there such a thing as an Albanian restaurant? Hoffman: Has to be. They have to eat, right 
Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working. Any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film--they may or may not like it, but that's not what matters. This film is amazing 
A little Cerebral and a little slapstick, and all Shakespeare. It is how Shakespeare would have written the story of Hamlets friends 
This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something. But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time. There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) writing imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
I have to admit this movie can be slow and strange. Hence minus 1 star. But TO ME, and this is just to ME, I was able to pay attention because of Gary Oldman, who is my all time #1 favorite actor. He's such a chameleon, and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way, shape, or form (or is just eccentric or crazy lol), he's just brilliantly funny in this. It's interesting b/c Gary's character as 'Rosencrantz' (NOT Guildenstern lol) is a 'slow' fella but he's imaginative inventive, but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you're talking about. Then to top it all off, you're thrust into HAMLET, but from another perspective. So you gotta get into the Shakespearian linguo, which I haven't done fully since 12th grade, and that was 6 years ago. Fortunately, Ros Guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or AS THICKLY as the other regular HAMLET characters do. It's just worded strangely b/c it's like they're poets. The chemistry between Roth Oldman is wonderful, and the extra's are interviews with Dreyfus, Oldman, Roth, Stoppard himself. Then they also have a photo gallery. That's it, but for me it was enough to hear Oldman talk for 58 minutes! :) (They're interviewed separately.) The dvd I got came with 2 discs, I suppose this is the only release to DVD so far so they all will be 2 disc? Quality was very good. :) If you're a big fan of Gary's, I HIGHLY recommend this flick. Very amusing, and interesting, and good Shakespearian fun : 
This is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone. This wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare's HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet's melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince. In this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps. It helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style. It helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier. It is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn. It's is fun. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of Shakespeares works. It does help to have an idea of Hamlet, and I would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost. It gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of Hamlet. 
Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
What a masterpiece! I remember watching this program when I was a pre-teen in the mid-fifties. The film footage, Fred Allen's narration, and Robert Russell Bennett's musical accompaniment are nothing short of captivating. A must see for students of that era 
I was duped into thinking this was a music performance video. It's nothing but a documentary about the '20s. As a documentary, it's great, but definately not for a music buff (musician), like me, who collects music videos 
Best overall look at the 1920's for students and the people interested in the 20's. Music is right with the times and the film is vintage. Fred Allen is the the host and his old radio voice is right out of the Jazz Age! 
My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss. Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD. Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion. Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it. One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld. The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it. According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history. So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge. On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease." Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software. "Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES. This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes). So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect. Even the bad guys seem familiar. Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer. They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl. Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree. The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner. A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development. I am normally opposed to remakes. For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films. The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake. But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original. The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life. As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive. For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs. The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects. The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle. My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum. All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film. It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation: JURASSAIC PARK. Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks. Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie. 
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie 
A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood. Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World. Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale. Seriously, why is somebody not making this already 
I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night. She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film. One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene. I like chase scenes. Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection. A few good comic shots. Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break. 
I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!  
It was a great movie. If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there. I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real. It was a movie worth buying 
In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them. Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land". The DVD has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi. Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall 
you wont be disappointed. Very good acting. I recomend this movie. The acting is very good. The actors are awesome 
I am currently a medical student, hoping to have a future career working specifically with HIV/AIDS patients. When I ordered this movie, I was expecting any typical drama movie that is not well dramatized. When I received the movie, I watched it before taking it to class the next day and I was just shocked at how informed I was of the disease. It is so INCREDIBLE! I took the movie to school the next day and everyone that has NOT seen the movie had the same reaction that I had. Even the teacher had watched it before and was still moved by it. If you are unsure of buying it, I can tell you that it is a movie to own if you are into true life dramas. Everytime that I watch it, I am still floored by how our world had changed by this epidemic! 
I never really knew of Matthew Modine until I saw this movie. He was very good in the part and I have watched the movie several times. I also purchased the book as well. 
If you are not familiar with research, this nice approach to a scientist's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies. Besides, this very interesting and moving film, with high level and homogeneous performances, will show, the closest it can, the early facts about such a terrible disease. I strongly recommend it. I have seen it with my 16 year old son, but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age. A bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience. 
The film is well-done in all aspects, definitely worth seeing if you have any interest in the way the world began to track the AIDS epidemic back around 1980. I was a newspaper editor in Oklahoma at the time, and I remember the early news stories which first hinted that something big and bad was brewing in the gay community. Although I am straight, I have friends of that sexual preference, and in fact, one of my sister's oldest and dearest friends was an early casualty of this killer disease. Even better than this movie, however, is the source book by the late Randy Shilts, who was a journalist in San Francisco (who happened to be gay, and who happened to contract and die of AIDS eventually.) The non-fiction book is huge, but it is gripping. AIDS is still with us, and is a heterosexual scourge in Africa, so this story is not as dated as one might think. 
I received this product on time and in perfect shape. I enjoy the high quality of Amazon's site 
It's been 25 years and so much in the gay community has changed and so much hasn't. A quarter century ago it seemed unthinkable that Love and Death could ever co-exist. Now we live in the midst of an uneasy truce. See this film and see how the first generation dealt with the unthinkable 
I really liked this DVD. Hard as it was to watch for all the painful memories it brings flooding back into the forefront of the consciousness. The callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness of the Reagan Administration as those it considered lesser Americans lay in hospitals suffering and dying. This DVD shows Dr Gallo as a shallow man with a vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin to human compassion unless of course the camera's were rolling. The film shows the CDC being headed by political hacks who elevated the collected arts of administrative spin control, reckless indifference to suffering \ death of people it did not like and stonewalling to the stuff of mythic legend. While the DVD shows the ugliest demons of the human heart laid bare that the whole world might see it also shares the most humane and tender moments of the early days of before HIV / AIDS got those names. The film showed how even in one of america's darkest hours when true presidental leadership was asleep at the switch, the little people those deep inside government did all they could to protect the public health living up to the highest standards for onr called to offer themselves in service to our nation. The DVD simply told the truth and it is left pretty much to the viewer to make up his or her own mind what they think of those times. There were some moving facts at the end of the DVD all now quite dated. I guess the thing that caught me so totally off guard was the running tally showing the numbers of sick and dying people from the earliest days of the epidemic. It is so sad how the Reagan adminstration so viciously sat on its hands doing nothing while so many died in an epidemic that it might not have stopped but it might have slowed significantly had it only acted with the same fortitude at home that it mustered in Beruit or Libia. Yes I dwell too much on the sickening aspects of those times because just seeing it again after having lived through it makes me mad. Seeing this DVD just convinces me that had we a real leader in the white house when AIDS HIV GRID Gay Cancer first burst onto the scene things might have not been so grim. But this DVD is so much more than the venom and pain of loss it also highlights human kind at its best. There is much love in this DVD balanced with the grim realities of the day. Back in the day I can not say I was on the front lines, because indeed I was not. I think this movie is a must have for anyone's collection and at its current price it can not be beat. Of course I brought a copy and might buy another for a spare to lend out for teaching purposes. This DVD is pretty accurate HIV history as it should be told 
One of the best films, adapted from a book. very touching true story, and the acting impecable, Richard Gere gives a great performance as a man confronting his mortality 
a perfect concent in a beautiful location. i've watched this innumerable times and always enjoy it. filmed long before many of the band's pop hits attracted a wider audience and demonstrates the depth of their playlists. 
I bought this video second-hand for the extortionate sum of 1 before discovering that many fans were deparately trying to locate a copy. So it may not have the sound or picture quality that we have come to expect these days, but as a teenager who is sadly too young to have seen the real thing, the video gives an impressive insight into what The Cure were as a live band. Another Cure creation which left me mouth-open in awe. Sometimes I feel like I was born too early.. 
First off, I'm giving this 5 stars because this concert is superb if purchased in the correct format. But the point of my review is to comment on the Video CD (VCD) version. When I first heard of this, I (foolishly) got excited about this because it boasted digital sound and picture. Well, this is meaningless considering this format only allows 1.3 gigs to work with in a double CD format, whereas DVD's give at least 4.7 gigs to work with. The video is so compressed that it is not clear at all - very grainy. And the sound, what a joke! First, it is terribly thinned out. The bass and drums are almost non-existent. The percussion triggers are not there, and the effects on Robert's voice are also completely gone. Possibly worst of all, the sound is sped up a bit, and this just makes it sound extra terrible. Whoever produced this VCD must have been a complete nitwit. I'm convinced The Cure didn't have any oversight of this horrendous product at all. On the other hand, the Galore VCD is better. The picture is still a bit lacking, but the sound is at least "correct." The mix and speed is right; it just sounds a little thin. Anyway, my final point is don't let the word "digital" fool you. A VHS tape beats any VCD hands down any day. If you're still not satisfied with VHS, there is a laserdisc of In Orange, but it is not without its own flaws. Although the picture quality is great, the drums are a bit distorted when compared to the VHS, and the audio/video sync is quite off in parts. In this case, it really seems that VHS is the way to go 
I had this a long time ago when I was a teenager, but must have lost it while moving at some point or somehting. I used to watch it over and over and OVER. Great collection of songs. Great camerawork and very energetic performance by the band. I feel that 'Trilogy' is really boring compared to this. I saw The Cure live in DC on The Prayer Tour in '89 (my first concert) and it too was a very lively performance. Maybe that's why I like this video so much. Anyway, I am buying a used copy on Amazon right now and I can't wait to receive it so I can watch it over and over and OVER! 
This "live" concert video from "The Head on the Door" tour in the mid-80's is a masterpiece! The setting is classic Cure. The set list is chock full of all their early stuff. The renditions here of "A Hundered Years" and "A Forest" are worth the price of admission. This video is currently out-of-print but if you're lucky enough to get your hands on a copy, GRAB IT! Whether your a fan of early Cure or not, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED by this selection 
This is simply and amazing concert. I highly recommend it to any Cure fan, for it is a must-have. The set is awesome and includes almost every song of the The Head On The Door album, one of the best Cure albums. With a gorgeous setting and atmosphere, at this old french castle in Orange, the mood is set for an overwhelming Cure experience. Get it now while you can 
This is an awesome video.If you like The Cure, you will love this video. It is full of classic Cure songs and is lovely to watch. If you get a chance to get this video, or even just view it once (it is out of print) TAKE IT 
Ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house. 8 women, every one of them with their affective lacks, their tribulations. Little miseries, sorrows and disillusions. Each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered Marcel. The admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage, with a sublime red carpet that remind us Bergman in Cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo) expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film, plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses. A must-see! 
Seemingly a French take-off on the classic English Mystery Play format this delightful farce is actually a perfect proof of how great and sexy, women of all ages are (especially French women). Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Virginie Ledoyen, Ludivine Sagnier, Isabelle Huppert, Danielle Darrieux, Fanny Ardant, Firmine Richard, Emmanuelle Bï¿½art 
A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all. I thought that the plot, the scenery, the songs and everything else was all great. It is a French musical whodunnit but one that doesn't take itsself too seriously. Whoever wrote the bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either (besides, it's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie, so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate.) My favorite characters were played by Denouve and Huppert (both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights) and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained, even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required. Then again, it is a musical, so disbelief should be left at the door 
Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid 
The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness. Nor even, for that matter, for titillation. When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why. Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies. Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange. By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience. 
Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle Bart was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais. Deneuve, Bart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in. What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes! The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good! Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add 
This farcical "who done it" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time. Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek "who done its" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death. Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country. Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion. While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about. The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties. (Note Suzon's pink/orange pony skirt.) To quote a line from the film, "it's a sad family affair" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight. Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film. Strange. In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs. Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered. She looks stately, beautiful and more than a bit spoiled. Danielle Darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother, Mamy. Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid. Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law. The cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet fifties-ish way. In a kind of gender joke, no men appear in the movie, although we do see the back of Marcel (Gaby's husband) a couple of times. You will not be able to guess who done it, but I will not tell you why. See this for Danielle Darrieux, one the grande dames of the French cinema whose film credits go back to 1931--yes, 1931. She has a lot of fun in a juicy part 
Yes, this murder mystery is twisted and dark, but also wonderful to watch. All the characters (with the possible exception of the father) are so intriguing and bizarre...and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat. What a nasty family, but one can't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates. They put the fun in the word dysfunctional, without a doubt. Beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery. True that it is primarily shot indoors, but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright. Maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot, I don't know, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes. The story itself is pretty good, and not difficult to follow, but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss. 
8 women is a good musical/ murder mystery with humor, light heartedness and mystery. It combines a bunch of the best French actrices, and an enjoyable plot. A real guesser until the end 
I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it. If you like Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, you won't be dissappointed with this movie. 
ive been trying to buy this dvd for ages and from many places but i only found it on amazon.com . film was clear and delivery was ok to . 
My husbands laughs when I say a movie is my favorite(I have many favorites), but this one really is. I also love to read and what sets this adaptation apart is the way the two complement eachother,truly brilliant. The movie adds elements that the book didn't dwell on and the book covers all the details that movies just can't. Some movies can touch your heart in such a way that they leave you a bit raw. For me, this is one of those movies. No, it may not be a cinematic event for all, but for those who have loved with their whole heart and have been (or even risked) being hurt, you will find a good laugh and a few tears here. Only Nora Ephron herself could have wrote a screenplay that complemented her novel so well, and thankfully Mike Nichols brought it to life in such a way. Meryl Streep really is at her best here and the whole cast is excellent. I really do love this movie, it always amazes me that it is so underrated. Give it a try 
A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull 
The first time I saw this film was when it came out in 1986, and at the time I was terribly disappointed. Didn't like the film at all, thought it was amateurish and pretentious. But then I watched it recently on DVD, and realized that it was a really good film - performances were all really good, I liked seeing the DC scenery, and the directing by Mike Nichols was wonderfully subtle. Despite the fact that both Nicholson and Streep can sometimes be overpowering, and that Nicholson did get a bit hammy at times in this (I still can't abide the scene where he sings), I found both of their performances to be deep and nuanced. The co-stars were good too, added a lot, and I especially enjoy Catherine O'Hara's portrayal of a gossip. Carly Simon's singing really does set the tone well for this movie, which is definitely worth watching. And if you don't like it the first time, watch it again in a year or two, and I'll bet you'll re-appraise it more positively 
I avoided this movie when it was released because I couldn't imagine that a film based on the marital breakup of Nora Ephron and Carl Bernstein would interest me. Although I am an admirer of both these folks for their talents as writers, I had always agreed with Richard Burton when he said, when asked if he would be writing about his marriage and breakup with Elizabeth Taylor, that even though love might be dead, that it wasn't for sale. Be that as it may, this movie is certainly worth seeing. Although the plot is a little thin, there are some very funny moments. (Whether some of the events actually happened in the Bernstein/Ephron saga doesn't matter.) Any film directed by Mike Nichols, starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, with cinematography by Nestor Amendros is well worth seeing. Both Ms. Ephron and the viewer have the last laugh. 
At four hour-long episodes, we are merely there and back again in too short a time. (Even worse, the entire first hour alone is devoted to the preparation of the series.) While informative and insightful into the everyday life of a middle-class English family in the year 1900, this series is simply too short. It's not nearly as grand in scope as my favorite, "Manor House" series. While Manor House was isolated in the country, the 1900 house is situated in the middle of a modern neighborhood with cars visible out any window. People dressed in modern clothes stop by and the family shops at a present-day market. While the interior of the house is accurate to the last teacup, the outside world intrudes too much and breaks the illusion of living in the past. Don't get me wrong, 1900 House is very much worth watching -- but the journey is over far too quickly. An absolute must-see for anyone interested in the sufferage movement or women's studies 
A modern day family gets thrown into 1900 to catch a glimpse of the difficulties that familes in that day endured. The house the family lived in was equipped with the highest technology of 1900. The family had to dress as people did in that day, they had to cook and eat as people did in 1900, and they had to use the same kind of cleaning and hygiene supplies that were available. There was a camera in one of the closets where the family would give their opinion of how they were living in the house 
I'm not sure how they could have made 1900 House better. When the participants break the rules they point out how things would have really been in 1900. It's ludicrous to suggest that the producers could have created more context for the show. To do so - to create lavish social conditions (more participants, social gatherings, etc.) - would have been well beyond the scope and budget of the project. Viewer response to this show versus Colonial House is also revealing. 1900 House participants broke the rules all the time - they bought shampoo, they treated the maid better than a Victorian family would have, etc. More importantly, the father and the children had lives outside the home in the modern era. Essentially, these people had it easy compared to Colonial House who were mandated to have zero contact with anything remotely modern. It seems that critics of Colonial House have a political agenda. Any and all criticisms about participants breaking the rules and this somehow ruining the show is mindless. Living as they did in the past, whether it be the US colonial era or 1900 Victorian London, would be misery for the vast majority of people living in the western world. People aren't robots. If you want a show where all the actors appear to follow the rules watch a fictional drama. But then, all you'll be watching are professional actors playing a part. You won't be seeing people live, suffer and even enjoy the lifestyles of the past - which is the whole point of making these programs in the first place. Last word: 1900 House, like Colonial House, is a great television for adults and children alike. It's our loss that more programs like this aren't produced 
This is a wonderful and interesting documentary about a family who are in England and take a challenge to spend time in a house acting like they are living in 1900. They go through many emotional times and its very interesting to see how things were back then. Make sure u see this fun and interesting 3 part (i think) dvd. i just wish i knew if there were any extras or updates on this fun family 
Shown on PBS and produced by the BBC. With much fanfare and publicity, a London radio station put out the call for an English family to volunteer for 3 months of turn of the century living in an authentic Victorian house. The 'winning' family didn't have an easy time of it. But one must wonder, why not, have we become so spoiled as to have trouble living as about half the world still does today? No electricity, wood stove heat, limited hot water, outdoor privy. Last summer I drove from Tuscon to Mazatlan, Mexico and for 1000 miles, every villa, every hacienda, everybody lived that way. No phone, electricity, TV, running water, cars, etc. Same way they live in Africa, India, China, Siberia and more countries than not. Still, an interesting film from a Socialogical standpoint. Better is 'Frontier House' where they're sent to Montana to spend a summer as pioneer settelers. Difficult to find but a splendid study 
A great movie. I liked this movie because I like the way Sinatra talks and sings. He is a natural actor always ready with a 'tough-guy' quip delivered with perfect pace and vocal variety. Kim Novak for me is a fabulous actress. Not only is she beautiful but she plays the part of a shy and hesitant starlet perfectly. The songs and the story are great both of which I have transfered to my i-pod to listen to over and over again. 
This movie, if nothing else, defines my childhood. Appearing on "The Children's Hour" with Ed Herlihy every Saturday, amid early morning rehearsals, and all that, I saw this movie at least 20 times! Mom was a real Sinatra fan. There have been so many remakes of what are now considered clsssic songs by Sinatra and gang, but(thanks to Mom) I have the original LP and know a good rendition when I hear it. If ever. Guess you had to be there and experience the movie. I was just 8-years-old at the time and, even at that age, able to figure out that "Pal Joey" was something special. It's fun! It's a lark!! It's an era!!! It's Rogers and Hart!!! 
Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception. Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either. Rita is the fading star. It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow. The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad. Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos. It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself. Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool. Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals. Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog. He stole every scene he was in. Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie 
I suppose much can be said about this movie's lack of faithfulness to the stage play. A hardened Joey, a more callous Joey, an essentially darker Joey... these things are worth exploring and would be interesting to see. Also, if the cut songs are as good as the ones included, then we have indeed lost much, for the numbers in the film are uniformly excellent. With that said, there is nothing wrong in having the cynic in us take a back burner for once, and watching a pretty decent feel-food movie with a fabulous cast, superb performances, and really excellent music. Perhaps the one downer in the film is Kim Novak who, even though she does a respectable job in "My Funny Valentine", still manages to irk. Reminiscent of a female Keanu Reeves (she was great in "Vertigo" for a reason: She just had to act doe-eyed and aloof. Perfect!) she is pretty annoying here. Oh, and lest we forget, the dream sequence is also burdensome, but it was almost a rite of passage before the ending of a whole lot of musicals, so we'll tolerate it here. As for the great aspects of the film, there are many: Rita Hayworth is excellent, with "Zip" as her defining moment in the film. Sinatra, of course, is simply fantastic, and elevates the "Lady is the Tramp" sequence to new heights of artistry. Buy it for Sinatra, fall in love with Rita Hayworth, and tolerate Kim Novak 
This film is worth watching over and over again, if only to see Sinatra's rendition of "The Lady is a Tramp", which he sings with riveting style and musical finesse. Based on a book and play by John O'Hara, it boasts some snappy dialogue and a fabulous Rodgers and Hart score, with songs like "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered", "I Could Write a Book", "What do I Care for a Dame ?", "Plant You Now, Dig You Later", "Happy Hunting Horn" and "That Terrific Rainbow". Rita Hayworth does a sumptuous "Zip" (I love the way she uses her lavish Jean Louis gown in the number), and Kim Novak is absolutely stunning singing "My Funny Valentine". Novak was one of the loveliest and most underrated stars to ever grace the silver screen, and this was her second film with Sinatra, having done the dramatic "The Man with the Golden Arm" two years earlier. The film only received some Oscar nominations (Art/Set Direction, Costume Design, Editing, Sound), but Sinatra did pick up a 1958 Golden Globe Best Actor/Musical-Comedy for his part as Joey, the womanizing, fast talking, con-man singer, who goes from town to town, leaving debts and broken hearts behind; Sinatra makes the most of the part, and one cannot imagine anyone else that could have played Joey to such perfection. Terrific direction by George Sidney and choreography by Hermes Pan complement this trio of great stars and splendid music, with the backdrop of San Francisco and Harold Lipstein's cinematography. Total running time is 109 minutes. 
This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them. For a theater lover this is heartbreaking. What a disappointing story. If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer. Even the ending was changed and not for the better. The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing. A pretty face is not enough 
We've had this LP for years and I've never seen the movie til yesterday. The soundtrack conjours up all sorts of visual images, and seeing the music on film was fabulous. This is Frank at his best, and the "mouses" played by Kim Novak Rita Hayworth were sensational. 
Follow this video to the T and you will not be disappointed. Stick with the program and your dog will be as good a hunting dog as anyone can expect to be lucky enough to have 
When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think. Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for "enjoyment." That being said, I love this movie, and here's why. 1. It's a true story. 2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the "wrong" country. How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country? This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian. If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time 
IN A NUTSHELL: UNDERRATED - UNDERVALUED - UNDEREXPOSED - Excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event! It is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are ideally suited as Soviet naval Captains, and as believable as their rebuilt authentic K-19! Kathryn Bigelow who Directed and Produced the film did an incredible job, which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the DVD. BOTTOM LINE: THIS NEW KIND OF SUB FILM IS A PART OF HISTORY If you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best. If you enjoy thrillers, this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone. 
For those who don't know russian the title of this was (Просмотрение K-19 - Review of K-19, thought I'd be funny there) This movie is not so much a combat movie it's a what happened movie. The flagship of the Russian Navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 Captians, yea that kinda don't go over so well. They have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys. It is quite a gripping movie though. This is also one that needs to be bought not just rented 
This was a true story and a scary part of our history. The book comes to life in the movie... I pictured another person as the captain of the Sub... Mr. Ford did a good job acting the part 
I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice 
There are so much information about this movie in Amazon.com description and other reviews so I don't want to repeat them. The only problem in this movie was Harisson Ford's style, he was acting more American than Russian and for moments you may feel that K-19 is an American submarine and Harisson Ford is an American Captain. He was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts, he couldn't deny his American Friquent Style! I think Harrison Ford for this movie was not a wise Decision. I know, starring First class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie 
K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense. Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men. Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571". The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
I recently bought this video for my son for Hanukkah, and am so happy I did. Every day when he gets home from school he puts in the tape, and will play it over and over. He loves this movie so much, that he recently asked me to purchase it for his cousin! I reccomend every parent buy this tape for their young ones if they love to dance 
Good movie to show people the difference between ballroom dance and fun dance. Best dance movie I ever seen 
If you like to dance or like to watch other people dance then this is the movie for you. That's especially true if you like a latin beat in your music. Nice story line and in the end girl not only gets the trophy but gets the guy also! A little laughing and a little crying and a lot of dancing. What more could you ask for. 
This is a great movie!!!! I loved the music, dancing, and the intense chemistry between the actors. I especially enjoyed the handsome, sexy Chayanne!!! He's an excellent singer, dancer, and actor!! He and Vanessa looked amazing together. I prefer this movie to Dirty Dancing. If anyone wants to see and hear more of Chayanne, he's in a new commercial, and has realeased a new video from his latest album Cautivo, which has gone multi-platinum! 
I usually stay away from the chick-flick genre that I was forced to watch with my ex-wife, daughter and, prior to that various and sundry dates...but, from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film, I was drawn into the world of proffesional Latin dancing. I readily admit that my initial interest was to see Vanessa, since, in my opinion, she makes too few films. But, the infectious sountrack and the easy-looking, but incredibly intricate dance performances of Chayanne and crew, made me say, to quote a line from the film, "I want to do that, too!" Chayanne, who is probably a superstar in latin circles, gives a utilitarian acting performance, however appealing his personality, and this whole movie was never in danger of being an oscar contender, however, I reiterate, the dance sequences are exilerating. A solid family movie, and with the popularity of "Dancing With the Stars," should be a must-see for fans of that show 
After watching the film and wanting to get up and dance to the music this CD is a dream come true ! "Echa Pa'Lante" is now one of my favourite Cha Cha's and Ruby's Rumba "Eres Todo En Mi" is great to dance with a special partner. "Jazz Machine - Black Machine" is a great Samba track which will also get you on the dance floor. If the film inspired you to get up and dance this CD should be on your playlist 
This is a nice movie. Not an Oscar winner, but very pleasant and no sex (a virtue/shortcoming depending on your point of view). I purchased the movie for the salsa dancing, but all of the dancing and music in the movie are great. From the opening scenes staged in Cuba to the last dance scene the the movie is big time fun. It also is beautifully filmed. Chaynne and Vanessa are both easy on the eyes so each gender will enjoy it. The movie is defintely worth a viewing 
I love a good dance movie and this is one for the collection. This dvd sells for about $7.00 at thiat price it is a very good buy 
This movie is great. Vanessa Williams is not only beautiful, but you would think she has been competing in professional Latin dancing for real-she is very talented. Chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming-not to mention easy on the eyes. The dance scenes are HOT!! It is loaded with not only great dances, but great Latin music and likable characters. It is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor!!!   
Ninety percent opinion, ten percent fact. For more in-depth analysis and much harder hitting investigation based on mainstream media reporting view any of Alex Jones' later films. 9/11: The Road to Tyranny, Martial Law: Rise of the Police State, and TerrorStorm are far better. Heck, you can view them all for free on Google and YouTube. Alex is a man so concerned with getting the word out that he releases all his works for free HIMSELF 
of course, 20/20 hindsight is always nice in cases like this, but, i was a huge supporter of this film when it was still 'against the country' to do so...i reviewed it back then for 'another' publication, and, of course, as we know, many people lost their jobs over such a 'treasonous act'...(fortunately, i was not one of them...)... but time has revealed to (almost) all that the bush administration lied from the get-go and has been lying ever since... and contrary to one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida...KNOCK IT OFF!!!!!!...when the 'so-called' recount was done, it never took into account all the 'illegal' butterfly ballots that had candidates names on both sides of the ballot (which is againast florida state law), causing many to vote for pat buchanan by accident...(no to mention the disinfranchised democrats who weren't allowed to vote due to republican strong-arming...) and, the sad fact that, by now, that i would still have to tell anyone left in america about the wicked ways of this administration, just goes to prove that some, no matter how much truth is placed before them, will still ignore common sense and follow the path that leads to their own destruction... next time, this country better not wait for the 'bell curve' to catch up with those who already know.. 
I counted ~15 factual errors (aka lies) during Michael Moore's opening speech.* I stopped shortly after. I'm not going to waste my time on such obviously factually-wrong fiction. How stupid does Mr. Moore think we are? I was *there* watching the election unfold, and what he reported is NOT what happened. * Example: He said FOX News pressured NBC, cbs, abc, and cnn to change their minds, and give Florida to Gore, and then Bush. What a load of lies. FOX news has no power over the other nets. NBC, cbs, abc, cnn operate independently, and reached their decisions independently, without influence from Fox. * And furthermore, the other nets did NOT call for bush (as Moore falsely claimed). They labeled Florida "undecided", and left it that way for several days. * Also, Moore claimed that a recount showed Gore won Florida. FALSE. A bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later, and not only did Bush win, but the recount *increased* his lead from a few hundred to several thousand, because of conservative communities in western Florida. (Many other non-biased groups found the same result.) This video reminds me of his Columbine documentary, where men's ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches (it's called creative editing). Moore has no ethics. Propagandist. As far as I'm concerned, he's no better than a KKK member. Same mental disorder illogic. 
First, I give this 5 stars because of the subject matter and the subject matter's importance, AND the supplemental interviews and DVD extras; but not for the quality of the documentary filmmaking. More about that in a moment... The subject matter is very, very, deadly serious. Easily the most important subject matter of this decade and certainly one of the top issues of the last 40 years. Regardless of whether you consider yourself in one political camp or another, or neutral; you should know that the documentary looks at both individual, very personal concerns such as a mother who lost her son in the war, and also examines much broader, political and economic aspects and questions that deserve attention, and intelligent, calm discussion. **** Even if you have seen the film and disagree, you should WATCH THE DVD SUPPLEMENTAL footage. If you miss these additional parts, you are missing 50% of the information. Please see #2 below And if you are critical of the main documentary's viewpoint, you may welcome the fact that the supplemental material is largely unedited, running footage devoid of any particular viewpoint from the film's authors. This documentary well deserves the praise for being one of the first to approach this subject at a time when virtually the entire Western world media would not (or could not) go near this topic. When national fever is high and any questioning of the war effort is considered "treason," "unpatriotic," and "morally wrong;" our constitutional rights such as free speech and free assembly are in serious danger. The documentary portrays this, but (unfortunately) only in a sidelight fashion (one of many problems). In fact, I'm not sure the filmmakers realized this was one of the greatest overriding issues. If common citizens were better informed, the insane actions and atrocities would have never happened. Yet, the documentary displays this serious, national problem of the absentee press graphically and without any possible misinterpretation. Both within the US and in other parts of the world, censorship and denial is taking place. But it doesn't make the points strongly or clearly enough. Because this film and its issues have been seen now by tens of millions, it is part of our culture and that effect is growing. To dismiss it without seeing it in its entirety (plus the supplemental materials!) is going to cast doubt on anyone who tries to discuss the documentary but doesn't know firsthand how the information is presented. Basically, you can't attack the documentary's ideas unless you watch the documentary. Hearing about it from your uncle or coworker will not be an acceptable working knowledge. Furthermore, since these are gigantic political and life-threatening issues, every citizen has a duty to be as informed as possible. We can't have a country that goes to war, invades another 2 other countries, kills and permanently maims tens of thousands of its own soldiers and tens of thousands of citizens in the other countries, puts another 20,000+ in jail for six+ years, commits acts of torture by the thousands, and then has a substantial part of its own population refuse to consider this as right or wrong, and refuses to spend 2 hours of their time watching a easily available documentary that might shed new light or viewpoints on this situation. That being said, Michael Moore's and his filmmaking team's documentary skills and decisions are sometimes good, but other times quite poor. This documentary has several problems, and these have nothing to do with facts being correct or other content issues; this is strictly about the documentary filmmaking *process* and the decisions made in the creation of this work. -- Big Problem #1: If you have a film titled "Fahrenheit 9/11", don't start the film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities. Any filmmaker knows that every minute, and every second, of their footage is precious, especially the first 10 minutes. A documentary on our nationwide election problems is just fine. But that's another documentary; maybe a really good one, but I don't think it should have been included, except perhaps at the end. By starting off with material not directly related to the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Moore has given his critics ample fodder for criticism and rejection in the beginning, even if the reason for that rejection has flaws. This decision was a huge presentation blunder, and stole precious resources that could have been used to set up and structure the rest of the material, and prepare the audience for what was ahead. In its final form, this information is irrelevant to the next 90 minutes and barely remembered after it's all over. -- Big Problem #2: As mentioned above, the filmmakers did not appear to have a good grasp of the subjects they were documenting, and there's no strong sense of what is important and what's not. The results are missed opportunities, a barrage of information, and a lack of clarity. The information is not well organized, and it's not summarized or reviewed at times when a new viewer needs time to catch their breath. This is a problem with editing and pacing; and understanding how a viewer or audience will mentally keep track of everything. That doesn't mean the material is incorrect or faulty, it means it's assembled and presented poorly. As a comparison, I'd say it was like reading a book by starting with the last chapter, then backing up one chapter at a time. Sure, you read the book and all the words, but the people, information, story, and connections are going to be a lot harder to put together with that kind of approach. We see a lot of really important information. There's no doubt about that. But what are the most important points? You might name 3, but someone else might name 3 completely different ones. And both would be right! However, this shouldn't happen if the documentary is well made. -- Big Problem #3: The film doesn't possess a good structure. It's not a particularly linear piece, neither does it follow several simultaneous information or storylines. It doesn't have a "scientific" approach or any other good format. Instead it's an assembly line of data but fails to add up to a finished product, and following this analogy, some information falls off the assembly line and is easily forgotten. Again, this doesn't mean the data is wrong, this is a mistake of filmmaking; and in all fairness, it's the sort of mistake one would expect from someone not well skilled at creating documentaries. It's not amateur, but it's not tight and coherent either. The material is both dense emotionally explosive, and hard to digest, especially if you aren't familiar with all the facts. But the presentation doesn't work to help the viewer through this, and connect the many pieces of information or give time for pause and review. Instead, the presentation is relentless and has a zigzag structure which takes away from the power of the material rather than combine it to something stronger. For instance, we see critically important censorship and denial on the part of the media, but it's not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all the other information and data, and neither are the implications of this media black hole. This needed stronger, more focused presentation. The great crime that a war for "freedom" has denied "freedom of the press" is very likely lost to many viewers. Add to this a seemingly never-ending series of musical jokes and segments, which I can't even guess at their purpose. Here we are watching this [literally] deadly serious material, and suddenly we have silly rock music and images, like some low-grade music video. This type of decision is truly amateur and pathetic; and just as shameful as the people being being joked about. If the documentary filmmakers don't treat the subject with seriousness, how can they ridicule other people? But this documentary shouldn't have jokes. In fact, no "true documentary" would ever take this lunatic approach, and this behavior easily opens up the entire subject to ridicule. It's incomprehensible how any documentary would be created with this type of approach. Shame on the producers, distributors, and anyone else involved with the production for not stepping forward and "telling the emperor he has no clothes." This juvenile, dimwit approach disgraces the production and insults everyone who has suffered from the craziness of "Fahrenheit 9/11". This should never have happened. -- Big Problem #4: Every moment of the film should be about runaway crazy "Fahrenheit 9/11," but it isn't. As an example, President Bush bangs the podium and exclaims the usual nonsense about terrorists hating freedom and hating American goodwill. So why not show the real reasons? Like the fact that the United States sold arms to Iran and Iraq as they fought each other years ago, creating immense hostility throughout the Middle East towards the US? A little information, to either remind or inform the viewer of the real reasons for the hatred goes a long way to proving how we received an endless stream of lies and misleading information about the entire situation. Better yet, since you are doing a documentary, why not ask a variety of experts on the subject, and have them explain and agree or disagree with "terrorists hate America and freedom". Instead, precious moments in the documentary are stolen with largely dead or irrelevant material, such as when Michael Moore stands outside the Saudi Embassy with Secret Service coming to ask questions. It's interesting, but belongs in the supplemental materials section. That is not something that qualifies as national hysteria or "Fahrenheit 9/11". And it opens both Michael Moore and his entire team to criticisms of grandstanding and trying to be performers and part of the story instead of good documentary filmmakers. Here's one of the most important things you should know: In the original film documentary, we see a US military raid on a civilian home suspected to harbor terrorists To my utter dismay, we see in the supplemental materials this is part of a much larger story with 10 times as much impact, with disgusting, barbaric and outrageous disrespect for ordinary citizens by our soldiers. Unfortunately this is lost and jumbled in the original cut. The Swedish reporter with the US military unit tells us that no one, including Swedish media, would present this shocking and horrifying behavior. Furthermore, only the supplemental material lets us have an idea of the type of documentary footage Michael Moore and his team had to work with. In this well-documented sequence from the Swedish journalists, we see one of our military units invade an ordinary family's home and our soldiers physically and mentally abusing and terrorizing ordinary citizens, including tormenting a crippled old man. Apparently they didn't understand its importance. THEN! ... we find out that one of the soldiers was drunk, and soldiers hit the old man's penis repeatedly, and this all happens with the commanding officer watching calmly to the side. Why on earth wasn't this included in the main documentary? This isn't as bad as Abu Ghraib torture sessions, but it's dynamite material nevertheless. And then we are told this is not anything unusual; in fact it's commonplace! Showing our military behaving like this is extremely important footage, and shows why people in Iraq and the Middle Eastern world have learned to hate the United States more and more each year. Yet, this crucial segment is poorly presented and largely lost in the original documentary. Compared to some of the segments mentioned above, this is clearly more important. But, it was cast aside. I cannot understand this. It's hard to speculate, but if this was left out, we have to ask ourselves what other material has been discarded? This is, unfortunately, just plain bad decision-making in the documentary process, a real lack of comprehension about on the part of the documentary filmmakers; and poor workmanship compared to other documentary work. -- Final thoughts: At this point you may think my opinion of the documentary is poor and maybe not worth viewing, so let me avoid the film's mistake and summarize this: This is an exceedingly serious and important documentary, and I recommend it along with the supplemental materials to anyone who considers himself a good American, of moral conscience, or anyone who has interest in American politics and actions. You don't have to agree but you should be familiar with the material and see all of it. That's why it gets 5 stars. You need to watch this. However, I'm very critical of the documentary skill, or lack thereof, and a much better and threfore less controversial documentary could have been created from the same materials, and might have had a more positive impact and received wider acceptance. Even so, this needs to be seen. And if you are confused how I can give five stars to something with this many problems, let me repeat that just delving into this subject in the national, political environment of the time of its release was breakthrough and revolutionary. It would have been "great" in the hands of others 
Fahrenheit 9/11 just blew my mind when I saw it. It gives a complete new perspective on the politics of the US and on Bush's administration. The film's objectivity is not to be questioned, cause Michael Moore gives clear evidence on everything. This movie really shows what America is like in this new era and how innocent people die for its welfare. I am amazed that this film was actually released for the open public and that the author wasn't hanged on the street. I wouldn't be surprised if that happened 
Out of 5 stars, I give it a 10. If you haven't seen it, you're missing the past two decades. The information is right on the Money, in more ways than one 
Film footage was really important. I did not know that Bush had his car egged when he was inagurated the 1st time. I did not know that he was the 1st president not able to walk his last leg to the inaguration because of protests. I did not know because the bush administation had the media supressed at that time. I thought this movie was really important because it got out info for the 1st time that we could not see before. I would take a look at it and you can see things you did not see and know some things that you did not know. See for yourself. It is a rental now 
The bedlams that greet the current Republican Administration each morning for USA `involvement in Iraq' have actually relegated this DVD to second-rate. It is obvious that the producers of this so called `Documentary' are more likely to be fractious to Mr. Bush in particular than accommodating to the American public at large. It is also obvious that Mr Bush is not the type of person to succumb to self-pity. Mr Moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though. In the meantime I can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind 9/11 to unfold. 
I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc. That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO? Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
I guess I am in the minority here. I happened to think that "In Dreams" was not only a very good film, [and disturbing] but very different from so many other thrillers. As for the cast, they are all top-notch, contrary to many other reviews. Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) portrays a mother of a young girl, and Claire also happens to be clairvoyant. She begins having dreams of a child that is about to be abducted and killed. She implores her husband to contact the police, and they dismiss him and her as just another nut-case. However, the Dreams she is experiencing are her own daughter. She does not realize this until her daughter is abducted and murdered. She attempts suicide after learning of her daughters death. Moreover, she is taken to a psychiatric hospital for observation. The Doctor is portrayed by Stephen Rea. The serial killer is Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.). And his childhood was not a very pleasant one. He also is able to reach into Claire's dream, and she into his. As she begins to experience more and more of her visions, and connection with the killer, she decides to help the latest victim [a young girl] who has also been recently abducted by Vivian. This film is not for everyone, and I give a lot of credit to the director, and more importantly the writers for coming up with something new, even if parts of the film are flawed. I would recommend at least renting the DVD, to see if you like it before purchasing, however I felt it was a very surrealistic and extremely well done thriller. And as for Annette Bening, she is terrific as Claire. [Stars: 5+ 
In Dreams is an extremely surreal movie shot in beautiful colors and unforgettable imagery. Quite shocking and violent, the scenes will stay with you for days after viewing this. Annette Benning gives a top notch preformance she IS Claire!!!!And Robert Downey Jr. gives a chilling preformance as Vivian, the confused villan.Highly reccomended nail biter...just wait until the climax at the end on the bridge.. 
Movie: *1/2 DVD Quality: **** DVD Extras: *** Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; "In Dreams" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career). The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of "Psycho" and "The Silence of the Lambs", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score. Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie. Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile. In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable. Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question. The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with "Production Notes"; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights. "In Dreams" is not recommended viewing, even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value 
What a wonderfully bizarre thriller this is! Annette Benning's performance alone makes it worth watching - but there is still so much more. The story is so unsettling you never quiet get your grip once the film starts moving. From the opening credits - where a ghost town becomes submerged as a reservoir to the jump-out-of-your-seat ending, this one is a real keeper. The photography and set pieces are absolutely beautiful and do much put the viewer in Benning's head. A wild, frightening trip 
Somehow I feel that if this film had been even stranger, it may have been more critically popular. Had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the dream-logic plotlines it may have been hailed as a David Lynch-like fairy tale nightmare; add more violence and it could be a Dario Argento film. But instead we have something by Neil Jordan, who gives this film more wonder and magic (albeit dark) than anyone else could. I think it's a great film. See, it's called In Dreams, not In Logic. Its surreality is its strength, staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by Annette Bening. I think the plot contrivances are almost subversive; OF COURSE there are moments of coincidence because that's what happens in dreams. Moments of opportunity or clarity (claire-ity?) arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride. The film's general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir, and the fairy tale orchard. This is a Grim tale alright, but its beautiful, trippy and saturated in atmosphere. Killer ending too, closing a disturbingly satisfying thriller by a masterful director. Highly recommended for those who like to dream

Outstanding collection of first wave of British rock groups as they appeared when I first saw them at age 11, in live performances that really hold up. I remember now why I went right out, got a guitar, and grew my hair long after first seeing these in 1964. Includes the original commercials and Shindig cast. Recommended 
This is one of the most admirable and fresh films of any age. A true tour de force that invites us to enjoy and delight with the joy of living. Renoir the son, paid a more than deserved to his father with this post card movie, plenty of smart situations with a wonderful Jean Gabin and the most beautiful woman in the world in those ages: Maria Felix. The film is a glorious homage to Paris, depicting minuciously through every little frame every angle of this lovely city through anorigibal stage: since I got it in 1990, I have to watch it at least once every year. A colossal and superb artistic film that finds in Renoir the perfect director in the peak of his creative powers. This is the artistic answer given by France to "An american in Paris", and John Huston's"Le Moulin Rouge". Versatile imaginative, sumptuos and ravishing fil 
From the start, I blatantly refuse to compare this film to Huston's "Moulin Rouge" - these are two distinctly seperate works, and though their subject might be the same, it would be a disservice to the merits of both to place them on the same page. That having been said... From the great storyline to the rip-roaring dance finale, this is one heck of a movie-musical. Far, far too obscure, at least in this country - I've told innumerable friends about it, always with the same result - they tell me they've never heard of it. Well, now that you have, it's very well worth your time to check it out. Firstly, the character development is fantastic. Jean Gabin shines as the impresario Danglard, Francoise Arnould is wonderful as his ingenue/inspiration Nini, and Maria Felix is devastating as the diva, La Belle Abesse. As well, look for the glittering talents that surround - the peripheral characters are a delight to behold. And, of course, the great Edith Piaf makes a brief appearance, as well. Another quality I love about this film is the relatively accurate depiction of 1890's Paris - the costumes, colors and attitudes are well captured. The truth of the "casting couch" is openly mentioned, and relationships between performers and impresario are depicted with often saddening accuracy. On a lighter note, the dances are captured beautifully, as well - throughout the film they shine, in rehearsal rooms, dingy bars, and, of course, in the aforementioned finale. Overall, this is a most enjoyable film - and, unlike many "golden age" Hollywood musicals, it doesnt' shy away from the ugly truths of life in the theatre. Well worth a viewing - and very well worth purchase 
I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
I love John Grisham books, and though I've not read the Rainmaker, I do thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a David and Goliath story about an underprivileged family and a greener than grass lawyer taking on the mega-insurance company. (And believe it or not, I work for an insurance company!) The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film. The subplot of Rudy's love interest is a bit more than the movie really needs...I'd be interested to see if that portion exists or how it plays out in the book. Overall though, if you're looking for a nice solid movie, I'd recommend this one 
I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody 
Pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of John Grisham and bring it all onto the screen. They do a pretty good job. Matt Damon plays Rudy, a student in law school who's smart, broke, and about to make history. In the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer. The policy covered it but they would just not pay. Meantime Damons character is in deeper than ever, as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out. Read the novel, then watch the movie. It's really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving. Danny DeVito plays Damons partner in the film and it's one of the better roles I've seen him play. 
I loved this movie. Matt Damon, Clare Danes, Danny DeVito and especially Teresa Wright, give great performances 
It's a good story- it keeps the pace moving, and inserts nice little scenes of humor. And the best part? It's so close to the actual book. 
This is a great movie! Matt Damon is so great in this part of a Southern Lawyer starting out, and Mickey Rourke and Danny Devito are perfectly cast as the supporting partners to Matt's role. I love this movie and have already watched it over and over. A must see. 
This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Read the book if you want the backstory since the screenplay starts at the half point. It's entertaining and that's why we see movies in the first place, right? Matt Damon is just so darn likeable, you get drawn into his narration right off the bat. The screenplay was very well done. It IS a Coppola film, after all...he does work with some talented people. It was very nice to see Theresa Wright in this film, as well. 
I wasn't expecting much when I dropped this 1998 movie into the DVD player... There is a lot to commend itself. Matt Damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam! Danny Devito is slimy, shady, sarcastic, and sleazy (in other words, perfect Devito) as Damon's partner. The main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia. The sleazy Big Insurance Company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter. They bet wrong! Our hero, guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge (Dixon from Alias), come to the rescue. The pieces fit together quite nicely. Justice is served, bad guys are taken down, and Matt Damon establishes himself as an unlikely, unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process. Nothing wrong with this story or this film. Very delightful and satisfying in every respect. 
The Fridays gang steals some diamonds. Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be. His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve. Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin. Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something 
All about THE Benjamins is a funny @$$ movie.Mike Epps is funny. The polt of the movie is very interesting and funny. I recomend that you watch it soon if you have not seen it yet. :) 
I enjoyed this film about a bounty hunter (Ice T) who chases a con man who keeps eluding him. When the con man wins the mega lottery and then loses his ticket (in the boat of a nasty villian) he tries to enlist the aid of Ice T to get it back. Unfortunately for him, Ice T does not believe him about the ticket and is not only interested in collecting the bounty for the con man and also recovering several million in diamonds that a bad guy has. Eventually, Ice T starts to believe the con man and they somewhat work together but Ice T maintains a short leash on him until he can beat the villian and get the diamonds. There are some really hilarious scenes and both Ice T and the con man put in excellent performances. An overlooked gem that is as good as any of the Lethal Weapon films 
yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
Another hilarious cube vision movie. Mike Epps is one of the funniest guys on the planet and Cube's serious personna make for a classic goofy guy/straight guy combination. Get some popcorn, take a few deep breaths, cause you will laugh. Its a gas!! 
WOW. This movie is outrageous. It was a great movie for both Ice Cube and Mike Epps. They were both great in Next Friday, so I was ready for this movie. I recommend this movie to those who enjoy comedy with their action. There is a lot of both here. I also recommend Friday After Next, because Ice Cube and Mike Epps are in that as well 
I won't say much, except when you see this item listed in the used section, SNATCH IT! Worth it's weight in wheelbarrowed shrimp 
"Get A Life" was with out a doubt one of the funniest shows in the history of American television. It was an obvious inspiration for shows like 'South Park'. Chris Eliot's comic antics were some of the weirdest things I have seen since 'Monty Python', and I never thought things can get weirder then that! And 'Gus Borden', played to perfection by Brian Doyle Murry, is to this day one of my favorite characters in ALL of fiction. His insults to Chris while carrying around his copy of "Thigh World" almost had me pissing my pants. I highly recomend this show to people who understand stupid can be very funny 
Chris Elliott's comedy tends to polarize viewers -- you either think it's the funniest thing you've ever seen, or you become violently angry that someone like THAT has been allowed on teevee. If there were more people like the former, Get A Life would still be on the air, and Chris Elliott would be rich and famous. Unfortunately, here on Earth, the show got cancelled early, and until recently, has been unavailable on tape or on reruns. If you're the kind of person who finds watching incredibly stupid people (portrayed by smart comedians) doing incredibly stupid things unbearable, maybe you ought to look and see if you can get Friends or Seinfeld on cassette. If you enjoy smart comedy about stupid people written for smart people, do yourself a favor, buy this tape and give Rhino a few bucks, and convince 'em to release a few more volumes 
Here we go again with yet another disaster style epic from the 1970s. You know how the routine goes, don't you? Hire a bunch of big Hollywood names, some up and comers and some over the hill, and plop them down in the middle of a life-threatening situation. Irwin Allen made a career out of these types of films, weighing in with movies like "Earthquake," "The Swarm," "When Time Ran Out," "The Towering Inferno," and a bunch of other titles. Some chap named Ronald Neame brought us a movie about an ocean liner turned upside down by a tidal wave in the 1972 classic "The Poseidon Adventure," which Irwin Allen promptly followed up a few years later with "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure." Obviously, the law of diminishing returns kicked in with this much product floating around, and the disaster movie quietly slipped into coma until Hollywood resurrected the formula at the end of the 1990s with movies like "Armageddon," "Dante's Peak," and several others. One film that seems to have slipped through the cracks, however, is Richard Lester's 1974 thriller "Juggernaut." Here it is, given to us on DVD by none other than MGM. It's an interesting entry in the disaster genre. It's important to note that Lester readily subscribed to the idea that a disaster film needs an all-star cast. To meet this goal he hired Omar Sharif, Richard Harris, David Hemmings, Anthony Hopkins, Ian Holm, Freddie Jones, Shirley Knight, Clifton James, Julian Glover, and Roy Kinnear to play major and minor parts. If you don't recognize some of these names, you'll likely recognize their faces. Taken together these actors have made probably a few thousand films. Anyway, the plot is incredibly simple. An ocean liner called the Britannic sets sail from England with some 1,200 passengers aboard. Unfortunately for these folks there are also seven bombs in seven steel drums scattered throughout the ship. The first sign of trouble arrives when Nicholas Porter (Holm), the chief executive of the travel company that owns the Britannic, receives a terrifying phone call from an individual calling himself Juggernaut. This man tells Porter about the bombs on the boat, and demands that the company pay him half a million pounds within twenty-four hours. If someone decides to drag their feet, the bombs will detonate and sink the ship. Yummy. Predictably the cops and the government enter the picture, namely in the form of Scotland Yard investigator John McCleod (Hopkins) and bomb disposal expert Anthony Fallon (Harris). The passengers, despite the best efforts of Social Director Curtain (Kinnear) to cheer them up, soon discover exactly what's going on. They can't leave the ship, however, since a storm in the North Atlantic makes using the lifeboats a risky proposition. All they can do is sit helplessly by as Fallon and his crack commandos parachute into the sea and climb aboard the ship to defuse the explosives. Standing by to assist in the tricky operation is the ship's captain Alex Brunel (Sharif), his main squeeze Barbara Bannister (Knight), and McCleod's wife and two children who just happen to be passengers on the boat. Fallon soon discovers that Juggernaut is a crafty devil, an expert bomb maker with abilities that may well surpass his own. The movie from this point forward falls into the predictable pattern of showing us the passengers moving about the boat at the behest of Social Director Curtain, scenes of McCleod trying to track down Juggernaut back in London, and Nicholas Porter arguing with the government over the effectiveness of caving into the demands of the terrorist. Seeing as how "Juggernaut" is a bomb thriller, you can bet your bottom dollar that we'll see a scene where Fallon agonizes over which wire to cut. Red or blue? Times a wastin'! I went back and forth with "Juggernaut." No one can argue with the level of talent here, as every one involved turns in a solid performance. Unintentional snickers, though, must go to Roy Kinnear for his spirited rendition of "Roll Out the Barrels." It's also nice to see Roshan Seth in a small role as Azad, a lowly servant on the ship who makes the ultimate sacrifice (love that Al Pacino haircut too, man!). What I do take exception with is the uneven character development. I suspect a lot of footage ended up on the cutting room floor in order to make the film move along faster because some of the interactions between characters don't carry much weight. You'd think McCleod would be on edge with his wife and kids on the boat, but he looks like he's ready for a nap. Too, the relationship between Bannister and Brunel seems superficial and doesn't add anything to the plot. Perhaps the greatest sin committed by Lester's movie involves what I call Annoying Kid Syndrome. I kept waiting for someone to strap McCleod's offspring to one of the bombs, or at least throw them overboard. These two are like fingernails on a chalkboard! But the tension works at times, Harris hams it up every chance he gets, and the ending is riveting despite being a clich. MGM saw fit to give us "Juggernaut" with a trailer as the only extra, sad to say, but the picture quality looks very sharp. It's letterboxed, too. If you're a nut for these types of movies--the disaster movies of the 1970s, that is--I say give this one a shot. I'm struggling about how many stars I should give the movie. "Juggernaut" hovers somewhere between three and four due to the problems cited above, but the fact that it redeems itself at the end should count for something. Most importantly, it lacks the utter ridiculousness of many of Irwin Allen's destruction epics. Let's round up and say four for the overall effort. It's a good way to spend a couple of hours.  
I'M THE BIGGEST FAN OF THIS MOVIE IN THE WHOLE WORLD ,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS FILM,GREAT ACTORS,I LOVE THE MANIAC PERFORMED BY FREDDIE JONES AND THE EXPLOSIVES SQUAD TOO WITH A WONDERFUL,INCREDIBLE,AWESOME,UNFORGETTABLE RICHARD HARRIS AS THE HEAD OF THE TEAM,WITHOUT DISREGARDING THE LIKES OF ANTHONY HOPKINS OMAR SHERIFF,IAN HOLM...JUGGERNAUT I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU!!!I'LL LIVE FOREVER IN THE BRITANNIC AND I COULD SWEAR I'M LISTENING THE EXPLOSIONS...IS IT THE BLUE WIRE OR THE RED ONE ? I WANT THAT DVD NOW !! 
With the ever present ticking of a clock and nerve-wracking machine noises in the soundtrack, this is a taut, nifty disaster thriller, with the cruise ship HMS Britannic sailing to America, unknowingly with 7 bombs hidden aboard, set to explode; they have multiple booby traps, and the saboteur wants not only money but revenge against the system that in his twisted mind feels slighted him. The cast is great, with Richard Harris as the head of a demolition team, David Hemmings as his right-hand man, Omar Sharif as the ship's captain, and Anthony Hopkins as the man in charge of finding the bad guy (whose wife and children are aboard the ship); Shirley Knight, Ian Holm, and Roy Kinnear round out the cast. The direction by Richard Lester, better known for his comedic musical films with The Beatles and not thrillers, is fast paced, with some superb effects; I especially like the suspenseful moments when the demolition crew arrives on the scene, parachuting into the stormy sea. The screenplay by producer Richard DeKoker is intelligent, raising this film up from the average production in this genre, and the cinematography by Gerry Fisher excellent. The score by Ken Thorne is also good, but mostly one can only hear the tick...tick...tick...of the bomb. Total running time is 109 minutes. 
It's all there...drama, action, and suspense. This movie will keep you glued to your seat with all its twists and turns. And Morgan Freeman is a bonus. If a movie has Morgan Freeman in it, then 9 times out of 10 it will be an awesome movie. This is no exception...Great movie. 
Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross...Doesn't get much better than that. Monica Potter ...well, look up cute in the dictionary..Her picture is there. Anyway, this had some serious plot twists that somehow all seemed to make sense as they got tied together. Morgan Freeman continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors in film today. 
I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross. Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike. Not even close. Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel. Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of "Dallas". As with most books made into movies, something is missing. I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book. All that said, I did enjoy the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained 
I could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that I'm smarter than you but that's pretty much a waste of my time and yours. I like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches, to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it's comprised of. The story line has interesting twists, it has actors in it I like. So I give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because I get to watch Morgan Freeman act and Monica Potter be cute as hell (I just REALLY REALLY wish she could act but cute will do). Not a bad way to spend an hour or two 
By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider 
This was a great movie. Kept me in suspense. Buy it. 
It's hard to keep up with when you first start out, but all 3 workouts are great you can go at your own pace. I'd definitely recommend it. I do one 12 minute workout each day after doing some aerobic exercises, I started seeing a difference after just a few weeks 
i really like this tape. the workout is challenging but well paced and after nearly two weeks i am definitely seeing results in my biggest problem area: the ABS! my one peeve is that the audio seems a bit muffled but that could be this particular copy of the tape, but its just at the beginning and clears itself up right away 
I have only used the ab portion of this video, but the results are great and quick. I do not have the flattest belly, but when I use this I can see a huge difference within a week or two. The best part is that you only need to really do it 3 times a week, minimum. The reason I think it works is because, though it is only 12 minutes, it's 12 minutes non-stop ab work. As soon as you start saying ouch she moves onto the next exercise. I've lost my original copy so I just ordered a new one........I'm so glad it's still in print. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
Yeah! I am so excited to find that this video is still available. I worked out to this video every afternoon in high school and it was really and truly my favorite workout tape. Unfortunately, my VCR ate the tape a few years back and I have been unable to find another copy. Now that I have finally located another copy, I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this one and putting it back into rotation.I really like Kathy's attitude. She is encouraging without being too perky, and she emphasizes proper form. Also, Kathy suggests that you work up to all the reps (valuable advice in this case). Some of the other folks in this video are dowmright goofy, but this can be a good thing if you enjoy making fun of others during your regular workout, as I do (I find the male excercisers in this one particularly hilarious for some reason). Oh, yeah, one more thing. After your first few workouts with this one, you will probably be wanting to dog-cuss Kathy to the ends of the earth - it's a toughie, especially the ab section. BUT, stick with it, because I swear it's effective. Once you master all the movements, you can actually FEEL yourself getting stronger and yes, much more toned and sexy. You will come to crave your time with Kathy, and on your days off you will miss the sight of that old guy (who I'm sure will crack you up, too) 
Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie: puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)? Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)? What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)? Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad. Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy. Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease. In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind. Isn't that what movie making is all about? 
This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country? I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc. I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please. Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died. I kept expecting someone to call Social Services. And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children. And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all. Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
"In America" takes hold of you right from the beginning,squeezes your heart, and never lets go. A poor family enters this Country illegally, with dreams of a better life for thier family (A young Mother and Father, and thier 2 young daughters) They move smack in the middle of Brooklyn in the middle of an unbearably hot summer. We experience just about every human emotion there is as this story unfolds, and what a wonderful story it is! We see this masterpiece through the eyes (and camera) of the 11 year old girl. We go through all this poor Irish family's trials and tribulations with them,(many of them pure heartbreak) and come out REFRESHED. I think it is the simplicity of the story, and the innocence of this poor family that is so ... FRESH. We experience what the word "poor" truely means.We feel thier loss (the death of a third child) they are still going through, and in short, We fall head over heels in love with this family. We also meet one of thier neighbors that the girls befriend, who is dying,They pull him out of his deep depression at the end of his life, and the family shows him thier love, and offer him lifes greatest gift, thier friendship. Yet we still ache for him, and the smallest child especially when the end comes for him. We do get to experience some joy in his death though, that he got to know the true pure innocent love of this wonderful family before he dies. This movie is a must see, and one of the 10 best I have EVER seen. True, it is a tear jerker, but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more. 
`In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved. The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new. The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah Emma Bolger). Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition. Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect. In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light. That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend. It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states. No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed. As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some. They need each other. The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow. This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness. As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life. This is due mostly to the impressive cast. Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here. I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette. Regardless, her performance was harrowing. She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping. Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season. He was brilliant and deserved some recognition. His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping. And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting. They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow! This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone. It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that. 
In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope. The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs. The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks. Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing. 
Many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the United States. To this, I respond: We've seen that hundreds of times in films. The same goes for sports films. We've seen the movie Glory Road in other films like Coach Carter, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers. They are exactly the same movie with a different team. That's not to say that these films aren't decent sports flicks, but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genre. That being said, that is exactly what Jim Sheridan does with In America. The story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph. The basic story follows a family of Irish immigrants who come to America with the same notion that all immigrants have: to attain the American Dream. But, as they all sooner or later find out, the American Dream is an ideology that 99.9% of people never attain. They have trouble finding a place to stay, and end up with an apartment at the top of a run down building with many of its residents being junkies. The father Johnny (Paddy Considine) is a struggling actor, who hasn't been able to get a part since the death of his son Frankie, who fell down the stairs. The mother Sarah (Samantha Morton) takes a job at an ice cream parlor to earn the rent money. The oldest daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger) is probably one of the smarter people in the film, and Sarah Bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl. She is the stereotype of the oldest child who is forced to grow up too soon. Her younger sister Ariel (played by Sarah Bolger's younger sister Emma) is the typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions about everything. There are some really touching scenes throughout the course of the film, one especially comes to mind, where the father almost squanders away all of the family's money trying to win an E.T. doll for the youngest daughter. There are essentially three miracles in the film, and Christy, who is also the narrator, relates these three events to a set of three wishes that her brother Frankie told her about before he died. The other great scenes in the film involve the family and their relationship to the man on one of the floors below. When they first arrive in the house, Christy calls him "the man who screams." This man's name is Mateo (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou) and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems. He is sort of the figure of "morality" in the film, often giving out endless amounts of advice. Mateo has some sort of disease (we can only expect that it is probably a venerial disease) and he gets sick throughout the movie. In America features one of the best ensembles I have ever seen. Every actor is perfect in every scene. Djimon Hounsou and Paddy Considine give the best performances in the entire film, and Jim Sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film. While I do agree with one other reviewer about how Christy has a modern camera in a story set in the eighties, stupid facts like these should not detract from the overall message of the film. The overall message, then, is not just about how immigrants face hardships when they come to America; we already know that from previous films and/or experiences. The film has such a deeper message, relating not just to immigrants, but to every person who watches this film. I really do not want to give the message away, but rather I will leave it up to you to go rent or buy this treasure of a film. This is truly one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen 
Human drama and feelings, disregard for stereotypes, great photography, action with reaction and great lesson in self acceptance is but a few of the elements that makes this a great classic. Made me think of my social role and position in life just like Crash did 
In the old days this movie would have been called a "chick flick". Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC. The family consists of a husband and wife with two young daughters who are trying to make it in America as poor Irish emigrants. Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother. One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years 
This is a lovely film; happy and sad. "Do you believe in magic?" Magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love, friendship, perserverance, and the optimism of young hearts. Sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth 
I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
I love John Grisham books, and though I've not read the Rainmaker, I do thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a David and Goliath story about an underprivileged family and a greener than grass lawyer taking on the mega-insurance company. (And believe it or not, I work for an insurance company!) The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film. The subplot of Rudy's love interest is a bit more than the movie really needs...I'd be interested to see if that portion exists or how it plays out in the book. Overall though, if you're looking for a nice solid movie, I'd recommend this one 
I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody 
Pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of John Grisham and bring it all onto the screen. They do a pretty good job. Matt Damon plays Rudy, a student in law school who's smart, broke, and about to make history. In the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer. The policy covered it but they would just not pay. Meantime Damons character is in deeper than ever, as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out. Read the novel, then watch the movie. It's really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving. Danny DeVito plays Damons partner in the film and it's one of the better roles I've seen him play. 
I loved this movie. Matt Damon, Clare Danes, Danny DeVito and especially Teresa Wright, give great performances 
It's a good story- it keeps the pace moving, and inserts nice little scenes of humor. And the best part? It's so close to the actual book. 
This is a great movie! Matt Damon is so great in this part of a Southern Lawyer starting out, and Mickey Rourke and Danny Devito are perfectly cast as the supporting partners to Matt's role. I love this movie and have already watched it over and over. A must see. 
This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Read the book if you want the backstory since the screenplay starts at the half point. It's entertaining and that's why we see movies in the first place, right? Matt Damon is just so darn likeable, you get drawn into his narration right off the bat. The screenplay was very well done. It IS a Coppola film, after all...he does work with some talented people. It was very nice to see Theresa Wright in this film, as well. 
I wasn't expecting much when I dropped this 1998 movie into the DVD player... There is a lot to commend itself. Matt Damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam! Danny Devito is slimy, shady, sarcastic, and sleazy (in other words, perfect Devito) as Damon's partner. The main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia. The sleazy Big Insurance Company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter. They bet wrong! Our hero, guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge (Dixon from Alias), come to the rescue. The pieces fit together quite nicely. Justice is served, bad guys are taken down, and Matt Damon establishes himself as an unlikely, unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process. Nothing wrong with this story or this film. Very delightful and satisfying in every respect. 
This is one of the greatest musicals of all time. The songs all became well-loved hits, and are known to music lovers of all ages, even today. Frank Sinatra, Shirley Maclaine, Louis Jourdain Maurice Chevalier got together to create a magical light love story, with fabulous singing and some good dance. The "I Love Paris" ballet is one of the classic dances of the screen, surpassed in my opinion only by Astaire-Rogers in Top Hat, the final ballet in American in Paris, John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing. The story line does wear a bit thin, with a somewhat silly ending in the cafe (movies made at that time sometimes suffered from this failing), but overall, this is still a classic. Why, oh why, is it not on DVD???? 
Can Can was the film that launched to overseas stages to Shirley Mac Laine one of the ten American actresses ever born. Based in the famous musical of Cole Porter of 1890s , this lackluster version involves to Frank Sinatra as the lawyer who will defend the rights of Miss Mac Laine to perform the daring dance in her nightclub. But the presence of the giants of the French song - Maurice Chevalier - and Louis Jordan makes of this musical a stand out musical still reminded after all these years. 
I currently own this VHS version. But I would buy the DVD in a heartbeat if it were available. And of course wide screen please. With commentary if possible. This movie and Gigi are both among my favorites 
I have to say that I rmember seeing Can-Can in its origional roadshow presentation in Los Angeles in my younger days. It was a great time at the movies, and I remember the scope of the widescreen and all those Can-Can dancers. I hope that we will soon see a DVD with the fully restored format in Letterbox, With Ovature and Intermission etc. While not the best musical every filmed I remember it fondly and would like to see a DVD that presents this move as it should be seen. Widescreen format, stero sound et al 
It's all there...drama, action, and suspense. This movie will keep you glued to your seat with all its twists and turns. And Morgan Freeman is a bonus. If a movie has Morgan Freeman in it, then 9 times out of 10 it will be an awesome movie. This is no exception...Great movie. 
Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross...Doesn't get much better than that. Monica Potter ...well, look up cute in the dictionary..Her picture is there. Anyway, this had some serious plot twists that somehow all seemed to make sense as they got tied together. Morgan Freeman continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors in film today. 
I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross. Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike. Not even close. Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel. Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of "Dallas". As with most books made into movies, something is missing. I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book. All that said, I did enjoy the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained 
I could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that I'm smarter than you but that's pretty much a waste of my time and yours. I like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches, to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it's comprised of. The story line has interesting twists, it has actors in it I like. So I give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because I get to watch Morgan Freeman act and Monica Potter be cute as hell (I just REALLY REALLY wish she could act but cute will do). Not a bad way to spend an hour or two 
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider 
This was a great movie. Kept me in suspense. Buy it. 
I came to this film with the attitude of enjoying a bit of ridiculous 'camp'. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman sporting Nawlins accents? I couldn't pass that up. Well, even with the right attitude coming in, it was at times painful. Emma's dialect coach should have been shot; Alan did better, at least he sounded like he was aiming at a southern accent, but he tends to drawl a bit anyhow so maybe it was easier for him. However, Emma and Alan are only supporting characters. The main characters are not terrible or anything, but really not that compelling. Oh, the plot. The film does have a good plot, and it could have been interesting, but nonetheless I found it a bit plodding. And as others, have noted, the editting is so weak it's comical. Oh actually there is a quite memorable scene: the cunnilingus scene in a meat locker. Wow, that was...um...unusual. Well, Emma and Alan fans will no doubt watch it, but save it for a slow mid-week night. Actually, any Emma fans with a sense of humor should definitely watch this at some point. Emma is obviously having a good time, and seeing her dangle a cigarette while tailing on roller blades is something else. It just you might not want to choose this as a film to watch with friends, unless you want to expose the depths to which you will descend to watch Emma or Alan on the screen. Addendum: Alan plays a good character here. It's a nice lite break if you've been working through his films where he often plays morally ambiguous (or not so ambiguous) characters in films that explore difficult themes 
The concept of this film is downright brilliant--a maze of betrayal and corruption and kidnapping-gone-wrong...or did it? It's too bad that the script and/or the editing is so sloppy and choppy that I frequently found myself wincing at such poor filmmaking. The gratuitous sex might be a turn-on for some (it wasn't for me), but the only really worthwhile aspects of this movie are the idea itself and the actors, who have gifted this writer/director with far better performances than he deserves. If you're a fan of any of the actors, you might watch it if you have nothing better to do. Otherwise, skip it 
I found this movie to be utterly hilarious! It's a bit wierd but that's what makes it stand out from the others. I think each character was unique making the movie that much better! I give it 'two thumbs up 
ITS YOUR CLASSIC BAD GUY GOOD GUY - GOOD GUY SAVES GIRL. THE major thumbs down about this movie was the "room mates" and the excess use of gutter language at times. What makes this a GOOD movie though is its realistic presentation of issues. I find that the honesty between the characters personalities drove the storyline and made for an overall interesting movie with a sarcastic overtone about the worlds rejection of truth, purity and innocence, both displayed in the Professer and the "room mates".Also worthy of note is the confusion the misplaced "MAIDEN IN DISTRESS" suffers from.Which leaves the masculine viewer completly relating to the "Loser" who is clearly the hero of the story. This would be a good movie to preach from. Leaving out comments made in the movie for SURE but by mainly pointing out the situations and CONSEQUENCES of substance abuse,the possible compromises that can be made all in the name of the $, amoung other youth issues also portrayed in the movie. IF ANYTHING enjoy the movie, recieve its warm humor and FEEL driven to support the under dog or all round nice guy next time you meet one. WILD AT HEART indeed! GS 
Loser is by far one of my favorite movies. I remember that there were only 3 other people in the theater when I saw it, though. I definitly does not get the attention it deserves. It's a cute story about a small town boy who moves to the big city, and he falls for the independent girl on the way. The movie is rather predictible as most teen movies are, but it a really funny and cute look at college life in NYC 
I will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot. The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this. If you like it the first time you see it, then proceed to buy it, because you always will. If you're not keen on it, then don't bother 
But I'm a Cheerleader~ Natasha Lyonne is a good movie that could have been so much better. Natasha Lyonne is perfect in the role as Megan. Megan is a cheerleader, has a boyfriend but she does not like to kiss him, has girls in her locker and thinks of girls all the time. Her "friends" and family decide that it is time for an intervention and send her away to a camp to turn her straight. The music is pretty awful and most of the lyrics seem to have been written in five minutes or by a high school rock band. I truly is the music that prevents me from giving this movie a 5 out of 5. The script is well written with well developed characters and a plot that is truly outstanding. The dialog is a hoot and there are many witty and good one liners. This is one good movie that could have easily attained 5 stars with the right soundtrack but as it is I give it 4 out of 5 stars. 
I have seen the other reviews and agree with them in the main. This movie is absolutely worth the cost. When you have read and know the incredible pain visited on children by institutions like this, it is good to be told in a humorous way of the pain visited upon these children. It is definitely worth seeing especially after reading about these torture camps. If it evens open the eyes of one parent or caregiver, it will have been worth it. As satire and humor alone, it is admirably worth it 
This movie, I have seen back when it came out, and I loved it! I watched in alomost everyday, and vnever got tired of it! I saw it again and loved it like the first time I watched it. Light, and cute! Keeps my mind happy, and entertained! I definetly suggest anyone to watch this movie. Especially if you feel misunderstood or out of place, this movie will pick you up, and show you that you are not alone. Greta sattire 
This underrated, highly entertaining satire boasts memorable performances, clever camera angles and a spirited production design. Look for a red-headed, scene-stealing Douglas Spain (Walkout, Band of Brothers, Resurrection Blvd) as one of gone-with-the-gays True Directions' "misfits." His climactic tearful speech is both touching and hilarious. Pop the corn, kick back and treat yourself to this delightful romp 
this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me. this has happened about 4/5 times. While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do. sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work. If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
When I was looking at this movie from the gay and lesbian list of films on border I didn't really think I would like it since I'm a gay male and couldn't possibly like anything that had to do with lesbians. Let me tell you I was wrong. I feel ashamed to even say that I couldn't like this movie. Let me explain the movie to you and you see if you wouldn't like it. We start off with Natasha Lyonn playing the character Megan Bloomfield. A cheerleader who is popular, kind, and the girlfriend of the star quaterback in highschool. We see that she doesn't really like to kiss her boyfriend and her family at dinner prays to make things just the way god intended them to be. After school her family, some of her friends and her boyfriend meet her at her house for an intervention. They claim that they fear she is a lesbian. Proving it with evidence of girls picture in her locker, gay memoribilia in her room, she's a vegetarian and the biggest one of all that she doesn't like to kiss her boyfriend. After that she is taken to a sexual redirection camp run by Mary J. Brown played by Cathy Moriarty with her staff RuPaul playing the character Mike who is an Ex gay and her son Rock played by Eddie Cibrian who isnt so manly himself. Where queer boys learn how to be men and Dikey girls learn how to become happy homemakers. (sorry for the rude example). This is where she meets Clea DuVall playing the character Graham Eaton. Seeming like the tough lesbian girl who will never surrender herself to the school. Unfortunately Graham has problems of her own when we discover that she will not be aloud back home, no car and no trust fund if she does not succeed this task. The girls ultimately become friends and attracted to each other. They even have a kiss session when they are rescued from Richard Molls character Larry Morgan-Gordon and his lover Wesley Manns character Lloyd Morgan-Gordon. The training sessions are funny to watch especially with the men. I don't want to ruin any more of the movie for you. If you haven't seen this then you should. I hope this review will get you to watch it 
It's actually not just a light-hearted silly comedy-- as my ex pointed out to me "Did you ever notice how only the gay characters wear any color?" Everything is brown and drab green but the clothes and surroundings of the queer characters 
This is funniest and light-hearted comdey that is not overly cheesy or degrading. Its cute, charming and watchable. Just a typical love story that involves gay and lesbian charachters. Nothing too serious is laid out, but it doesnt take away from the film. One of the sincerist gay comedies ever made 
This video is the only reason that I was ever able to memorize the Preamble. In American History I had to say it for a grade and it was hard to keep from singing it! I'm in AP US History now and believe me, I never thought that I'd watch this video to help review for a test (but I did, and I got an A on the test). Besides that, History Rock has a lot of infectious tunes that never become annoying and are thoroughly educational. "Elbow Room", "I'm Just A Bill", "Mother Necessity" and "Melting Pot" are just a few of the several songs that cover topics like the formation of the colonies, how a bill becomes a law, inventions such as the cotton gin, and the USA's immigrant heritage. It's basically a fun, musical overview of all the things everyone should know about US history. This is a must have 
this movie is a gem for B-movie aficianados. It's got a decent amount of gore, some pretty funny scenes, a couple scenes which will make you jump, and a dash of Elephant Man-type emotion. I really like this movie, but if your one of those people who expect Hollywood class acting and special effects, then you might not like this movie. but for us b-movie lovers, this movie is great and i would highly recommend buying it 
As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action 
I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
"Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it 
Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Ann Miller, Tommy Roll, Bob Fosse, Carol Haney, Keenan Wynn, James Whitmore, and music by Cole Porter. "nuff said. Brush up your Shakespeare!!! 
This is one of my favourite musicals (along with Seven Brides for SEven brothers). A great good natured movie which followed a hugely successful Broadway show of the same name. Cole Porter's amusing songs set on the background of a stage musical based around Shakespeare's taming of the shrew. In the background are the ex husband and wife (Fred and Lilli - played by Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel) who are reliving their own version of Katherine and Petruchio as they figure out their own failed marriage This is not a difficult film to watch emotionally, as you can imagine Cole Porter is not Oprah Wingrey. However it is enormoulsy good natured, I love Porter's clever lyrics and Howard Keel and Grayson are extremely good in their roles, A neat supporting cast. There are a few stretches in some of the songs - I mean how on earth could they really imagine that 'Wunderbar' would be a great song for a shakespearian play set in Italy? Still it fits in and it is fun to watch just how they manage it - and as for teh two gangsters singing, 'Brush up your Shakespeare' rhyming Heinous with Coriolanus! There are really no extras on this at all - if you hoped for an interview or deleted scenes then forget it, it is the movie, and a few picture scenes with a bit of information on them, nothing that you would want to buy this DVD especially for. One of the best musicals, lots of fun and a good watch 
Some of the re-writes for this movie are a bit hard to take. While the new opening is a little hard to take, it does establish the animosity between Fred and Lily quite well. It also makes "Too darned hot" acceptable. Censored lyrics are not awful, but they rob Porter of some of his depth. Katherine Grayson rises to the occasion quite well. Her early scene is contrived, but after that she's on firm footing. Howard Keel is wonderful. His acting is just a tad square, but that was in part the format of the time. Ann Miller dances up a storm. And, speaking of dancing, what a treat to have Carol Haney, Bob Fosse and Bobby Van as featured dancers. There isn't really a complete rendition of "Another openin', another show" and "Bianca" is cut entirely. But the rest of the numbers come through great. Why 4 stars? Partially because of the cuts. But also the color has just a little fluctuation at times. This isn't a restored print, but it isn't bad either. I wish they had a few more of the 3-D excerpts in the Special stuff. I also with they sent some 3-D glasses. 
I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall). Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film. Then I noticed the cover. I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'. YIKES! It is! I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!). If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it. Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
When two squabbling ex-marrieds are cast as squabbling Renanaissance romantics in a musical "The Taming Of the Sherew 1952" , life imitates art , art imitates life -and it all proves no musical comedy imitates KISS ME KATE , the backstage / onstage delight from the 1948 Broadway smash and featuring 14 peerles Cole Porter (1891-1964) songs . Howard Keel (1919-2004) and Kathryn Grayson (1922- ) are the tangeled twosome So in Love despite her i hate men flashpoints . Ann Miller (1923-2003) adds heat , razzle-tap-dazzling .Zesty Choreography by Bob Foss (1927-1987) and Hermes Pan (1909-1990) Under George Sidney (1916-2002) nible direction . So brush up your Shakespeare and Enjoy . Kaste wont just Kiss you . Shell floor you !. DVD includes vintage documentary shorts : Mighty Manhattan and New Yorks Wonder city , the pure digital transfer in high resolution and enjoy both movies . Highly recommende 
Directed by George Sidney with all the color and verve befitting a top-shelf MGM production, "Kate" re-teamed Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson after their successful turn together in the studio's Technicolor re-make of "Showboat" (1951). The pair never hit a false note playing off each other, with Keel's manly bearing and baritone complementing Grayson's feminine but fiery persona and expressive soprano voice. With its ingenious story of romantic shenanigans on and off the stage, "Kiss Me Kate" remains irresistible entertainment 
I'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand - you receive one of the greatest MGM musicals ever conceived and it's bolstered by quite nice extras. That much you can be assured of. I'm writing this particular review because of Warner Bros. insistance on using fragile, cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases. The problem with these Warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case, rendering it's capability the actually hold the disc useless. And unlike the plastic cases, the Warner ones cannot be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer (good luck with that, by the way). Another problem lies with the fact that it's made out of cardboard - when you remove the anti-theft stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover. This can occur even when you're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off. The reason I feel the need to mention this is I own dozens of Warner movies, and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one (not likely, Greedy Bros.) To be fair, Warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases - the top-notch Film Noir and Gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases. But titles like "Kiss Me Kate", "Rebel Without A Cause", "Broadway Melody of 1940", and even "Wizard of Oz" are still only available in these sad cardboard cases. 
This is by far one of the very best musicals ever made. Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel displays Oscar worthy performances as Lilli and Fred. Sadly, this was Grayson`s last MGM film and she did only 1 more(at Paramount - The Vagabond King with Oreste). In KISS ME KATE she shows us a depth and nuance and is right on target the whole picture through. Audrey Hepburn won that year`s Oscar for Roman Holiday - but Miss Grayson should deservedly have won it. The same goes for Howard Keel. True, he is hammy at times - but it is a remarkable performance he gives(Mind u - he was a musical star). William Wolden`s Oscar for Stalag 17 should have gone to Mr Keel. That`s Entertainment and its sequels payed deservedly homage to producer Arthur Freed and his genius in selecting and delegating crew and performers to the right project were uncanny. Yet you shouldn`t negletct Jack Cummings who produced this film, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers and Three Little Words(to name but a few). It seems to me that MGM had an "MGM-look!" Can u really tell the MGM films from 1930-1960 apart and say which 1 was the director? Not really, unless u are Hitchcock or Fritz Lang. What I mean to say that it`s high time Cummings, Joe Pasternak og Sol C. Sigel comes out of the cold and are giving honours for their splendid musical efforts(Bathing Beauty, Anchors Aweigh, In the Good Old Summertime, Summer Stock, The Great Caruso, Hit The Deck and High Society etc). I must also pay may respects to Tommy Rall(soon 2 be one of the brothers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers); he is a dancer`s dream come true:- 
I really love this video. Ann Smith is such an inspiration in showing that just because a person is middle aged or older doesn't mean they can't still be flexible. I do this video every morning when I first get up. It only takes 3 minutes a day and it helps me get all those little "kinks" out. Well worth the time 
Physical fitness is not just for the young and beautiful as Ann Smith ably demonstrates to her video audience. She performs each of the seven stretches with enviable grace and flexibility. I told my spouse, If that old woman can do it, then so can I; he thought that would be a good name for the tape! Ann demonstrates each exercise twice - the first time she provides a voiceover describing what you're doing; the second time you do the same exact exercise (the same clip is shown twice) with no verbal cuing. I would like her to talk a little more about form as you're doing the exercises; visual imagery helps me figure out what I'm supposed to be doing and whether I'm doing it right or not. I also wish she would talk you through the second time as well, because when I'm twisting away from the screen or hanging down my head, I can't see what she's doing, and I either fall behind her or worry that I will. Even though these are very short stretch exercises meant to be done each morning, it also works to combine them all for a nice 20-minute stretch. And it feels great

I really enjoyed this video. I am very sluggish in the mornings and don't really have the time for a full workout because of my hectic schedule. What was so appealing to me about this video was that there was a short segment for each morning that I could find time to complete before rushing out the door. It gives me the extra pick-up that I need before a long day at work. Also, I really liked the fact that I didn't need to rewind the tape after I was finished with my segment for the day. I thought the concept behind the video was very clever and perfect for my lifestyle. Thanks Ann 
I have been using this tape for about 6 weeks and am very pleased with the results already! I have never been a regular exerciser and at 52 feel the consequences-- these simple stretches are easy to do, make me feel graceful and awake and have already made me more flexibile. I highly recommend this tape for a little out of shape, maybe a little older people who don't have much time for exercise. I use some of the stretches during the day after sitting at my computer for a long time -- it feels great

This is one of my favourite musicals (along with Seven Brides for SEven brothers). A great good natured movie which followed a hugely successful Broadway show of the same name. Cole Porter's amusing songs set on the background of a stage musical based around Shakespeare's taming of the shrew. In the background are the ex husband and wife (Fred and Lilli - played by Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel) who are reliving their own version of Katherine and Petruchio as they figure out their own failed marriage This is not a difficult film to watch emotionally, as you can imagine Cole Porter is not Oprah Wingrey. However it is enormoulsy good natured, I love Porter's clever lyrics and Howard Keel and Grayson are extremely good in their roles, A neat supporting cast. There are a few stretches in some of the songs - I mean how on earth could they really imagine that 'Wunderbar' would be a great song for a shakespearian play set in Italy? Still it fits in and it is fun to watch just how they manage it - and as for teh two gangsters singing, 'Brush up your Shakespeare' rhyming Heinous with Coriolanus! There are really no extras on this at all - if you hoped for an interview or deleted scenes then forget it, it is the movie, and a few picture scenes with a bit of information on them, nothing that you would want to buy this DVD especially for. One of the best musicals, lots of fun and a good watch 
Some of the re-writes for this movie are a bit hard to take. While the new opening is a little hard to take, it does establish the animosity between Fred and Lily quite well. It also makes "Too darned hot" acceptable. Censored lyrics are not awful, but they rob Porter of some of his depth. Katherine Grayson rises to the occasion quite well. Her early scene is contrived, but after that she's on firm footing. Howard Keel is wonderful. His acting is just a tad square, but that was in part the format of the time. Ann Miller dances up a storm. And, speaking of dancing, what a treat to have Carol Haney, Bob Fosse and Bobby Van as featured dancers. There isn't really a complete rendition of "Another openin', another show" and "Bianca" is cut entirely. But the rest of the numbers come through great. Why 4 stars? Partially because of the cuts. But also the color has just a little fluctuation at times. This isn't a restored print, but it isn't bad either. I wish they had a few more of the 3-D excerpts in the Special stuff. I also with they sent some 3-D glasses. 
I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall). Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film. Then I noticed the cover. I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'. YIKES! It is! I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!). If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it. Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
When two squabbling ex-marrieds are cast as squabbling Renanaissance romantics in a musical "The Taming Of the Sherew 1952" , life imitates art , art imitates life -and it all proves no musical comedy imitates KISS ME KATE , the backstage / onstage delight from the 1948 Broadway smash and featuring 14 peerles Cole Porter (1891-1964) songs .

So brush up your Shakespeare and Enjoy . Kaste wont just Kiss you . Shell floor you !. DVD includes vintage documentary shorts : Mighty Manhattan and New Yorks Wonder city , the pure digital transfer in high resolution and enjoy both movies . Highly recommende 
Directed by George Sidney with all the color and verve befitting a top-shelf MGM production, "Kate" re-teamed Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson after their successful turn together in the studio's Technicolor re-make of "Showboat" (1951). The pair never hit a false note playing off each other, with Keel's manly bearing and baritone complementing Grayson's feminine but fiery persona and expressive soprano voice. With its ingenious story of romantic shenanigans on and off the stage, "Kiss Me Kate" remains irresistible entertainment 
I'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand - you receive one of the greatest MGM musicals ever conceived and it's bolstered by quite nice extras. That much you can be assured of. I'm writing this particular review because of Warner Bros. insistance on using fragile, cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases. The problem with these Warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case, rendering it's capability the actually hold the disc useless. And unlike the plastic cases, the Warner ones cannot be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer (good luck with that, by the way). Another problem lies with the fact that it's made out of cardboard - when you remove the anti-theft stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover. This can occur even when you're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off. The reason I feel the need to mention this is I own dozens of Warner movies, and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one (not likely, Greedy Bros.) To be fair, Warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases - the top-notch Film Noir and Gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases. But titles like "Kiss Me Kate", "Rebel Without A Cause", "Broadway Melody of 1940", and even "Wizard of Oz" are still only available in these sad cardboard cases. 
This is by far one of the very best musicals ever made. Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel displays Oscar worthy performances as Lilli and Fred. Sadly, this was Grayson`s last MGM film and she did only 1 more(at Paramount - The Vagabond King with Oreste). In KISS ME KATE she shows us a depth and nuance and is right on target the whole picture through. Audrey Hepburn won that year`s Oscar for Roman Holiday - but Miss Grayson should deservedly have won it. The same goes for Howard Keel. True, he is hammy at times - but it is a remarkable performance he gives(Mind u - he was a musical star). William Wolden`s Oscar for Stalag 17 should have gone to Mr Keel. That`s Entertainment and its sequels payed deservedly homage to producer Arthur Freed and his genius in selecting and delegating crew and performers to the right project were uncanny. Yet you shouldn`t negletct Jack Cummings who produced this film, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers and Three Little Words(to name but a few). It seems to me that MGM had an "MGM-look!" Can u really tell the MGM films from 1930-1960 apart and say which 1 was the director? Not really, unless u are Hitchcock or Fritz Lang. What I mean to say that it`s high time Cummings, Joe Pasternak og Sol C. Sigel comes out of the cold and are giving honours for their splendid musical efforts(Bathing Beauty, Anchors Aweigh, In the Good Old Summertime, Summer Stock, The Great Caruso, Hit The Deck and High Society etc). I must also pay may respects to Tommy Rall(soon 2 be one of the brothers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers); he is a dancer`s dream come true:- 
It's all there...drama, action, and suspense. This movie will keep you glued to your seat with all its twists and turns. And Morgan Freeman is a bonus. If a movie has Morgan Freeman in it, then 9 times out of 10 it will be an awesome movie. This is no exception...Great movie. 
Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross...Doesn't get much better than that. Monica Potter ...well, look up cute in the dictionary..Her picture is there. Anyway, this had some serious plot twists that somehow all seemed to make sense as they got tied together. Morgan Freeman continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors in film today. 
I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross. Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike. Not even close. Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel. Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of "Dallas". As with most books made into movies, something is missing. I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book. All that said, I did enjoy the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained 
I could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that I'm smarter than you but that's pretty much a waste of my time and yours. I like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches, to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it's comprised of. The story line has interesting twists, it has actors in it I like. So I give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because I get to watch Morgan Freeman act and Monica Potter be cute as hell (I just REALLY REALLY wish she could act but cute will do). Not a bad way to spend an hour or two 
By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider 
This was a great movie. Kept me in suspense. Buy it. 
When my son was born, and only my singing seemed to comfort him, (my singing had never comforted anyone before...) I found myself singing "The Preamble" and "Conjunction Junction." I bought all four Schoolhouse Rock videos shortly afterwards.  He's three now, and this is his second favorite video.(after "Multiplication Rock")  He does, however, leave the room during "Busy Prepositions." I have no recollection of this one, and it doesn't measure up to the rest of the songs. I was surprised to find it was written by Bob Dorough, who wrote most of the others.  One miss, and eight hits should still warrant a five star rating. "Unpack Your Adjectives," "Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, Get Your Adverbs Here," "Conjunction Junction," "Interjections," "Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla," "Verb: That's What's Happening," "A Noun is a Person Place Or Thing," and the fabulous "The Tale of Mr. Morton" are all classics.    
As a kid, I loved the Schoolhouse Rock series and still remember the Grammar Rock songs. As a mom, I came across Schoolhouse Rock again by chance and thought I'd get the tapes for my kids who are now 2 and (nearly) 5 to enjoy when they're older. Amazingly, not only my Kindergartener but also my 2 year old prefer this tape to just about anything else right now - including the Wiggles and Blues Clues! I thought I'd bought these for the future, but they absolutely love the music and the animation and my 2-year old goes around singing snatches of "Interjections" and "Lolly Lolly Lolly get your Adverbs Here". As for my Kindergarten-age son, he has grown to enjoy it on a whole new level now that he is reading and beginning to learn grammar and punctuation concepts. Parents, it's never too soon to invest in this gem! I'd much rather have them watching this than the Rugrats or something.. 
I love this video! My mom bought it for me and my siblings when I was in second grade. I fell in love immediately. I still watch it just for old time's sake. The tunes are so catchy that I still remember all the words. For years, whenever I had a question on adverbs, for instance, the song from this video would come to mind. This is also partly why I got a 660 on the verbal section of my PSATs last year! If you buy this you'll never regret it 
This series pays of time after time after time. I watched the original series on T.V. as a child. I sang the preamble in order to pass in 7th grade,I passed English because I was able to "pull out my adjectives". Now, in the year 2000, My children are able to use these videos to enjoy learning. My 17 year old took it to her law and government class just last week. This is truly the best investment you will ever make. It combine learning with entertainment, and that isn't easy to do these days 
I'm one of those children of the 70s who still remembers "Grammar Rock, it's not your Gran'ma; it's your grammar" brought to us by "our very favorite general, General Foods" on Saturday morning tv. These "commercials" were better than the shows, and that's even more true today. I'm thrilled to be able to pass these gems on to my kindergartner and 2nd grader, who are mastering learning parts of speech in great part due to the time-honored technique of combining information with catchy tunes and visual images. I've found Grammar Rock to be the most useful of the Schoolhouse Rock series, but the other titles are excellent as well. My daughter's learning her times tables to the tune of "Three, It's A Magic Number"; and to this day I remember the preamble to the Constitution because of America Rock. Now if only someone with the same creative talents would add to the series...how about Geography Rock, Spelling Rock, etc.? 
My kids love all the School House Rock videos, and want to watch them all the time. Grammar Rock is wonderful, teaching kids the basics of grammar with fun and catchy tunes, and cartoons to get the information into the child's mind. Even my two year old enjoys watching the videos, and my four year old can verbally identify interjections, nouns, pro-nouns, and verbs after watching the tapes. This tape is great in helping kids understand and remember grammar, I often refer back to the songs if one of my older kids needs help remembering 
Some of what's on television is harmful to kids (and possibly adults), much of what's on television is neutral, and some of it is quite good. "Schoolhouse Rock" falls into a fourth category: stroke of genius. Catchy tunes, clear lyrics, and repetitive lessons are blended into memorable little pieces of educational fun that should never have stopped. If you want something on TV while the kids are getting ready for school, or when they're having an after-school snack, this is it. If teachers want quick, fun ways to introduce concepts, this is it. Television doesn't get better than this for kids 
This tape has given me a great waistline.On use this tape almost everyday along with the other 5-day abs tape from the Firm.There are 5 seperate ab workouts compiled from other great Firm workouts.Firm Cardio,Firm Stength,Better Body,Better Buns are just to name a few. I know since I have used this tape with my other visdeo my stomach has gotten toned.This tape is good for beginners and advanced.I guarantee you`ll love it 
This is a later version of the original Firm 5 day abs video, and the one I prefer. It contains clips of ab work from Better Body and Buns, Fat Blaster, Maximum Body Shaping, Firm Strength and Firm Cardio, in that order. Each routine runs about 5-6 minutes long and has a brief introduction before each clip. Some of the ab routines use light weights for resistance which is optional of course. My personal favorite is Day 2, from Fat Blaster, the music really fits the routine and it is fun as well as effective, at least I always feel it anyway. But all the routines are unique and interesting in their own way. My favorite Firm videos are from the "middle era", following the classic volumes 1-6 and preceding the BSS1, BSS2, BSS3 and BSS4 series. These are some of the best ab routines and I am glad that they are all available on one video. Firm and tone your abs every day of the week 
I haven't used this video in a while, but when I did, my abs were the flattest they've ever been. It's only a few minutes a day, but it is the toughest ab workout I have ever found. You might get the urge to scream out in pain, but it'll be worth it! 
I have done many different style of ab exercises, practically memorizing the most effective ones. This tape offered ab work I had not done before. It is tough but very good. I also liked the music selections. If you are a fitness enthusiast and really like the "burn" this is a great tape to have 
This video is not very good at all. I have been using the 8 Minute Abs video for a few weeks, and I have seen results already! I thought that I would add some variety to my routine by using a different video, but in choosing this video, I failed! The workouts are for those who squeeze in workouts during their lunch break without any time to shower. You will not break a sweat with this one 
I am 44 yrs old and my abs look great...I owe a lot of the way I look to the aray of Firm workout tapes that I've used off and on throughout the years...The "More 5-day Abs" video is great...The workouts are short but extremely effective...Everyday a different workout and each day a little more challenging than the day before....Because they only target the abs, the workouts are short and allows me to stay consistant even when I'm crunched for time...The longest one is only about 6 minutes long..I love this tape and highly recommend it to anyone who's serious about reshaping their abs but only have a short time available to do so...Definitely a wise investment.. 
I have the original 5-Day Abs by the Firm which is cut from videos from their Classics series (primarily from the 80s). Most of the classic Firms are great workouts, but somewhat dated, so the ab routines do not seem that innovative or interesting. But More 5-Day Abs has ab routines from the Firm's more recent videos, so you get to experience some really different routines that are not the typical boring gym class crunches. There is one routine in particular on day 3 with Tracie Long where you do obliques (muscle on the side of your abdomen) sitting on a chair that really works because I felt it the next day. This tape is a great resource if you want to add an ab routine every day to your fitness regime, whether you workout with videos or not. I would even recommend it over the original 5-Day Abs because it is so diverse and interesting. You will not be bored with this tape 
If you are looking to work those abs in the least time possible, then this video is for you. In less than 10 minutes a day you can get a complete ab workout -- upper, lower, as well as obliques. The video is made from spliced portions of other Firm workouts so you get 5 different instructors, just like in the original "5 Day Abs". Although this video seems a bit easier than the original, it still provides a tough ab workout and a nice change of pace. There is not much instruction during each segment on proper form so beginners may want to watch the segment first before they try some of the moves. If you can only get 1 ab video, I would buy the original "5 Day Abs" first, but this would be a good addition to your video library if you need a little something different to stay motivated 
Oh God, as a graduate of UAG I should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but I can't lie. The Madera's own the med. school.. the Leano's own the med. school. The Dean does not care about students.... Dean Villalobos and Martinez Sandoval dont care about the students. The infrastructure is a bit outdated.... you guessed it!! UAG's buildings are as old as Fenway without any upgrades. Oh yeah, the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous PMC program: "Programa Medicina en Comunidad", just like in the film!!!! It is a riot! If you plan to go to UAG you must watch this film. If you get a hold of it, bring it down to Guadalajara so you can laugh. 
This movie was so hilarious! I never saw it in the movie theater I don't believe. WAIT A SECOND! On second thought, I DID SEE IT in a movie theater. I thought it was funny though. The part where Guttenburg, Armstrong and the other intern, needed a cadaver (not sure on the spelling) for a grade, and they took a body from the morgue who the Central American police shot and killed. The man turned out to be a cousin of a taxi driver and it scares the bejesus out of him. And the other part is when Guttenburg and the doctor school secretary made out in the limousine and Gilbert Gottfried was looking at his reflection on the tinted windows but didn't see what was going on in the limo. Anyway, I hope that 20th Century Fox puts this out on DVD cause it is an absolute CLASSIC!!! See if you see in there Bill Macy (MAUDE) in there he plays the role of Jeffrey's father. Jeffrey played by Police Academy's Steve Guttenburg 
This film is hysterical. It has a plethora of quotable lines and is a great movie to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Alan Alda plays a sociopathic borderline dictator of a Dean of a Bannanna Republic Med School. Guttenberg doesnt...ruin the movie. All in all, if you like Real Genius and Spies Like Us, this movie will keep you on the floor laughing 
This is one of the best films I've seen to date and the cast is great. I recommend this film to everyone because it has a great story about a family whose getting by in the United States. 
The sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering. I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie. But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD 
I had to watch this in a college course i was taking. I enjoyed the movie. My Family/Mi Familia describes the tale of three generations of an immigrant family's troubles and achievements. Maria and Jose, the first generation, come to Los Angeles in the 1930's, meet and marry, and then they face deportation. They establish their family on the east side of Los Angeles, and their many children Chucho, Paco, Jimmy, Memo, Irene and Toni. This story starts with the father of the family, Jose Sanchez, who makes a one year journey on foot from Mexico to Los Angeles in order to track down his long lost brother. Once he gets there, he meets and marries the love of his life, Maria. The two of them begin a family and the stories of their children begin to develop. These stories involve Chucho who gets involved in gangs and has to deal with his father for his constant troubles with drugs and the police. Jimmy begins to follow in the footsteps of his older brother but eventually realizes that he needs to think about the future and that this way of life will not cut it. As the second generation become adults in the 60's, the focus of the story shifts to the son, Jimmy, and tells the story of his marriage to Isabel, their son, and Jimmy's journey to becoming a responsible parent. This story shows the life of a family that sticks together through adversities, through crime, gangs, prejudice, no matter what they are faced with, they will be a family. 
I looked at the length of the DVD and thought "this had better be good." It was. I am generally wary of family or individual biography movies, as in my experience, they tend to be episodic and lacking in the coherence of more conventional dramas -- by which I mean, they typically consist of a series of episodes but no clear plot line. That was less the case for this movie than for other family/individual dramas, perhaps because pretty much the same group of people were in the film throughout, and there was an overriding theme or point -- about the immigrant experience, particularly for Mexican-Americans. The story involves a young Mexican man, Jose, who is forced to leave the poverty of Mexico (in the late 20s?) to find family and work. He walks all the way to Los Angeles -- the border at this time is just a line in the ground, as he says -- where he has the name of someone who is possibly a relative. This man happily takes him in, and Jose gets a job as a landscaper working for wealthy Anglos. He falls in love, marries, and has a family. A series of tragedies and triumphs follow, involving this man, his wife, and each of their children. By the end of the movie, Jose is an old man, assessing his life as good. I would say that the theme of this movie is life in a Mexican-American family, reflecting both traditional values and customs as well as the problems of assimilation and cultural identity. Maybe it was just me, but I couldn't seem to get English subtitles to the Spanish to work. Consequently, there was some dialogue that I just guessed at, although most of the film was actually in English, although there was quite a bit of mumbling, so the ENglish subtitles helped. 
Actually this film really deserves 10+ stars! I first saw this movie on pay per view somewhere in the later part of the 90's and you know how there are really only a few titles to great flicks that you can actually remember? Put it this way, 9 years later I still never forgot "My Family" The cast is wonderful the acting couldn't be better. It reaches into the soul of the heart and is one heck of a film that you'll never forget.. 
I admit I didn't have much confidence in this movie at first, when Jennifer Lopez was the actress who played the mother. However, things began to pick up, and the theme of the story began to appear in numerous events. The relationship between the characters is intricately acted out, especially between the bonds of parents and children. Each member of the family is unique; there's Chucho with his rebellious nature, Memo with his desire to fit in and "succeed", Toni with her political endeavors, Irene with her family and restaurant, Jimmy, who is misunderstood by most, and Paco, the eldest son and narrator, who aspires to become a writer. The mother keeps this family together with her strength and love, and the "jefe" seems strict and unyielding at first, but throughout the movie, the audience can see that he really cares about his family. Following the different characters' eventful and sometimes difficult lives, one sees the importance of identity and family 
This film is a true inspiration to me and gives us all a glimpse into the potential for positive representation of the Latino experience in the United States. The acclaimed director, producer and co-writer of this fantastic film, Mr. Gregory Nava, should've received an Academy Award for his masterful direction of this film, and I believe the actors in this film should've been acknowledged as well. At a time where we all need a voice and are searching for a means to express our experiences in the world, this film is such a blessing for us all to watch. Through the eyes of three generations of the Sanchez family, a Mexican-American family based in East Los Angeles, we get a sense of their triumphs and struggles that are universal to the human condition, as well as the racism, discrimination, displacement and the struggle for bicultural identity that they all face together as the seasons change. Jose Sanchez, an ambitious young man from Michoacan walked across the border between Mexico and California when it was literally "a line in the dirt" and took up roots there to start a new life and raise a family. The young Jose is played by a beaming, soulful and spirited Jacob Vargas (an actor who has been made a fool of in numerous films since, in "token Latino roles" such as drug dealers and thugs--what a waste of phenomenal talent!), and is then by the legendary Mexican actor, Edward Lopez Rojas. His beautiful wife, Maria, who he first meets while clipping the hedges overlooking a mansion, while she is the nanny to a bunch of little children, is played by the young Jennifer Lopez, who is beautiful, glowing and full of life and courageous inner strength. The older Maria is played by a soulful and tender Jenny Gago. Other wonderful actors in this film include: Edward James Olmos (Paco Sanchez, their son and storyteller), Jimmy Smits (Jimmy Sanchez), Constance Marie (Antonia Sanchez), and Elpidia Carrillo (Isabel Sanchez, Jimmy's Salvadorean wife--a beautiful actress we have seen far too little of!). The earthy cinematography in this film is comparable to the great murals and naturalistic portraits of Diego Rivera. The vibrant colors and wonderful flashbacks of Mexico make you feel like you are taking the journey with Jose Sanchez from Michoacan to Los Angeles. Beautiful, touching, warm, authentic and lovingly done. We need more films like this to encourage our youth, inspire the generation of today and reach people from all cultural backgrounds. Hopefully, with films like this, we can work toward bringing more projects about life, the experience of Latinos and bicultural identity to the foreground through film 
This is a fine film that stresses the importance of culture and family while never losing its entertainment value. Following the same Mexican-American family from one generation to the next, the film crams a lot into a two hour running time, but the story is effective, well-told, and moving. While some of it was a bit far-fetched, especially Jennifer Lopez's opening bit as the younger version of Maria, the mother, crossing an angry river with her newborn son, the film does pick up and becomes a moving epic about a tough family and their struggles. The casting is terrific, each cast member very believable with their strong performances. I enjoyed this movie and it made me appreciate all my parents have done to keep our family together. This is a terrific slice-of-life made enjoyable by the realism and top-notch cast 
Terriffic Movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt 
This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that. I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry. My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other. This scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film. Although it's the last time that Mitch ever sees Morrie alive, it's still very sweet and poignant. The ending is pretty sad, but it's also happy at the same time. Morrie is gone, yet his legacy lives on. I recommend this movie to anyone, of any gender, of any age. 
This movie was so very well done, and so very sad. It will reach-around from behind you and pleasure you in a way you didn't expect, but will leave you feeling very sad at the end. Sad, but inspired - and that is what this movie is about. Inspiration. Morrie was a great, stand-up character who was always "pitching a tent", so to speak. I highly recommend this movie 
This is an excellent story about what life is really all about. The book and DVD make excellent gifts too. I highly recommend both products! 
 The film exhibition as the act of dying can be lived with love and people that love each other enter, creating a protection atmosphere, of support, of peace. Morrie gives us a life lesson in the death 
I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen 
Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
This movie makes you think about things we don't think about everyday.... life, death, and what's important. Defintiely an eye-opener... deep and emotional at times. 
I had read the book first befoe viewing the TV movie and to tell you the truthe i couldn't tell which came first: the chicken (movie) or the egg (book) Jack Lemon and the rest of the cast were suberb 
It took me all of 4 hours to read this book. It was insightful and entertaining. It was also sad. I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours. I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever 
I love this movie. It came out a couple of years after I personally had some what of the same experiences. I had a baby when I was 15 and my boyfriend and I split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later (married at 17) so unlike what 'Rochelle O'Gorman' says (who gave the Editorial Review on this movie) teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality. I think it is a good moral story that shows it is possible to make it and stay together even when you do get together and have a baby young. 
For when you need a little Molly Ringwald fix that 16 candles just won't satisfy. Fantastic! 
I am MOLLY RINGWALD's Fan,I have two Laserdisc OF FOR KEEPS 1988 [ NEW ] And Used,I love it much thats why I bought it on DVD TOO,You won't regret it : 
I have always loved this movie. Too me it is a comfort movie because I have seen it so many times growing up. I recently let my 13 year old neice watch it and she loved it too. I didnt think she would like it that much because its a big time 80's flick but she loved it. Now she wants to watch it everytime she comes over 
Molly Ringwald shines in this film as she portrays a high school senior who ends up pregnant. She and the father get married and try to stick it out... she tries to work while pregnant, he tries to help his dad out... nothing seems to work. They get their own place and have to deal with their electricity being shut off so they end up moving in with her mother, which is difficult for everyone. Molly's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he's willing to give it up to help her with the baby, but she doesn't want him to. In the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does. Mixed in with the humor and comedy, there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young. It's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from 
This is really one of my favorite Molly Ringwald movies...of course all of them great...this one stands out a lil more ...Its a more serious role of something thats happening everyday...I was also excited this came to dvd....I give her alot of props for this one 
For Keeps where shall I start. For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network. Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film). The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant. They struggle to stay together. I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture. It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times. The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up. Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection 
I LOVE this movie and I was so worried it would never get to DVD since not many people have even heard of it. Its one of those movies that you can watch in your PJ's over and over. I just think of it as a comfort movie, I'm sure plenty of people would think thats crazy but I really like it =o 
All about THE Benjamins is a funny @$$ movie.Mike Epps is funny. The polt of the movie is very interesting and funny. I recomend that you watch it soon if you have not seen it yet. :) 
I enjoyed this film about a bounty hunter (Ice T) who chases a con man who keeps eluding him. When the con man wins the mega lottery and then loses his ticket (in the boat of a nasty villian) he tries to enlist the aid of Ice T to get it back. Unfortunately for him, Ice T does not believe him about the ticket and is not only interested in collecting the bounty for the con man and also recovering several million in diamonds that a bad guy has. Eventually, Ice T starts to believe the con man and they somewhat work together but Ice T maintains a short leash on him until he can beat the villian and get the diamonds. There are some really hilarious scenes and both Ice T and the con man put in excellent performances. An overlooked gem that is as good as any of the Lethal Weapon films 
yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
Another hilarious cube vision movie. Mike Epps is one of the funniest guys on the planet and Cube's serious personna make for a classic goofy guy/straight guy combination. Get some popcorn, take a few deep breaths, cause you will laugh. Its a gas!! 
WOW. This movie is outrageous. It was a great movie for both Ice Cube and Mike Epps. They were both great in Next Friday, so I was ready for this movie. I recommend this movie to those who enjoy comedy with their action. There is a lot of both here. I also recommend Friday After Next, because Ice Cube and Mike Epps are in that as well 
When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think. Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for "enjoyment." That being said, I love this movie, and here's why. 1. It's a true story. 2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the "wrong" country. How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country? This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian. If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time 
IN A NUTSHELL: UNDERRATED - UNDERVALUED - UNDEREXPOSED - Excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event! It is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are ideally suited as Soviet naval Captains, and as believable as their rebuilt authentic K-19! Kathryn Bigelow who Directed and Produced the film did an incredible job, which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the DVD. BOTTOM LINE: THIS NEW KIND OF SUB FILM IS A PART OF HISTORY If you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best. If you enjoy thrillers, this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone. 
For those who don't know russian the title of this was (Просмотрение K-19 - Review of K-19, thought I'd be funny there) This movie is not so much a combat movie it's a what happened movie. The flagship of the Russian Navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 Captians, yea that kinda don't go over so well. They have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys. It is quite a gripping movie though. This is also one that needs to be bought not just rented 
This was a true story and a scary part of our history. The book comes to life in the movie... I pictured another person as the captain of the Sub... Mr. Ford did a good job acting the part 
I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice 
There are so much information about this movie in Amazon.com description and other reviews so I don't want to repeat them. The only problem in this movie was Harisson Ford's style, he was acting more American than Russian and for moments you may feel that K-19 is an American submarine and Harisson Ford is an American Captain. He was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts, he couldn't deny his American Friquent Style! I think Harrison Ford for this movie was not a wise Decision. I know, starring First class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie 
K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense. Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men. Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571". The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
The acting, writing, and complete look of the film are completely fantastic. Everything is fantastic, but Jim Carrey steals the scenes, in a very good way. Every time he is on the screen, he is pure Jim. The character he plays on the movie is as if it was written just for him, he fits is role perfectly. The scenery in the movie is very dark and gloomy, which sets the perfect tone for the film. The costumes; suits and dresses, all look great and the entire things comes together very nicely. Overall, this is a must see for fans of Jim Carrey. If you love a good movie, you will love this. Like I said, this role was made for JC!! 
Both of my daughter's read the entire series of books [so far] and I decided to treat them to this film when it was released. Or was it the other way around. Anyway, suffice it to say, I was more than pleased with this film. The devious Count Olaf [Jim Carrey] was a true joy to watch. And the laughter from my daughters was more than worth sitting through the movie. I really enjoyed the film, and let me tell you, children as well as adults will enjoy this film! On a visual level, the film is absolutely stunning: sort of a Tim Burton influence. I really liked the part of Aunt Josephine [Meryl Streep]. There is a hilarious part with her and Count Olaf as she is about to be let go on one of the boats. (I'll let you viewers watch this part, as I don't wish to spoil it for you). And the house Aunt Josephine resides in at Lake Lachrymose has a surrealistic and eerie look to it. Just great! If you have not seen the film, then rent it or buy it. I found it to be hilarious and as much fun for adults as well as children. I really do hope they make another one: as the books continue for quite some time. I believe the first three books were the basis for this particular film. I would like to see more misadventures of the Baudelaire children with their nemesis Count Olaf, I don't know if there will be, but it would be great. And how about the end credits? Best I have ever seen: A work of art in itself. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed--especially if you have children. 
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, the movie, is an adaptation of the first 3 books in the Lemony Snicket's printed books. The movie plot is very much the same as the story of the first three books. #1 - The Bad Beginning #2 - The Reptile Room #3 - The Wide Window In the Series of Unfortunate Events isn't a happily ever after kind of story. There are three regular children: Violet, who loves to invent Klaus, who loves to read and Sunny who loves to bite Violet is the oldest, Claus the middle child, Sunny is the youngest. The book "The Bad Beginning" is the basis for the first part of the movie. The story begins when the Baudelaire children are informed by Mr. Poe, a banking accountant, that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire, and thus begins a series of search for a suitable guardian and a safe place to live. The siblings closest member to their parents is supposedly Count Olaf, only he's not nice. He's exactly the opposite and he plans to steal the immense fortune left by the Baudelaire parents. In The Bad Beginning, things, well, begin badly for the three Baudelaire orphans. And sadly, events only worsen in The Reptile Room. As the siblings move in with their new guardian Professor Montgomery, they find he is a reptile scientist. In a room with many different reptiles, there's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly, dangerous snake. But it's not really dangerous at all. Later Montes get a new assistant and it is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course something terrible happens to Uncle Morty after that and Count Olaf again tries to kidnap the children. In the Wide Window, Mr. Poe places the children with a distant relative, Aunt Josephine. Aunt Josephiine lives in a house on the edge of a hill, a house that is very literally above Lake Lachrymose, a lake infested with Lachrymose Leeches who would eat a human if they smelled food on them. Aunt Josephine is as eccentric as other relatives have been. She's a total grammar freak and so scared of every thing that the children have to live in a cold house and eat cold food because their aunt is afraid of accidents with fire. When Aunt Josephine meets Captain Sham who (who is Count Olaf in disguise), good fortune turns bad. Aunt Josephine dies and the apparent cause of death is jumping through the wide window in the living room, leaving the three children to Captain Sham (who is Count Olaf in disguise). As the orphans try to figure out a way to escape from Count Olaf, they discover their aunt is still alive and in hiding. So they set out to find her and convince her to come back. This eventually leads them out onto the dreadful Lake Lachrymose where Count Olaf and the dreaded leaches catch up with them. While the books leave much to the imagination, the visual effects and stunning backdrdops of the movie are well detailed, in contrast to the often sparse details in the books. 
I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round. The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but "Lemony Snicket..." entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!). There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzmï¿½n, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Cedric the Entertainer...) in small roles. Sublime film. It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, and if you like unique plots, highly recommended for all type of audiences! 
This movie is based on the first three books in the series of thirteen very short volumes. A lot of people, who apparrently hadn't read the book(s) say Jim Carey basically played himself in the movie, but this couldn't be further from the truth--he played the part perfectly. I'm not a big Jim Carey fan, but think he does get a bad rap for no apparrent reason. The last big criticism of him was for Cable Guy--in which he actually played a serious role. I suppose Cable Guy was a comedy, but it was a 'black comedy' and this movie is much the same. Sure this movie (and the written story) is funny, but it's also in that Harry Potter (or Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland, or The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, or many other much greater and confirmed classic 'children's stories') stream of being a good story for children that's not the traditional 'happily ever after.' It wont give your kids nightmares or bruise their fragile sensibilities, but it might fire a few more brain cells than other childrens stories which strain themselves not to cross those lines parents draw in our V-chip American society. Put more frankly, your kids wont turn into serial killers because they watched or read something that wasn't completely innocent, puritanical, or childish. Bottom Line: Because the movie really turned me onto the books, I'm glad I saw it. I also think this is a great performance by Jim Carey, from whom we normally expect only silliness. 
I saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film 
This is Carey at his best. This movie is hilarious and the special features are awesome 
A delightful little movie based on a series of delightful little children's stories (with, maybe, a bit more bite than the average fare). Of course, it won't be for everyone. A Series of Unfortunate Events is about the three Baudelaire orphans who are shuttled from foster home to foster home pursued by the evil Count Olaf. A laughable, over-the-top villain determined to capture the orphans' family fortune. This movie takes the first three novels of the series (purported to be 13 books in all, plus an "autobiography" of the "author") and blends them wonderfully into one tale (sticking the 2nd and 3rd into the middle of the first book). It brings the tales to life with delightful scenery and excellent casting. Jim Carrey brings Olaf to life. And, YES, he is "overacting" but he is absolutely true to the character in the books. He is perfect in his role. Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep have great turns as well. If you're a fan of these books, you likely won't be disappointed. If you've never read them, you may like this movie too, just know that it's a little stylized and "over the top." In the end, it's a lot of fun, and not that's not such an unfortunate thing in a film 
ANDROMEDA STRAIN WAS A GRATE MOVIE IF YOU LIKE THE OLDER SCIFI MOVIES. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET I WOULD RECOMEND YOU SEE IT. IT DOES GET LONG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE BUT BY THE END OF IT THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTION. GREAT FOR ALMOST ALL AGES THAT LIKE AND ENJOY OLDER SCIFI MOVIES 
I remember watching this film when it first came out in a theatre in Manhattan Beach, California. [During a time when you got two films for the price of one] I remember how fascinating the film was, and wondering if microbes were that bad. Not understanding everything the film discussed, I did know that something terrible had happened in a town in New Mexico. Everybody but a baby and an old man had been killed. But why did these two humans survive? [No Spoilers] Moreover, when the Doctors who are assembled at a secret bio-hazard facility, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force, try and figure out what danger Earth is in due to this new microbe, I sat riveted to my seat. I was thrilled at how the directors and special effects people were able to make a film that even a young teenager could enjoy. In their race to contain a microbe that has been picked up by a satellite falling back to earth, the actors as scientists in the film created an atmosphere of suspense and dread that stayed with me even after I had left the theatre with my older brothers. The way in which the film is handled is intelligent. There is no silly dialogue and used up time. These scientists make you feel as if the entire human race is going to be determined by either their success or failure. And that is why this film has stood the test of time. There is no CGI in this film, yet when you see the microbe and the computer systems at work, you get a feeling that this is really happening. At least it felt that way as a young boy. This film is highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5 
Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme. It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither). The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic. But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst. This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.) If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension. I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way. I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud. 
From the other reviewers you already know it is about some foreign piece of bio-hazard that lands in this small town in New Mexico killing everyone but two people. But the question is... why is this old move based on a story by Michael Crichton so good? There are many sci-fi movies. We know why Jurassic Park was a hit. It was the first time someone thought of taking DNA and then re-created pre-historic dinosaurs - and then it was all done in fabulous beautiful color with special effects and helicopter shots and scenes in the rain. But this movie does not have that. Andromeda Strain is in black and white about a small group of people and dominated mainly by Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) and Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) locked underground in this small laboratory trying to figure out what is this biohazard (exactly) and how can they control it. They use various gadgets including scanning electron microscopes etc. all dressed in white lab coats - the stereotypical scientists, never entertaininng people!! My take on it is that it has a certain feel like the "Twilight Zone" where you really do not know if this investigation will succeed or suddenly go terribly wrong. It leaves you glued to the movie (TV). In fact it turns out that the "thing" is not from our world. It grows when it is radiated and they almost have a disaster blow up in their face. It is all just very suspenseful and well executed, i.e.: good acting and directing, with enough technical stuff to make it seem credible. 5 Stars 
If you enjoy scientific investigation, a slow paced scenario, and mystery, this movie is a total success. I was riveted on my seat from beginning to end. Splendid. Not a movie for action-lovers or brainless jerks 
"Andromeda Strain" is based on the first major novel by Michael Crichton (author of "Jurassic Park," et al). It reaps the benefits of "2,001: A Space Odyssey," in the sense that science fiction movies back then started to become big budget and could be taken seriously. Significantly, David Wise ("The Day the Earth Stood Still") directs, and a good ensemble was chosen to act out the roles. The story is about a mass invasion, but instead of tangible beings appearing like "War of the Worlds," we get some sort of disease, instead. (Perhaps, then, it is the inverse of the H. G. Wells' classic.) There are innovations of technical achievement that make this movie worthwhile from the start. The movie is detailed, yet engaging throughout. It seldom gets too technical, and it seldom matters if one misses the boat regarding all of the facts presented. The explanations are mainly meant to give the story a plausible execution. The tension ebbs and flows in an effective way, mostly from the fine acting performances, which are credible and entertaining throughout. The strife between four expert scientists (Arthur Hill, David Wayne, Kate Reid, and Jimmy Olson) and the tension of their task is tangible. (Reid's performance as the acerbic Dr. Ruth Levit is particularly funny and sharp.) Their gathering, called upon during biological crises, is central to the movie's success. The timing and music also create a genuine atmosphere of crisis. Otherwise, the story unfolds like a detective mystery with clues appearing quickly along the way. While it may seem to some that it is a fanciful concept to acquire new biological life forms without the usual characteristics that our life forms have, there is enough suspension of our disbelief to make the adventure worthwhile. The extras are particularly good for a DVD. The technical explanations regarding the movie's creation are almost as detailed as the scientific ones given in the movie. The interviews are stimulating, although extras on DVD's always have the effect of going back behind the stage after a magic show. It is a mixed blessing: One's curiosity is satisfied at the expense of revealing the effect of the magic. Nevertheless, the extras are awesome. Michael Crichton and Robert Wise are featured, and both are very articulate and resourceful at explaining their crafts 
It is nice to find a movie that believes that its viewers have an IQ over 60. Hollywood doesn't make enough of these types of movies. The movie itself is quite thrilling. The last half an hour actually has you sitting on the edge of your seat. I found it to be quite entertaining and well worth checking out. The acting wasn't the best, but I've most definately seen worst. It was refreshing for the director to choose several "no name" actors so that we can enjoy the progress of the story and not be distracted by celebrities. It added a lot of realism to the movie. The best part about the DVD was the makeing-of feature. It is amazing how much was done with the lack of technology that Hollywood has now. It was even interesing how they had killed their monkey. If you enjoy the movie I highly suggest you check out the feature as well. It is only half an hour long but I had wished it could have been longer and more detailed 
I liked this movie when it first came out.Most of the reveiws on this site gave it problems.Movies of this sort do.This is a SciFi movie from the 70's.What is the problem?Just get over it and enjoy. 
My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss. Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD. Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion. Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it. One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld. The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it. According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history. So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge. On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease." Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software. "Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES. This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes). So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect. Even the bad guys seem familiar. Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer. They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl. Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree. The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner. A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development. I am normally opposed to remakes. For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films. The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake. But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original. The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life. As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive. For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs. The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects. The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle. My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum. All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film. It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation: JURASSAIC PARK. Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks. Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie. 
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie 
A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood. Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World. Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale. Seriously, why is somebody not making this already 
I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night. She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film. One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene. I like chase scenes. Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection. A few good comic shots. Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break. 
I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!  
It was a great movie. If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there. I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real. It was a movie worth buying 
In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them. Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land". The DVD has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi. Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall 
I'm in my mid-30's and this is the first exercise video I ever bought because the model doing the backbend on the cover caught my eye, (I'm big on flexibility). I'd never even heard of Lotte Berk before. The editorials that wrote Lotte Berk is a good workout without breaking a sweat lied! I sweat and my body parts trembled as I held on trying to get through the reps. I'm very active and usually exercise outdoors (biking, jogging, hiking, kayaking) but Lotte Berk found muscles that I obviously wasn't using and I was impressed. Lastly, I think the instructors are classy and I want to look as fit and sexy as they do so of course I bought the rest of the series. Lotte Berk kicks butt! 
I have been doing the Firm for a few years now and needed some variety. I ordered this video a few months ago and it sat in my entertainment stand until today. I really wanted to do something different and remembered i had this video. So I tried it and I loved it. It was very different and also fun. The leg work was very challenging. I also liked the instructor a lot and her helpers. They all looked great. I would recommend this video, it was quick and efficient 
When I ordered this video, I thought "How hard could it really be--it's only 30 minutes long." But I found out even 30 minutes of Lotte Berk can be VERY hard. The first 15 minutes is upper body work which was challenging but not ridiculously so. (I'm an intermediate exerciser.) But the last 15 minutes of lower body work was really tough for me. I try to do this video 2-3 times a week and I have really seen results. My saddlebag thighs are starting to disappear and my upper leg muscles are looking longer and leaner. I highly recommend this video. It's 30 minutes that gets results 
The Lotte Berke Method is a non-traditional type of toning developed by a dancer of the same name. It emphasizes the creation of long, lean (not bulky) muscles through the use of small, precise movements, and it has inspired similar methods such as Callanetics. In MUSCLE EATS FAT, the focus is on whole-body toning. The workout begins with a warm-up, a type of high-legged marching in place, and includes simple stretches. The first section targets the arms using light weights. The movement are similar to traditional toning (eg, bicep curls and tricep extensions) but are made unique by both the preciseness of each movement as well as the use of the "Lotte Berk tuck," an isometric stance which works the legs while working the upper body. The arm section finishes on the floor with some tough plank moves which also work the buttocks. The leg work comes next; although the moves are displayed using a ballet barre, a sturdy, high-backed chair works fine. These exercises clearly derive from ballet and really target the thigh muscles. Again, the Lotte Berk tuck is used to increase the work on both the legs and the hip area. The final exercises for the lower body are done on a mat using the signature Lotte Berk movement, Knee Dancing--again, you will really FEEL this in your thighs. The workout ends with a final stretch, although in the Lotte Berk Method, stretches are also woven throughout following each strength move. The video is led by three Lotte Berk certified instructors. The main instructor, Barbara, looks amazing for her age, which she says is close to 50. She's a bit goofy in her comments (eg, repeatedly saying "did you feel that?" and "I love this workout!"), but she provides good information and cuing. The remaining two instructors do not speak, but one shows modifications. The Lotte Berk Method is great for all exercisers who are looking for a different but challenging strength workout, including those at a beginning level 
I have lost 70 pounds over the past year, and have used a variety of exercise videos - pilates, weights, aerobics, dance - and this video is different than anything else I have used. For the first time in I don't know when, my leg muscles were shaking after completing this workout. If you are an exercise buff, and are looking for something different, I highly recommend this video. It is only a half hour long, which is shorter than most of my workouts, but believe me you will feel it. If you love pilates, I am sure you will enjoy this video, but if you are mostly into aerobics, than this is probably not for you. I plan on getting more Lotte Berk videos asap! : 
A great movie. I liked this movie because I like the way Sinatra talks and sings. He is a natural actor always ready with a 'tough-guy' quip delivered with perfect pace and vocal variety. Kim Novak for me is a fabulous actress. Not only is she beautiful but she plays the part of a shy and hesitant starlet perfectly. The songs and the story are great both of which I have transfered to my i-pod to listen to over and over again. 
This movie, if nothing else, defines my childhood. Appearing on "The Children's Hour" with Ed Herlihy every Saturday, amid early morning rehearsals, and all that, I saw this movie at least 20 times! Mom was a real Sinatra fan. There have been so many remakes of what are now considered clsssic songs by Sinatra and gang, but(thanks to Mom) I have the original LP and know a good rendition when I hear it. If ever. Guess you had to be there and experience the movie. I was just 8-years-old at the time and, even at that age, able to figure out that "Pal Joey" was something special. It's fun! It's a lark!! It's an era!!! It's Rogers and Hart!!! 
Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception. Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either. Rita is the fading star. It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow. The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad. Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos. It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself. Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool. Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals. Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog. He stole every scene he was in. Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie 
I suppose much can be said about this movie's lack of faithfulness to the stage play. A hardened Joey, a more callous Joey, an essentially darker Joey... these things are worth exploring and would be interesting to see. Also, if the cut songs are as good as the ones included, then we have indeed lost much, for the numbers in the film are uniformly excellent. With that said, there is nothing wrong in having the cynic in us take a back burner for once, and watching a pretty decent feel-food movie with a fabulous cast, superb performances, and really excellent music. Perhaps the one downer in the film is Kim Novak who, even though she does a respectable job in "My Funny Valentine", still manages to irk. Reminiscent of a female Keanu Reeves (she was great in "Vertigo" for a reason: She just had to act doe-eyed and aloof. Perfect!) she is pretty annoying here. Oh, and lest we forget, the dream sequence is also burdensome, but it was almost a rite of passage before the ending of a whole lot of musicals, so we'll tolerate it here. As for the great aspects of the film, there are many: Rita Hayworth is excellent, with "Zip" as her defining moment in the film. Sinatra, of course, is simply fantastic, and elevates the "Lady is the Tramp" sequence to new heights of artistry. Buy it for Sinatra, fall in love with Rita Hayworth, and tolerate Kim Novak 
This film is worth watching over and over again, if only to see Sinatra's rendition of "The Lady is a Tramp", which he sings with riveting style and musical finesse. Based on a book and play by John O'Hara, it boasts some snappy dialogue and a fabulous Rodgers and Hart score, with songs like "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered", "I Could Write a Book", "What do I Care for a Dame ?", "Plant You Now, Dig You Later", "Happy Hunting Horn" and "That Terrific Rainbow". Rita Hayworth does a sumptuous "Zip" (I love the way she uses her lavish Jean Louis gown in the number), and Kim Novak is absolutely stunning singing "My Funny Valentine". Novak was one of the loveliest and most underrated stars to ever grace the silver screen, and this was her second film with Sinatra, having done the dramatic "The Man with the Golden Arm" two years earlier. The film only received some Oscar nominations (Art/Set Direction, Costume Design, Editing, Sound), but Sinatra did pick up a 1958 Golden Globe Best Actor/Musical-Comedy for his part as Joey, the womanizing, fast talking, con-man singer, who goes from town to town, leaving debts and broken hearts behind; Sinatra makes the most of the part, and one cannot imagine anyone else that could have played Joey to such perfection. Terrific direction by George Sidney and choreography by Hermes Pan complement this trio of great stars and splendid music, with the backdrop of San Francisco and Harold Lipstein's cinematography. Total running time is 109 minutes. 
This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them. For a theater lover this is heartbreaking. What a disappointing story. If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer. Even the ending was changed and not for the better. The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing. A pretty face is not enough 
We've had this LP for years and I've never seen the movie til yesterday. The soundtrack conjours up all sorts of visual images, and seeing the music on film was fabulous. This is Frank at his best, and the "mouses" played by Kim Novak Rita Hayworth were sensational. 
This movie is just as good as I remembered. It's a classic Disney fairy tale, full of love, longing, fear, action, and beautiful songs. And the scene with Sebastian and the chef is priceless! If you haven't seen it yet, you can't miss this film 
I'd forgotten how good this film was, I really had, I had vague memories of being sat down in front of a video, and there was a large scary lady in purple doing bad things. But that was it, I'd forgotten how heart-warming and beautiful the film was. The first step toward making this film a true Disney masterpiece, is the fact that the story is so strong. I was totally engrossed by it, and didn't get bored for a moment. I had forgotten about the sweet scenes in the town and by the river, they are what a film needs, character development and just a slight expansion of the story beyond the basic bones of the tale. Sure, it's not a faithful rendition of the original tale, but it isn't about tragedy, it's about love and your dreams coming true. The animation, whilst not as accomplished as some of their slightly later films (such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame) is a delight to behold, and it really makes the mer-people seem very believable in the movement and actions. The animators of Ariel must of been very pleased with themselves, she comes across as being real (well, as real as a cartoon can be) I can see in her facial expressions will genuine expressions, not pale imitations as is so often the case in animation. The soundtrack really makes it, generally, I find Disney side-kicks obtrusive and annoying, but Sebastian makes the film, I never imagined reggae style music could manage to be romantic! The key song, is also beautiful, whilst I don't know the title (shameful I know) the words continue to soar through my mind, 'now we can run....etc.!' The extras are also very worthwhile, a fascinating making of, some games for the children and deleted scenes (utilising unused storyboards.) There is also a commentary and a new music video for 'Kiss the Girl.' However the best of them all has got to be the beautiful and tragic, 'The Little Match-Girl,' I can honestly say that few other films have managed to move me so deeply, I couldn't remembered the last time I cried over a film, until I saw this one. I knew it would be special when I watched the introduction by the director, he mentioned how he use to read the story to his children - it made me remember my parents use to read me the story too. I really hope that it will be Oscar Nominated - it deserves it. Equally satisfying for any child or film critic. A true classic. - Rachael 
This is a brilliant film! This is the first of what I like to refer to as The Disney Modern Classics (along with Beauty the Best, Lion King and Aladin). A very touching story set to inspiring music makes this a true gem of cinema. Ursula rocks as one of Disney's most over-the-top and exciting villians 
Finally got around to watching this last night. In this review I'm not going to bother to review the movie itself. It's seventeen years old. I'm sure if you are interested in it you've seen it by now. Rather, I'm going to review the technical quality of the film and the extras provided on the DVD. One thing that feel I should point out up front is that the movie HAS been edited, but only in one scene. The infamous 'clergyman sporting an erection' that caused such a stupid flundie flap has been photoshopped. The theatrical poster artwork is not on the cover or anywhere on the disc for a similar reason. You can find out more by going to Snopes and looking in the Disney films section. I personally don't care, but some people do. Now, on to the review. This version is widescreen, but it's 16:9 widescreen and not theatrical widescreen, but this has been the case in pretty much all the Disney movie DVDs so no surprises there. The Little Mermaid was the next to last movie Disney did using painted cels, and the film has gone through some kind of digital restoration process. There are comparison shots on the back of the DVD box that show the difference. The colors are very vibrant, and I didn't notice any problems with the encoding or animation. There is support for surround sound and audio tracks in English, French, and Spanish. It's a two disk set. Disc one has the movie, the configuration options (subtitles, commentary, language ect), a music video of the song 'Kiss the Girl' by someone I've never heard of, a bunch of previews that will be outdated in a few months, and a preview of what's on disc 2. On the box it touts something called Fast Play, which basically means when you load it in, after the standard FBI warnings and all that, the disc gives you the option of immediately starting the movie or going to the menu with the stuff I just mentioned. If you choose to start the movie directly, it plays a bunch of previews that you can skip past using chapter forward on your remote, if you go to the menu and pick play movie, it starts right away. You're actually not forced to sit through ten minutes of BS previews with no way to skip them like on some of the previous Disney DVDs. I approve. The majority of the extras are on disc 2. It's broken up into three major sections: Backstage Disney, Deleted Scenes, and Games. Backstage Disney is the largest section. It has scads of concept art (imagine Ursula as a lionfish or manta ray instead of an octopus), a videos on how the movie was made, and a new animated short, The Little Match Girl. A silent film with a musical background and is amazingly enough, actually true to the story. It's pretty well done, IMHO. Deleted scenes is just that, stuff that was cut. There really isn't much. Only three selections, and two of them are just pieces that were cut from scenes that did make it in. There's an expanded version of the opening song, a very short scene where Triton's daughters tell Sebastian that Ariel isn't at the recital before it starts, and an extra verse in Ursula's song. All of these were cut before the final animation was done, and so as you watch it switches back and forth between storyboard still shots and very rough sketchy animation. The games I didn't even bother with, because has there ever been a DVD player game that hasn't totally sucked? Didn't think so. Overall, it's going to boil down to how much you like the movie, and how much you hate minor edits. If not seeing Jessica Rabbit with no underwear for three frames bothered you, then this DVD is not for you. Otherwise, it is a comprehensive look at the movie that marked the beginning of Disney's second golden age. I give it 9 out of 10 voice containing seashells 
such a kiddie classic..so cute im 22 and had to have this because i loved it as a ki 
I loved this film. It is for both young and old. The characters are so creative and the music is catchy and intelligent. The voices are perfect for their characters. One of my favorite Disney Films by far! I highly recommend it 
I watched Disney's animated THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) in one nasty, angry mood. Within twenty minutes, I was feeling happy, caught in the spell of a strong story, gorgeous animation, and lively Oscar-winning songs. The magic of Disney for kids of all ages permeates this story of Ariel, the likeable mermaid who falls in love with a human. If she can go without her lovely voice for three days and still get the handsome prince to kiss her, she is a human for life. The catch is that she can never again see her aquatic friends, like her king father and Sebastian the hilarious crab comic relief who almost gets eaten! The central villainess is one of my all-time favorites, Ursula the sea witch, evil enough for adults and not too scary for kids. She has stolen Ariel's lilting voice. The story is taken from Hans Christian Andersen, but with a downbeat ending radically rethought in Disney fashion. But I have a hunch the Andersen literary circle would approve of the changes in making this a wonderful family film. The voice work is perfection, including Jodi Benson as Ariel and Pat Carroll as Ursula. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on the songs; "Under the Sea" won a deserved Oscar, but I like "Part of Your World" and the hilarious "Kiss the Girl" also. The new double-disk DVD of THE LITTLE MERMAID is an absolute must-own, and not just for families with children. If you are a child at heart, like me, you will treasure it. And Disney Studios has restored the heck out of it--the colors are gorgeous, the image clarity is flawless, and the remastered soundtrack does justice to the music. The 83 minute movie is on disk one, at its correct 1.78 moderate wide-screen aspect ratio, along with an audio commentary, should you decide (I did not) to listen to the co-writers and co-directors talk about the movie. (They do enough of that on disk two.) Also on disk one are a trailer for LITTLE MERMAID III (straight to video, probably a wise business decision) and a "Kiss the Girl" music video. There is also a feature that lets you go to a particular song, a popular feature on a movie with these songs and an Oscar-winning music score. Disk two is mammoth, a good three hours. I went to bed at midnight with the whole games section untouched. There are 45 minutes of deleted scenes with commentary on what we are watching and why they were cut out. There is another 45 minutes that goes behind the scenes at Disney Studios in 1989 at a time of great business upheaval to create the mood that this happy and romantic film was made under. We also get a nine minute segment on animated special effects, like sea storms. Disney was apparently thinking of doing THE LITTLE MERMAID back in 1941, but changed his mind and thankfully made DUMBO instead. Or was it PINOCCHIO? THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL is a lovely and sad animated short adaptation of another Andersen story, an exquisite bonus. There are also LITTLE MERMAID art galleries and the original theatrical trailer. I still have Games and Activities to do, so I am not sure what to expect. I gather that Disney was going to do a LITTLE MERMAID ride at Disneyland or Disney World, but changed their minds. There is something called "UNDER THE SEA: A Virtual Ride" and a live-action segment on life under the sea. It's an incredible two-disk DVD, and I have a hunch it belongs in every household. Maybe even two copies--Disney is threatening to put this title back in the vaults for seven more years, and your kids may wear out one copy before seven years is up. THE LITTLE MERMAID is not quite a Walt Disney immortal animated classic for me, but give it another decade and it might be. For the time being, it is a fabulous way to spend a long evening with your kids. Or even alone in a night bedroom. 
If you plan on buying this as a present for some young person's birthday or other event , check with other relatives and friends who will be involved: At two birthday parties recently, -Everyone- bought this for the baby! 
Good movie to show people the difference between ballroom dance and fun dance. Best dance movie I ever seen 
If you like to dance or like to watch other people dance then this is the movie for you. That's especially true if you like a latin beat in your music. Nice story line and in the end girl not only gets the trophy but gets the guy also! A little laughing and a little crying and a lot of dancing. What more could you ask for. 
This is a great movie!!!! I loved the music, dancing, and the intense chemistry between the actors. I especially enjoyed the handsome, sexy Chayanne!!! He's an excellent singer, dancer, and actor!! He and Vanessa looked amazing together. I prefer this movie to Dirty Dancing. If anyone wants to see and hear more of Chayanne, he's in a new commercial, and has realeased a new video from his latest album Cautivo, which has gone multi-platinum! 
I usually stay away from the chick-flick genre that I was forced to watch with my ex-wife, daughter and, prior to that various and sundry dates...but, from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film, I was drawn into the world of proffesional Latin dancing. I readily admit that my initial interest was to see Vanessa, since, in my opinion, she makes too few films. But, the infectious sountrack and the easy-looking, but incredibly intricate dance performances of Chayanne and crew, made me say, to quote a line from the film, "I want to do that, too!" Chayanne, who is probably a superstar in latin circles, gives a utilitarian acting performance, however appealing his personality, and this whole movie was never in danger of being an oscar contender, however, I reiterate, the dance sequences are exilerating. A solid family movie, and with the popularity of "Dancing With the Stars," should be a must-see for fans of that show 
After watching the film and wanting to get up and dance to the music this CD is a dream come true ! "Echa Pa'Lante" is now one of my favourite Cha Cha's and Ruby's Rumba "Eres Todo En Mi" is great to dance with a special partner. "Jazz Machine - Black Machine" is a great Samba track which will also get you on the dance floor. If the film inspired you to get up and dance this CD should be on your playlist 
This is a nice movie. Not an Oscar winner, but very pleasant and no sex (a virtue/shortcoming depending on your point of view). I purchased the movie for the salsa dancing, but all of the dancing and music in the movie are great. From the opening scenes staged in Cuba to the last dance scene the the movie is big time fun. It also is beautifully filmed. Chaynne and Vanessa are both easy on the eyes so each gender will enjoy it. The movie is defintely worth a viewing 
I love a good dance movie and this is one for the collection. This dvd sells for about $7.00 at thiat price it is a very good buy 
This movie is great. Vanessa Williams is not only beautiful, but you would think she has been competing in professional Latin dancing for real-she is very talented. Chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming-not to mention easy on the eyes. The dance scenes are HOT!! It is loaded with not only great dances, but great Latin music and likable characters. It is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor!!!   
Thank God for this essentially preserved movie version of the stage hit by one of my all time favorite broadway actresses Gwen Verdon. She just lights up the screen. Bob Fosse's dances are spectacular and the music by Ross and Adler is just classic. They just don't make them like this anymore. Sheer heaven in hell-with the devil played by the incomparable Ray Walston. If you love musicals, you must add this to your collection! 
i remeber, seeing this movie baasically, when it was first released. and as I have a large collection of musicals, I wanted to add it to my collection, as i had not seen it available in Australia. After viewing Damn Yankees after 40 50 years, was very enjoyable, Gwen Verdon great, and Tab Hunter, yes 
Once upon a time, Broadway musicals were quickly adapted into successful widescreen presentations, often, but not always, with the original Broadway stars. This is an example of one of Hollywood's best. A previous reviewer called this stagebound. I am not sure what was meant. "My Fair Lady" and "Mary Poppins" are musicals shot entirely on soundstages, and look it; "Damn Yankees!" involved several outside locations, including the old Los Angeles Wrigley Field, which was home to the Los Angeles Angels in their first season in 1961. It was a great backdrop for the "Shoeless Joe" number. The film is not in stereo (even though the CD soundtrack is); I don't know if the stereo soundtrack album would matchup with the film soundtrack, or whether there stereo tracks recorded. In any event, Warner Bros. did not dig them out, and this DVD is bereft of any significant extras. Apart from that, this is a must buy for classic performances (Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon, particularly), wonderful songs ((You Gotta Have) Heart, Shoeless Joe, etc.), and some great smaller roles (the crusty Senators' manager, Jean Stapleton playing Edith Bunker 15 years before she played Edith Bunker, and Bob Fosse dancing with Gwen Verdon) 
Gwen Verdon at her finest. Great performances by an amazing cast. Great music and incredible choregraphy. Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse - such a team 
The audio/video quality of the original movie is not quite up to modern picture and sound standards, and the original play and movie we indelibly tied to the 50's scene ("Cool, man"), but the transition to DVD has not hurt it a bit. The songs and dancing are very stylized, definitely reflecting Donen's handicraft. Seeing the actors when they were almost kids is very interesting. I definitely enjoyed it 
This classic show was skillfully brought to film and the casting is great. Gwen Verdon is fabulous as Lola and Ray Walston as the Devil is superb. Well worth having for collectors of American Musical Theater 
Thankfully unlike other movies that I remembered seeing years ago this one lived up to expectations with Ray Walston as the Devil stealing the show 
Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own. I own this book...this play because I read it while in a Humanities course in college. I went to college rather "late" in life...whatever that means...and yet I derived more from the experience than I probably would have had I gone right after High School. I am one of those people who believe that it's not college that makes a "well-rounded" indivividual, but life experience. If colleges and universities handed out degrees based on Life Experience, I'd probably have a doctorate three times over... We were given the assignment of reading this play and seeing the live production that the college I was attending just so happened to be putting on. With my primary focus being on philosphy, I embraced the Existentialism Unit that we were now focused upon. My best friend, who was/is an "atheist" was less receptive of these Existentialist ideas he considered strange and elusive. You think he, being an atheist, would have been more open to them than I who had already been bitten by the Metaphysics/Spirituality plague. Truth be told I think the only reason he says he's an atheist is because he's a cheapskate and doesn't want to shell out extra money for Christmas gifts. So we go see this play and people were getting pretty agitated. In this play everything goes round and round but never arrives at any final conclusions and I noticed how we, as a society, love our answers. We are not soothed by questions and proposistions and "what if?" scenarios. We feel the need to latch onto something because something is better than nothing. Isn't it? The Existentialists believe that the universe is random, chaotic, and ultimately meaningless and so in a sense they "give" meaning to meaninglessness. Just like an atheist believes in non-belief. You see, the human species cannot not give meaning to his/her life...we cannot not believe...we can "pretend" that life is without meaning and that we don't believe but everything that falls onto the screen of our perception, will take on the shape of our perceptions. I loved this play. I loved the merry-go-round type dialouge. Isn't this what we all do? We get a belief so engrained in our heads and we think that it is the only way to believe and so we spend a lot of time trying to convince someone who may not be as receptive to our point of view as to why it's valid. What I have learned over the years is that the only reason why a belief is valid is because we are the ones who validate it. It doesn't make us "more right" than the person who doesn't believe it, it just makes us believers of the belief. And contrary to popular opinion, the more people you have who also believe the same way you believe does not prove that it's any more valid than if only one person believed it. This play did not dissolve me into a puddle of desperation and futileness, in fact it added more meaning to my life which would probably make Samuel Beckett gag. It made me fall in love even more with this crazy life that only I can live. Nobody lives by proxy. Each of us are liberated and imprisoned by our beliefs. The best we can ever hope to be is determined by what we are willing to believe at any given time. This is why it's a good practice to sit down and journal about your beliefs from time to time and question why you still believe what you believe. You may have outgrown certain beliefs, certain ideas, certain ways of being in the world but don't be like the two "bums" in the play, don't keep postponing what it is that you eventually desire to see; see it now, live it now, be it now. If you are going to be an atheist, be the best atheist you can be. If you are going to be a Christian, be the best Christian you can be. If you are going to be an Anarchist, be the best Anarchist you can be. Just don't think that everyone is going to believe exactly as you believe and don't make others wrong simply because they may have another point of view. In the end, none of us truly know what's on the other side. Yes, we've had people with Near Death Experiences, but nobody has ever come back after being completely dead with a report, we just have reports from people who have been "mostly dead". Take life with a grain of salt and enjoy the ride. Peace Blessings. 
Waiting for Godot was dubbed a "tragicomedy" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play. The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work. However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you. Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be. Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own. What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality. Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous. Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale. Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold. A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor 
Samuel Beckett's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them. Is Godot God? Are Didi and Gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive, or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering? Waiting for Godot, in proper Modernist fashion, strips away all the layers of narrative and form and leaves nothing but the naked husk of a play, which Beckett no doubt felt revealed the human condition at its most basic. But the play's power doesn't really come from that. Rather, what makes Waiting for Godot so compelling is its wide applicability: it's a story about random oppression, brutality, and dreams deferred by harsh realities. It has been performed as an allegory of apartheid South African, the Jim Crow South, the horror of the war in Bosnia and about every other possible situation imaginable. Why? Because as Benjamin Kunkel pointed out in a piece in The New Yorker not so long ago, "[N]ot everyone has a God, but who doesn't have a Godot?" Beyond the metaphysical implications of the play, though, it's popularity stems from its near-perfection: for all the philosophical meaning people see in it, the action progresses with virtually no direct reference to it, and every line which seems to suggests some sort of grand significance has a very concrete meaning in the action. Take the infamous opening: Estragon, the first of the tramps, struggles to pull off his boot to relieve his swollen foot. Unable to get it off, he gives up and announces "Nothing to be done." Vladimir, wincingly wandering onto the stage and grasping at his crotch (precious few readers and actors for that matter seem to grasp that one of the play's running jokes is Vladimir's venereal disease, which causes him immense pain when urinating), thinks Estragon is commenting on his own ailment, and announces, "I'm beginning to come round to that conclusion myself. All my life I've put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything! And I resumed the struggle." On the one hand, the lines relate concretely to the action of the play; on the other, they have become representative of modern man's ambivalence towards a cruel and uncaring world, and such clever cynicism has linked Beckett to the French Existentialists in whose circles he moved after the Second World War. But seen merely as declamatory statements of world-weary cynicism, the lines lose all their power; Beckett's achievement comes from his ability to link such nihilistic sentiments to extremely comic moments, and it is the humor that carries the reader or the theatergoer through what would otherwise be an unbearably cynical play. Steve Martin, who played Vladimir in a famous 1982 production at the Lincoln Center in New York, put it best when he said that he sought to serve the humor of the play, because the meaning could carry itself but the humor could not. That's a lesson which, sadly, precious few theater directors seem to grasp, but which the careful reader discovers in Beckett. Definitely a must-read, but read it before seeing it, because few productions do it justice 
Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct. In short, this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language, to strip life down to a mere game of waiting. That is, in essence, what this is all about. We have two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up. They don't know why. They don't know exactly when he will be there. Still they wait, eternally, by the tree, by wherever they think he said he would show. This isn't an absurdist play, although it has been labeled as such. Absurdism, though, seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece. We oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex, that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story, but with Waiting for Godot, we have a simple theme: waiting. The two characters symbolize nothing. They are, quite simply, not waiting to be analyzed. They become, in effect, victims of Samuel Beckett's own game: they are his quotation, and he only says what needed to be said at the time, and so he wrote it, whether people would catch on or not, whether they would label it absurdism or not. If you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud, very slowly, word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion, you would probably capture the idea. If it's any indication, he wrote everything in French first--his second language--and then translated it in to English, just so it can be simple. I don't assume, of course, that this work should be cherished simply because it's an exercise in simplicity. But I submit that it should be cherished because it's a genuine, themeless--somehow--masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant, unknown thing that may or may not ever come. It is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous, but somehow, it manages to charm. It is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again, and it has no lyrics, and no meaning--as far as you know--but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity 
I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence. This work, however, is pure tripe. Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas. The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play. In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense. Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of "high art." The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms. Many critics have tried to convince us that WAITING FOR GODOT is very funny and entertaining. I remain skeptical. There are a few moments of wry humor, but not enough to make up for the emptiness of "waiting." There is literally "Nothing to be done" in this play. "Waiting" is a non-action. What's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant; there's something like an "alienation effect," or a "defamiliarization," as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful. Why is there "Nothing to be done"? Is it simply because it's all been done before? Or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning? In many ways, WAITING FOR GODOT is a reaction to the Holocaust and Hiroshima. The characters who have "something to do" in this play are Pozzo and Lucky, who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world. 
Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story. Most drama should be seen on stage, so that the performers can give their characters shape, bring in an audience, and produce a night of dramatic arts. That is not how this story seems to go; not at all, indeed. Beckett's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor. Here are two men, both obviously at the end of their ropes, but each keeps this asinine hope that "GODot" will show up. But, he never does. Extra characters, like Pozzo and Lucky, simply add to the intended confusion. As several previous reviewers have taken note--there is not action. While this idea is spurred by "The Threepenny Opera," Beckett takes postmodernism another step further. The characters' are so disillusioned the question becomes, Godot isn't coming, so did he ever care? Could Godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state. A fantastic read, and one of the best dramas ever written. This fairly short play should be read by EVERYONE. 
Many readers of 'Waiting for Godot' obsess about the identity of Godot and whether he represents God or any other almighty being. It is unlikely that Beckett was referring to God as the man for whom the characters are waiting, as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in Beckett's theatre. Although Beckett was not referring directly to God the name is not without importance. Godot is seen as a messianic being by the characters who will bring salvation for those who believed he would come. The wait for God is not represented by the play, but is used as a template. 'Waiting for Godot' is essentially a sustained metaphor for how most if not all human beings spend their whole life waiting for something that isn't coming. Beckett was not able to identify Godot because of the subjective nature of such a being. As critics have written, this play is a written ink-blot test and a failure to see any coherent meaning says more about the reader than the play. This is yet another example of Beckett's chilling insight into human nature, and his readiness to state what others are unwilling to accept 
Waiting for Godot, a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes, attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with--it is a call to action. This play is packed with nonsensical dialogue. The plot does not exsist. Yet, once we realized that Waiting for Godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense--at least in subtle ways. Much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality, but, that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century. It's enigmatic, a puzzle of words, poetry, and philosophy. I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. The play is short and does not take too much commitment. Take a quiet evening and give it a shot. What are you waiting for 
There are very few films that have literally brought tears to my eyes. They must be films of uncompromising emotional power. Films like Magnolia, The Passion of the Christ, and now Johnny Belinda. It is the story of a deaf and dumb young woman named Belinda. Treated as an unintelligent workhorse all her years, Belinda's life changes forever when a lonely new doctor moves into her small coastal Nova Scotian port town. He takes an immediate liking to her and, proving to her family that she is not the "dummy" they think, he teaches her to read lips. But after a drunken sexual assault leaves her pregnant, rumors begin to fly throughout the small town, and both Belinda and her loved ones must fight for what's right. The performances are wonderful. Of course, Jane Wyman simply steals the show in her Oscar-winning performance. She brings an incredible heart, warmth, and emotional resonance to the character of Belinda, and she does it without ever saying a word. The rest of the cast is marvelous as well, especially Charles Bickford, who lovingly portrays Belinda's father, and Stephen McNally, who turns Belinda's attacker into one of the most easy to loathe characters ever put on celluloid - yet the film still brilliantly keeps him at the level of a realistic personality - no one is a caricature. Director Jean Negulesco brings an understated visual beauty to the film reminiscent of the silent ages, when one had to use aesthetics to make up for the lack of aural stimulus. Every shot is a perfectly composed work of art, turning every moment of Belinda into a masterwork of lighting and raw, majestic nature. The seaside settings are utilized so well that they put Johnny Belinda in league with such legendary jaw-droppers as L'Avventura and Black Narcissus. But this film is much more than just visual appeal. It is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, often simultaneously. There are so many thought-provoking themes to gnaw on in Johnny Belinda - the way people view the handicapped, the bonds of parenthood, the power of rumors, the justification of violence as self-defense, and overall morality and humanity. Even the film's setting could be considered an allegory on Belinda - the brutal waves of the ocean constantly pounding against the serene shores. The film is also, as I mentioned before, emotionally overwhelming. While it certainly has a focused narrative, Belinda is foremost a progression of feelings, and they are so well conveyed that I was simply overcome with joy, pain, heartbreak, and hope. While the film is often described as a melodrama, it is far from a soap opera. There are no miraculous moments of sudden verbal triumph for Belinda, no ridiculously overacted moments of teary-eyed abandon - Johnny Belinda is a terribly real experience. There are aspects of the story that remain unresolved - not loose ends, but difficult problems that would most likely also remain unresolved in reality. However, I don't want to give the impression that Johnny Belinda is depressing. I felt uplifted and rapturous just as often as I felt overcome by grief and fear. I felt so much for these characters and I wanted so sorely for things to turn out a certain way - but I won't reveal whether they do or not. I will say that the film ends on a note of nearly unbearable poignancy, and this is the moment that massaged my tear ducts. My only complaint concerning the film is Max Steiner's score. He is perfectly suited for epic films like King Kong and Gone With The Wind, but here it feels somewhat overdramatic and occasionally awkward. He tends to play up the melodramatic angle and spot score in a ubiquitous manner, which simply doesn't fit with a film like Johnny Belinda. Still, it tends to work more often than not, and it is not a major enough problem to work seriously to the film's detriment. This picture is a true gem. It has been unavailable for years, but thanks to Warner Brothers, it finally has a DVD release, and the restoration is simply glorious - it more than does justice to this cinematic treasure. Do yourself a favor and see Johnny Belinda 
I came across this name of the movie when I went to a Deaf History tour at University of Iowa library last Feb., otherwise, I wouldn't have known about this movie. I wrote down the name of the movie, so I can find the movie to see it and came across Amazon.com that are selling one on DVD with closed-captioned which was a plus. Since I know sign language, it was very interesting to see a big change from the signs in the movie during 1948 to the same words comparing to now in 2006. I can see most of them are different and a couple of them like 'thank you' are still the same. I guess time have changed from 'old-fashioned' signs to 'modernized and simple' signs. It would be interesting if I could talk to Jane Wyman herself in today's sign language and see if she can understand some or not. I wonder if she knows some or have forgotten completely? It was an enjoyable movie with excellent acting by Jane Wyman and Lew Ayres (bless his heart!). I'm sure I will watch the movie again later 
Jane Wyman one the Best Actress Oscar - and rightly so too - for her sensitive and touching portrayal of a deaf mute who blossoms under the attentions of a compassionate young doctor on a Nova Scotian farm. Dealing with the themes of rape, teenage pregnancy, single-motherhood and small town intolerance, Johnny Belinda was probably quite sensational for the late 1940's, the period in which it was made. The film begins as the gentle Dr. Robert Richardson (Lew Ayres) moves to a windswept coastal Nova Scotia town to escape from a spoiled relationship. One night, he is asked to deliver a calf and upon visiting the farm Black McDonald (Charles Bickford), she meets Belinda (Jane Wyman) a young deaf girl, whose unofficial name is "dummy" and is treated like some kind of serving wench. Apparently her mother died giving birth to her and since then her Aunt Aggie (the great Agnes Moorehead), has been holding it against her. Neither her father nor her aunt ever actually believes that there's a sharp mind and deep emotional intuition behind Belinda's innocent faï¿½ade. But Robert sees something quite magical in the girl and he takes the time to teach her sign language and how to read lips when no one else will. Her progress is astonishing, and soon she's altered from a dirty and overworked rapscallion into an attractive and spirited young woman. In fact, she's so pretty that she even attracts the attentions of the town's local bad boy Locky McCormick who gets rotten drunk one night and brutishly rapes her in the McDonald's barn. Belinda internalizes the experience, keeping it a secret. When Robert takes Belinda to see a specialist in the city, he discovers that she is pregnant Unfortunately Belinda ends up pregnant, a fact that Robert discovers when he takes her to a hearing specialist in the big city. Because Belinda won't name the man who attacked her, the townspeople - who are mostly a bunch of god-fearing, intolerant old biddies - quickly assume that Robert is the father. Everything comes to a head when Locky realizes he is the father of the baby now named Johnny Belinda and tries to talk his fiancï¿½ Stella (Jan Stirling) into obtaining custody. What could have been an unadulterated, over-the-top weepy is actually played out in an understated and minimalist way. Wyman avoids going for the grand gestures, playing Belinda with a mixture of quiet sensitivity and respect, and her supporting cast are equally as strong, especially the wonderful Agnes Moorehead who steadily warms to her vulnerable young niece as the story progresses. Of course, due to the censorship restrictions of the time, the handling of the darker themes are a rather whitewashed - we never actually see Belinda when she is pregnant and her delivery of Johnny is so shrouded in mystery it merely looks like she is laying in bed with a severe case of the flu. But the issues of the rape and its consequences are shockingly audacious. Also, the actions taken by the townspeople "on behalf of" Belinda, whom they see as some kind of feral animal, are especially bleak. Johnny Belinda definitely belongs to the stunning Ms. Wyman. She really manages to capture the sensitive heart and soul of Belinda. But the picture is also notable for its stunning exterior shots, the landscapes which run down to the sea's edge, village streets, fishing boats and weathered barns look as though they might be indigenous to Cape Breton Island and they really give you the feel that you are actually struggling to live a hand-to-mouth existence along with these people.

I just "discovered" Jane Wyman a couple of weeks ago when I saw "All that Heaven Allows," another Wyman triumph. In "Johnny Belinda" she plays a lonely deaf woman who has never learned a way to communicate with the world. Then, along comes a lonely doctor who makes it his business to teach her. Of course, none of this goes unnoticed by the small town residents that surround them. The story is engrossing and moving, but really the film is worth watching for Wyman's wordless performance alone--she's really one of the best. Don't know how I avoided seeing her all these years but I sure plan on checking out any of her movies I can get ahold of. Also, Agnes Moorehead (who apparently made quite a few films with Wyman) gives another spectacular performance as Wyman's spinster aunt 
Jane Wyman's poignant, justly acclaimed performance as an isolated deaf-mute girl is the best thing about this old-fashioned 1948 Warner Brothers melodrama. Generally undervalued as an actress even though she bounced easily from sassy musical comedy chorines to long-suffering Douglas Sirk matrons, Wyman brings a touching authenticity to a character who through the kindness of a country doctor, finds liberation in her newly found ability to communicate. In what is probably his best film, director Jean Negulesco should be given credit for coaxing such a fine performance even though the actress at 34, is a mite mature for the role. The plot centers on kindly Dr. Richardson, who pays a house call to help deliver a calf for the irascible Black McDonald. There he notices Black's daughter Belinda, who is unable to hear or speak. Treated more like a mule by her family, she engenders the ridicule of the small town that refers to her dismissively as "The Dummy". The good doctor takes a platonic interest in Belinda and teaches her sign language and lip reading, and through the magic of Hollywood, she not only becomes adept but transforms into an attractive young woman curious about the world around her. There is a lovely scene where she watches the locals dancing, feels the resonance of a fiddle being played, and starts to dance as well. Unfortunately, she attracts the attention of Locky McCormick, a local ne'er-do-well who rapes and impregnates her. Scientologists will likely rejoice at the implied silent birthing scene. The film ends on a far-fetched, heavy-handed note, but the turn of events is not enough to ruin the movie. Longtime character actor Lew Ayres is a bit too passive and overly sincere as the well-meaning doctor, but one has to put some of the blame on the rather simplistic screenplay by Allen Vincent and Irma von Cube. Unsurprisingly, veterans Charles Bickford as Black and especially Agnes Moorehead as his taciturn sister Aggie are expert in their roles. Jan Sterling overplays the role of the doctor's smitten secretary, though Stephen McNally is appropriately despicable as Locky. Set in rural Nova Scotia, the townsfolk are portrayed in unfortunate broad strokes to reflect their small-mindedness, especially as they try to take the baby away from Belinda. The Mendocino coast provides a scenic replacement for Nova Scotia, and it's captured well in Ted McCord's crisp black-and-white cinematography. But see the movie for Wyman's masterful turn - that's really what keeps it from being dated hokum. The extras on the 2006 DVD are skimpy - the movie's original trailer and a vintage short released the same year, "The Little Archer" 
this is an absolute masterpiece. this film will definitely become permanently etched in your mind after viewing it. it will touch your heart and break your heart, but you will never forget it. Jane Wyman gives her absolute greatest performance and garners the oscar as a result. Wyman is also the prettiest little woman you'll ever see on film. an absolute angel in this movie. it is difficult to belive that this movie was released after her roles in such renowned classics as "The Lost Weekend" and "The Yearling". by the way she is still living. she was born in 1914. she would be 92 this year. as for the DVD, excellent picture and sound. no real extras. too bad. still worth the price 
This is an excellent movie.. I've had this movie taped from T.V for alot of years and when the vhs came out I was thrilled.. But I knew the DVD would be more fabulous. When I heard it was being released I couldn't wait to buy it. The picture quality is excellent and so is the sound. If you want an excellent old vintage movie, in my opinion this is definatly one to purchase and have for your collection!!.. Jane Wyman won and oscar for her performance and she deserved it!.... 
Many who have reviewed this near-masterpiece have neglected to say just how special this film was to 1948 audiences. Jane Wyman was known as the girl-next-door type, playing girlfriends and wives, but rarely taken seriously as a topnotch actress. Her one shot came with "The Yearling", as the stern, but understanding mother to Claude Jarmon, Jr. Her performance in "Johnny Belinda" was seen as a revelation, with her Oscar pretty much assured. The film itself garnered 13 Academy Award nominations, winning only the one for Jane Wyman. The DVD has a greatly sharpened picture - near perfect, in fact. But the sound is a vast improvement, not muffled as it was on the VHS tape, and certainly better than what was offered by Turner Classic Movies for years. However, for the most recent televised airing, the new restored version was used. The only disappointment is the lack of extras on the DVD. Somewhere in the vaults, there had to be more info about the making of the film or Oscar highlights. Get with it, Warner Brothers! 
It is easy to see why Jane Wyman, with her limpid eyes and winsome smile, won an Academy Award as a deaf-mute in this adaptation of the play "Johnny Belinda." The Academy is known for succumbing to characters with mental or physical afflictions ("The Snake Pit," "Rain Man," etc.) When she kneels beside the body of her father (Charles Bickford) and signs The Lord's Prayer, her Oscar was a secret even Price-Waterhouse couldn't keep. The temptation to cynicism, however, is unwise. The picture turns out to be quite affecting. Wyman and Lew Ayres, as the doctor who teaches her to communicate, do some of their best work in "Johnny Belinda." After the town bully (Stephen McNally) rapes Belinda, he and his wife (Jan Sterling) attempt to adopt the son (named Johnny) Belinda has by him. Director Jean Negulesco ignores the soap operatics and creates a rugged sense of place, an insular Nova Scotia seaside farming village. The black-and-white cinematography is invaluable here. The supporting cast is fine, and there are memorable touches everywhere. In addition to Wyman's prayer for her father, there's Bickford's pride in his blossoming daughter, and her responses to life's vicissitudes. Agnes Moorehead is the tart-tongued but quietly sympathetic aunt. And Sterling, in her first major role, does not disappoint. What does disappoint is the perfunctory DVD release Warner Bros. has given the studio's own movie, a big hit with audiences in 1948. 
Leonard Maltin gave this one ***1/2 out of **** and said it was a great film. Haven't seen it, but am prepared to buy it sight unseen because the story sounds interesting, it's universally admired, Jean Negulesco was a versatile and talented director and Jane Wyman and Lew Ayres were both terrific performers. Trivia - Greta Garbo after her early retirement once named Ayres as her favourite male co-star (The Kiss, 1929), an obvious dismissal of John Gilbert! 
I really liked this film. Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker. This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today. You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors. I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest. It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World. It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time. Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year). Moore in recent years has become a "political celebrity", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America. It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too. They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows. A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods. I don't know if Moore is like that or not. But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America. 
Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by GM's unhealthy cost structure. The company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney UAW sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it. Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
Leftist-Anti Establishmentarian Michael Moore is mad as hell and he's not taking it anymore as his smalltown America, Flint, MI has just lost 30,000+ jobs as greedy G.Motors Exects move plant to Mexico and put above mentioned thousands out of work. Moore does a good job of keeping the subject serious for a change. Other good Moore films included Fahrenheit 911 and The Big One. Others he's done get too far into his leftist politics which I am (far-political-middle/Populist) am not into. Good job here, Michael 
The film is a wonderful snapshot of the decline and fall of an American town. The scenes of parties for Flint's rich folks and GM executives, interspersed with poor workers being evicted from their homes, are great. I also loved seeing Reagan and hearing the Flint citizens talk about how he was going to bring the jobs back. This is the President who put our country on the road to bankruptcy. Moore wants to save his home town and help people in poverty. He's a sincere guy. I'm less convinced that the proposals he has in mind would accomplish anything. As I see it, the problem in Flint is not that GM is a bad corporate citizen, or that the government isn't doing enough to help the poor. The real difficulty is that Flint's prosperity in the 50s and 60s was an illusion to begin with. After the Second World War America chose to base its transportation system on the automobile. This seemed to work OK for a while, because gasoline seemed to be plentiful and cheap. Unfortunately, this approach to transportation had some nasty side effects. It made our towns ugly and our people fat, not to mention changing the climate. Today we're coming to the end of the era of cheap oil with the passing of Hubbert's peak. Oil comes from millions of years' worth of stored sunlight, and when it's gone, it's gone. In the next few decades getting around at all is going to become increasingly difficult. We'll be wishing that we had invested in streetcar lines and walkable cities instead of all those freeways. The automobile is still subsidized to the tune of billions of dollars in America today. That's just money down a rat hole. For more perspective on the dominance of the automobile in American life, I would suggest Kunstler's books "The Geography of Nowhere" and "The Long Emergency." I also highly recommend Shoup's book "The High Cost of Free Parking. 
what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke. I hated it 
I gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary. It falls more along the same fodder as "Spinal Tap". It is missing a counter point from GM. One could argue that Roger had chances to talk with Moore, but choose not to. One the other hand, Rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold. I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film. An interview would have killed the tone. Watch the nightly news NOW. Last night, March 22nd 2006, GM offered a one time buy out to some of it's employees. The news reported that GM cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW (Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film). This same thing happened in the late 1980's and brought forth this extremely biased movie. This film is entertaining in a strange way, but should not be considered to be the absolute truth. Watch it with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Under close examination, Careful consideration and Keen intellect, you will see a undercover message You might need to examine closely the content. Outwardly, things are not what they seem Until you look more closely. Many times the basic concept is Misread in the dialog Once you see this, and Open your mind to it, Rational thought will Emerge 
Michael Moore's first major film was one of his best in my opinion for two reasons. First off, since he did not yet have a trademark style, he did not try to go over the top in this film as much as he does in his subsequent efforts. He does his normal routine of tracking people down in an effort to embarrass them by asking them pointed questions, but for most of the film he lets the story and the citizens of Flint do the talking. As you probably already know, this is the story of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan, and the utter despair that fell upon it after GM began shuttering auto plants under the supervision of then CEO Roger Smith. The film really highlights how clueless Flint's elite are as to the suffering that all of this "consolidation" is causing. At one point in the film Moore is talking to some wealthy people at a party who seem to think they are doing the unemployed some kind of favor by hiring them to act as living statues at one of their fetes. When he asks the partygoers about what is going on in Flint they seem somewhat offended that there is such "negative publicity" circulating and say there should be more emphasis on the positive things going on in Flint - they name the symphony and the opera. Ah yes, let them eat opera glasses! The second reason I consider this film to be one of Moore's best is that even though this film was made in 1989, it is still interesting and relevant today. This is because the contrast between what average working people have to endure - the struggle to find secure jobs with decent benefits and their increasing vulnerability - and the desire of the captains of industry to improve the bottom line at any cost ... as long as it doesn't cost them ... has only worsened and deepened over the last 17 years since this film was first made. 
Documentary on the destruction of Flint, MI, with the closing of GM plants there and the laying off of 30,000 workers. Michael Moore is the filmmaker and Roger is Roger Smith, the head of GM at the time, whom he tries, without success, to interview on the tragedy at Flint. Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too. The movie goes on a bit too long and certain scenes seem to be there for effect only (for example, those with a woman who raises rabbits for food - we see her actually skinning one), but it's a good documentary nonetheless 
If you are you are reading this review, chances are it is from the privileged side of the digital divide. You're probably using a laptop at a cafï¿½. Maybe you're using your personal computer at work or at home. Not too far from you, there's a kid who laments their sheltered life. There's a James Dean or a Holden Caulfield who is confronting the numbing insanity of a prosperous American childhood. This kid is growing up a lot like I did, with a full belly and not much to do. They have out-of-touch adult authorities who enforce a dull reality. Just for a day, they wish they could go experience life on the street. They wish they could explore booze and cigarettes and all the other things they aren't allowed to do. They see kids at school who are less supervised. Those kids have so much more fun in life. This kid is depressed. Home does not meet their expectations, even if it fulfills their material needs. She feels trapped by not chasing her expectations of a rich and interesting life in clubs, drugs, and intimacy. Maybe he wants to find out what it's like to be addicted. Maybe she actually believe that parties exist like the ones they stage on sitcoms. Maybe he just stares at cool kids out his parents' minivan window and believes they have a better life. You need to find this kid and force them to watch Edet Belzberg's Children Underground. Why is it important for kids who grew up like I did to watch a documentary about homeless children in Romania? I'm not sure. The film has a way of sobering any fantasies about street life and addiction. I can't describe what it's like to see these children puff away at plastic bags filled with paint thinner as middle-class adults nonchalantly pass them. Kids of all ages puff away at cigarettes and cut themselves, but it's not rebellious. It's not "cool" or "Goth" or "Emo" or a cultural accessory to being "deep" or "thoughtful." It isn't "stupid" or able to fit within moralistic or social-Darwinist jargon. It is naked poverty and naked mental illness. All of the judgment and persona that American culture invests in poverty and illness seems to melt in the testimony of Romanian children. Perhaps this documentary is so moving because the "face" of poverty in American popular culture is adult and non-white. This is an illusion but it frames the way in which we think of social ills. Young, white preteens aren't supposed to live lives of drugs, violence, and homelessness. At least, we aren't supposed to see these lives. I'm pretty sure that there are kids in Chicago, New York, and Seattle whose lives aren't unlike those of these children in Bucharest. Maybe you and I step over them in the Subway without noticing. Maybe we see those eyes in the face of a young stranger and resolve not to do anything about it. Of course, not all good intention has good consequence. The film is also a critique of charities and social services that can be woefully inept at meeting the childrens' needs. Good individuals are undermined by flawed bureaucracy. Children Underground does not raise complex problems and placate the viewer with simple answers. One wishes the hardware store would stop selling the kids paint to snuff until they drool and spasm. One wishes the state would stop trying to place kids back in homes that they identify as abusive. One wishes that birth control was affirmed as a human right. Belzberg gives a glimpse of the human condition that undermines the way in which American culture relates to the body through commodity and desire. Like the best cinema, the subtext for the audience makes the main text profound. 
i think this movie, although depressing, was a good example of the survival instinct manifested in children. Maybe in some sort of perverted way i thought that these children would become expert in the ways of survival, and that this experience could be a positive in their lives as they got older. These kids were being knoked around early in life and this, hopefully, would only make them stronger granting them a true picture of reality and the dog eat dog lifestyle of capitalism. These kids are a model for the capitalist system that encourages a rugged darwinian individualism. A part of me wishes that I would have spent a few years on the street like these kids (sans the Aurolac if possible). If anything we should admire these children for their incredible innocent strength...this is urban primitivism and liberty at its best especially when contrasted with those fat and ugly pampered Bucharetians chillin' at Sydney's cafe... 
This powerful look at the utterly desolate lives of small band of Romanian street kids can be taken at face value as a condemnation of the policies of a brutal dictator. But it also speaks volumes about the realities of parents forced (by the Romanian government, in this case) to have unwanted children. The film can be divided into three acts. The first unflinchingly examines the children's daily lives in a subway station, begging for food, money, and water, and sniffing paint. The only upbeat aspect is the occasional joy that the children find in ordinary, childlike play-wading in a pond or playing tag. The second part reveals the dysfunctional families from which the children have either run away or been sent away. In one case, we learn that one of the boys is escaping an abusive father. He misses his sister but is too afraid of his father to even go near the house when a social worker tries to take him there. In another family, the mother has obviously shunned her son and daughter at the behest of her new husband. For me, the most heartbreaking scenes occurs here: A charity worker takes them home to see if the parents will take the children back, but the mother and step-father rationalize the kids' life on the streets; they can make more money there, they say. Then even this facade crumbles as it becomes obvious that the parents simply don't want the kids in their lives. The third part revisits the group after a gap of one year. We see that many of the younger kids have been taken up by charity organizations (which see them as having the best chance for rehabilitation), whereas the ending is not so happy for the older kids. This is a deeply saddening film but a must-see look at the misery created by a heartless government and irresponsible, thoughtless parents. This film and each of the children in it will stay with you forever. --MellowMonk.co 
I stumbled upon this movie at the public library. It looked interesting although the subject matter a little "dark". All I can say is I have never, ever been more riveted my a movie in my life. Sure you say, but for me it was true. I could barely breath or move through the entire course of the movie. What unfolded on screen was beyond belief. How could mere children become so hardened and disfugured by their circumstances? The life of the children portrayed is so horrific as to suspend belief in a sane world. The filmakers unflinching lense (how they could watch what was happening with these children and remained focused on thier work is amazing enough) and the films almost real time approach make these children's lives unfold in a most tragic way. By the end of the film you are left drained and shaken to your very core. What a world we live in. And God bless the children. You must see it 
Having just seen the DVD of Children Underground I must say strongly that this film should be seen by everyone in the postmodern first world. I saw these things for myself in Romania during December of 2000. The apathy on the streets of Bucharest was deep and dark. My friends there kept shrugging their shoulders saying; "What can you do?" A documentary on the thousands of dogs on the streets would be a riveting nightmare in itself. While I was there they held an election. The choice of presidential candidates was reduced to a hard-line old school communist and a new school fascist. The Communist won. People shrugged. The train stations and subway entrances were indeed hives for feral children. Im deeply grateful to Edet Belzberg for having the courage to descend into this manmade hell to bring these images back. It is my hope that the Romanians themselves find some of that same courage. I was moved that even at this stage of hell several of the kids held on to at least some idea of God. That could be seen by the cynically ironic of the West as the superstition of the hopeless, but perhaps it is also evidence that these children are not hopeless. To blame these problems on the lack of abortions or contraceptives is naï¿½ve and simplistic. Listen to the voices of the parents in this film. It is the apathy, the failure of courage and the utter selfishness reinforced by too many years of soul crushing communist dictatorship. We, ourselves, have no reason to gloat. Apart from having a surfeit of material possessions would we fare any better if the props were kicked from beneath us? Perhaps perhaps not. This film, along with Lilja 4-Ever, is a warning sign of something growing in this world. Robert L. Kaplan termed it The Coming Anarchy. It will spread. Meanwhile how will you respond to these things? With compassion or with apathy 
I have never seen anything like what is contained in this documentary. I am forever changed. I bought the DVD to be enlightened about "whatever it was" the film was about; I never thought it would have affected me the way it did. It can not be stated enough how imperative it is that people see this film 
CHILDREN UNDERGROUND follows a group of children living one subway station in Bucharest, Romania. These unwanted children exist as a result of Ceaucescus strict policy of outlaying abortions and birth control. Most grew up in orphanages while others lived with their families in dire poverty. They believe that their lives are better underground. This documentary films the daily exploits of these children along with the struggles they encounter to rehabilitate themselves. In order to attend school they must come clean and stop sniffing paint. In addition, they must have their identity papers, which are almost impossible for most of them. The most enduring parts of this film center on the interviews of the various family members of these children. Truly heartbreaking is the family of the small boy who doesnt understand why their youngest child wont return home. Watching this film will certainly make you appreciate the material things often taken for granted 
Clive Barker leaves one good horror series and starts another good one. Candy is a great horror movie with loads or gore and violence. The plot is good and we get to learn about Candyman and what he is like. This does deserve 5/5 stars, Tony Todd was terrific. 
WHen this film was release nationwide , I went to the theaters for a look back in the early 90's, I remember my experience watching it on the big screen, my friends and I got dizzy, it certainly hypnotized us. Fun, Freaky Film, watch it on a big screen t.v. in the dark, if you dont watch this frequently , you'll get some kicks out of it 
I'm not a big fan of cut-em-up horror movies. Usually I find them laughable and low-brow. Candyman, however, was a HUGE surprise! Sure, it's a gorey horror movie, but it's also a psychological thriller and yes, even a love story. I will have to say, on top of all that, it's also up there with one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. A great movie to watch, and a great movie to think about later. Definitely worth owning and re-watching, you'll notice more symbolism, allegory, etc in it the more you watch it 
Well made, well acted, Tony Todd is always good, he should do more of this type of movie. Virginia Madsen is also always good I wonder why she's not a big movie star? She certainly has the looks, figure and talent. I enjoyed this movie because the plot was very different and not run of the mill like most horror movies. Enjoy 
Candyman is a untique boogeymen and the story is great and all i have to say is to not go to a mirror and say his name five times..... Candyman is about a mythical guy that was ridcule by a bunch of towns people and they pour honey all over him and watch him get stung to death by bees.... The reason why the towns people did this was he fell in love with a woman.... The candyman is a great horror flick and its great to watch over and over again!!!!!! 
Actually I felt I was in love with this film as soon as I saw the very beginning - the opening credits against the background of Chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music. "Candyman" could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense, but Bernard Rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant, enchanting and spellbinding film out of it. If you're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won't find it here (you will, but not in quantities you used to). "Candyman" is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what's important, where mood is what matters, where you are given some food for thought. I don't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film, I can only say it's a great achievement of Bernard Rose as a director besides I guess Tony Todd, Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkeley had their best roles played in this feature. I don't personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre, but "Candyman" is a true gem which wouldn't be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times. By the way if you don't want to spoil your impression of the film, better don't watch "Candyman" parts 2 and 3. They ARE the average tenage urban legend flicks. 
I really have enjoyed watching the movie...three times already and I can say that it "tickles" your mind and think a lot of things at the end of it. Dont judge the book by its cover they say .... and its correct. 
A solid script backed up by a great cast, John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John c. McGinley, Alfred Molina, Amanda Peet and more, are all outstanding. Brilliantly directed by James Mangold who also directed Copland, Girl Intrerupted and Walk The Line, this is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. To say too much about the script would possibly give it away, but in the style of the Agatha Christie's novels 'Ten Little Indians' and 'Murder on the orient express', where people start dying in suspicious circumstances and later they find out they are all connected in some way. In this movie we have ten complete strangers stranded at a desert motel for the night. Sure enough people start getting killed, there is a lot of finger pointing and plenty of twists along the way to keep the audience engaged. The music score is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the whole movie. Special features include bonus trailers, an on the set documentary and 2 very informative and interesting commentaries. One by the director and one by the writer, the latter being the better of the two. The disc features both cinema and DVD versions, although the DVD version only includes 2 extra scenes that last no longer than 30 seconds each. The only fault I have of the movie is that it seems too much time was spent in the first half of the movie bringing the characters together and laying a foundation forcing the ending to seem rushed through to conclude the movie within the 90 minutes, instead of the film being possibly edited longer. All up though, one of the best thrillers you will ever see. I have seen it many times and it is still good even when you know the ending. 
A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear. Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around. It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release! Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing. Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make "Identity" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time. If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever. Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over. Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers 
There have many excellent reviews of this movie, therefore, I would only be going over what so many have already written about this wonderful film. What I will say, however, is that this is an excellent movie. This film is a great study in psychological suspense that keeps the viewer guessing as to who the killer is. Spoiler: When the 10 travelers converging at a motel on a rainy night begin to die one by one, and all in a mysterious, and supernatural type way, you begin to wonder if this is some kind of ghost story. On the contrary, we are all in the mind of a serial killer,[Pruitt Taylor Vince] and his split personalities are beginning to merge. The only way for him to succeed in becoming whole again is to discard the make-believe world that his mind has created. Therefore, we witness the killings that are perplexing, and yet real to the mind of this killer. John Cusack gives a good performance as the limo-driver, as does Ray Liotta as the policeman/escaped convict, and of course the role of the psychiatrist [Alfred Molina] trying to prevent the scheduled execution of the aforementioned serial killer, does an excellent acting performance as well. I highly recommend this movie. It is definetly different than many, if not most of the thrillers on the market today. 
My wife and I saw this movie on its opening weekend and both of us were blown away by the storyline and the acting. We've been Cusak fans for quite awhile (me since "Say Anything") and I have always loved Ray Liotta. The whole movie had this eerie, creepy feeling about it. The story does hold it's own, though it does "borrow" from two masters of mystery; Ms Agatha Christie and Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Once the "twist" comes in, even my wife (who figured out the ending to "American Haunting", "Silent Hill", "The Others") said "OH MY!" and we both bought the movie a couple days after it came out on DVD. The reason for the 4 star rating was that the "Extended Alternative Ending" added about 3 seconds-if that-to the trip in the van. SPOILER: I didn't really understand the basis behind most of the victims relation to each other, mainly the birthdates and the states their last names represented; but after watching it a couple times, it dawned on me. What easier way to make up identities for multiple personalities than to have similar dates of birth or names one can recognize (names of states). I do appreciate Cusak's roles nowadays, but I think he's being too typecast as a romcom star. Come over to Drama, Jon! It's a lot easier to win an Oscar or Golden Globe when you star next to Newman, Hanks, and are directed by Spielberg and Howard 
James Mangold Identity is one hell of a movie. The twist is amazing, didn't see that coming. The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film 
This is one of those 'little' films that sneaks under the radar. I was hooked from the start and amazed at the end. If mysteries and puzzles ala '6th Sense' are your forte, this is the film for you. CAUTION you must think to view this terrific film 
Even though the plot device of characters with split personalities or multiple personalities has been done before, Identity is at least clever with it. This is a really good movie. The movie goes like this: 11 people end up at a motel due to a bad rainstorm and flooding. Once there, the people start getting knocked off one by one. Think of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None meets Psycho. There's the former cop turned limo driver played by John Cusack, driving a self-centered movie star played by Rebecca DeMornay. The former prostitute trying to get to Florida to grow an orange grove played well by Amanda Peet. The young, newly married couple who are far from happy, played by Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott. A convict and the deputy escorting him to another prison. Played by Jake Busey and Ray Liotta respectively. The misogynistic hotel manager who has a couple of secrets.-John Hawkes An older married couple and their young son.-John C. McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Brett Loehr The events happening at the motel are cut in every once in a while by a late-night meeting going on between a psychiatrist and a judge and several other people. The psychiatrist's patient, Pruitt Taylor Vince, looks like Uncle Fester from The Addams Family and is about to be executed shortly after. The shrink is trying to convince the judge that his patient need not be executed. For most of the time watching the film, you don't understand what the people at the motel have to do with this other subplot. Some might be confused as to what the heck is going on, but the tie-in is pretty clever. Some spoilers below. The people at the motel are the 11 different personalities of the Uncle Fester dude that he developed because of years of abuse and neglect. One of these personalities is responsible for a murder rampage the guy went on, which is why he is on death row. The shrink is trying to convince people that he can get one of the personalities to kill the evil personality so Uncle Fester won't do anything else evil. The 11 are there to do battle but don't know it. The doctor eventually taps John Cusack's former cop limo driver, who signifies the strong, good but flawed personality, and tells him what he has to do. Problem is, more than one personality is bad, and it becomes a red herring fest to figure out who is responsible for the murders. It is oodles and noodles better than Twisted and Taking Lives and Hide and Seek and Secret Window and plenty of other thrillers that have come out in the past 5 or so years. But I guess this still isn't saying much is it? Anyway... Very nice way to spend a late night. 
It would never win an Oscar. Who cares?? A fun, spooky movie, kind of campy and fun. A great rainy-night movie, especially since it takes place on a rainy night. This movie was made to entertain, and entertain it does. Loved the twisty little ending. If you like Dennis Lehane novels, you might like this! Kind of a "Shutter Island" feeling to it. 
I once had this friend in high school, Suzy. She was the quiet little queen bee of ninth grade. Her parents had no idea that she snuck out of their home every night and returned every morning with her tousled, perfect curls still in order, undetected. Eventually her father discovered these midnight trysts and punished her by taking away her makeup for a week. I guess when you are living in a stale household, you are beautiful (and know it), and in need of some stimulation, you can always use your beauty as a weapon - just don't get caught. I loved the Virgin Suicide's character of Lux. Here is a girl, like "Suzy" who is bored with being gorgeous and decided to use it as a weapon to save herself from her 1970's life of "Not my Girls"- style parenting. Lux has beautiful sisters as well, but they don't have developed personalities and are more of a character in whole that sympathize with her. Lux is the queen bee and leader of this family pack of admired beauties. As a young teenager she is discovering the power of her own sexuality. Her curiosities about boys and the outside world away from her parent-controlled, sterile environment lead her to rebellious behavior and experimentation with the opposite sex. Lux is one of Sofia Coppola's more shallow female creatures discovering the thrills of her own charms. She is reminiscent of Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" in her young innocence and ability to indulge in the occasional lack of constant supervision. Lux and her sisters are desperate for some kind of change, a catalyst, someone to rescue them from their lives after losing one sister to suicide. They are in dire need of escape before they lose themselves in an ordinary life. I highly recommend this movie and also suggest: the new "Marie Antoinette" if you are interested in Sofia's continued progress on the exploitation of young , sexually blooming teenage minds allowed to run wild with self-abandon. It's easy to see Sofia's point when watching both films back to back - Dunst, as Lux or Marie Antoinette is still the same teenager-they are still using their young powers of seduction to tantalize and get what they want. One happens to be the queen bee of her high school, the other the queen of France - nonetheless, the same desperate girl in need of affection and attention. 
Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain. The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly. With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the like. Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew. After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence. The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides. Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
Sofia Coppola takes on conformity in a black comedy about a house of five young girls who are just trying to reach out and grow up in the world, if their parents would allow them. It is told through the watching, voyeuristic eyes of young boys who obsess over the girls mentally, emotionally, sexually, and even intellectually. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. There really isn't much I feel there is to say about it, as it is a pretty self-contained little movie. Coppola satirizes the clean warmth of suburbia without the self-indulgence of most artists dealing with conformity. I'm surprised by the cover descriptions and synopses that talk about this film as if it's a mystery; it's about as mysterious as what drives Charles Kane. However the "haunting lyricism" and "dark humor" aspects are pretty correct. It's a pretty good film. --PolarisDi 
Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!? Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false. Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible. But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!? The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night. Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!? It is not matching the character 
This is not just a film about teen angst altho it is that also; extremely so. But it is more so an allegory about how wrong our middle class American culture can go and how, horrifically, the American Dream can turn into a nightmare as much for the people who go on living it as well as for the titular suicides. I think James Woods and Kathleen Turner were excellent casting choices as the parents and both roles that were so out of type and yet fit so perfect that you have to wonder who was inspired to cast them. It hurts so bad to watch this movie but you can't help yourself because even though you're watching for the 5th time it still sucks you in and you really start to root for this family to pull it all together and save themselves. Every time you root with all your heart; every time 
The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material. The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it. One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed. Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator. The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film. I mean this guy did do Godfather, surely he could've given a professional's review of this? It's hard to say which film's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible 
The title of this movie holds no secrets. The Virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom. Almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic, between the acting and a great story line, but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions 
Boy meets girl. Girl thinks boy is a little weird but interesting. Boy is mildly taken with girl. They part with a classic kiss that screams spontaneity. They meet again under circumstances that they can't have each other and the girl doesn't know what she wants, she's just irritated by boy. I won't ruin the ending, but it's a good one. This has nudity in it; my husband thinks I watch it to see Julian Sands in the buff. He might be right 
This has to be one of the best romantic movies ever filmed. Merchant and Ivory were masters at period films. The music, acting, locations, costumes were first class. One of my favorite movie scenes of all times is the playful scene of the vicar and the two young men frolicking buck naked in the pond in the woods. I laugh out loud every time I see the movie. There are so many brilliant moments in this movie, I never tire of it. I've had the video for many years, so, I had to have the DVD 
When I watched this film for the first time several years ago, I thought it was mind-numbingly boring. Now that I've become a big fan of film adaptations and, more important, period pieces, I thought it would be fair to give this film a second chance. A Room with a View is a beautiful, passionate love story that keeps real to E.M. Forster's novel. This is the story of Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and the choices she has to make. Should she choose her boring, but socially approved fiancï¿½ Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis) or should she follow her heart and choose the adorable and passionate George (Julian Sands), whom she met during a trip to Florence, Italy? Should she settle for the demands and social mores of Edwardian England? The story is slow-paced and subtle. It focuses more on the decisions Lucy has to make. Some people may consider it boring. I, however, think it is one of the best love stories out there. The actors are all magnificent. Helena Bonham-Carter, Daniel Day-Lewis and Julian Sands are wonderful. The scenes where the men bathe naked at the lake is my favorite scene. Yes, there is explicit male nudity in this scene, but I like the fact that they show men frolicking in such an innocent way. I thought it was endearing and the acting wonderful. As for the rest of the cast, Judi Dench and Simon Callow are also great. The production is an eyeful. The wardrobe, sets, scenery (especially the scenes in Italy) and backdrop of the Edwardian period (this is not a Victorian, like other reviewers have said) are breathtaking. James Ivory and the BBC went all the way with the quality of the direction and production. This movie was released in 1986 and the DVD's digital remastering is excellent. It adds dimensions to this already beautiful film. If you love classic love stories and you're a period film enthusiast, I recommend A Room with a View. Only a true lover of the aforementioned things could appreciate this great film to the full 
See title; simply put, it's a charming film. Loved it - a very successful gift 
The mid-1980s was a banner time for E.M. Forster fans. Two of his novels, "A Passage to India" and this, "A Room with a View", were successfully and wonderfully adapted for the big screen. ("Howard's End" would come a few years later.) Forster had a genius for developing characters and for showing the awesome and sometime awful complexities that arise when people interract. James Ivory, thanks to a brilliant casting director, had the right actors to bring these characters to life on the screen: Helen Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Simon Callow, Julian Sands, Daniel Day-Lewis, etc. What this permitted Ivory to do was to focus on another equally important element in film making: to give us something beautiful to look at. The shots of a small Engish village, the lusty Italian countryside, the polish of an upper class English garden are nothing short of breathtaking. It enhances the romance, heightens the humor (especially when an English minister decides to skinny dip with a few parishoners in a hysterical scene), and convinces us that this was how life was for these remarkable characters. One of the Merchant-Ivory's best collaborations, this dvd also comes with some insightful commentary and a unique look at E.M. Forster's life. I recommend it highly 
This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. It's funny and beautiful, with a perfect cast. The music and the scenery is breathtaking. I agree with a previous reviewer, I can't think of anything that isn't perfect with this film 
This has always been a favorite movie of mine-- enchanting, visually stunning and superb acting. But I have to say, I think that the digital remastering takes some of that enchantment away. At least with the audio aspect. Actor's voices have lost the human richness-- esp the women's voices which sound higher pitched and slightly annoying. Even the music and sound effects sound a little "off." So, it was sadly less of an enjoyable, enchanting experience for me watching this version. That said, I still love this movie, so I'm giving it 4 stars (minus 1 for the bad remastering). But this is just my opinion, so feel free to take it or leave it. Cheers 
I love this movie. For my 15th Birthday, My mom ordered it for me:) The Video Store lost the order and it took them 6 months to get it to me on VHS. Does that tell you how long I have loved this movie!!! I know the movie word for word!! Most Men do not understand it, (it has no action, DUH!!). It does not need it! It is beautifully written and the background (Italy, etc.) is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a wonderful dream to fufill on day - To run through a barley poppy field dressed in a victorian dress and carring a parasol:) I love the way Helena says the word Constantinople. It will be my daughter's name. Also the costumes and Hair in the movie is incredable!! For my wedding I had the hair of the Italian driver's girlfriend. I am a long haired blond, so it worked out perfectly. Helena still and always will be my favorite British Actress. This movie moved my in many ways and I even after almost 15 years nothing compares to this movie in my opinion!! Enjoy!!!! If you are a romantic at heart let the romance take you away for a few hours: 
I would have given this film 0 stars if possible. This film was long, boring, and painful to watch. If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films 
I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young children, because of the nudity. 
Leave it to the Coen Brothers to make Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle the crux of a film noir, and darned if they don't make a good case for it in "The Man Who Wasn't There." (Typically, they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who can't even remember Heisenberg's name.) Chain-smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) makes the only decisive (and dishonest) action of his life, and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several, mostly not-so-innocent, bystanders. In "The Man Who Wasn't There," the phrase "decisive action" is an oxymoron; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance. Everything that happens--from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face--changes everything forever, and always for the worse. Set in 1949 in Santa Rosa, Calif. (a tip of the hat to Hitchcock and "Shadow of a Doubt," perhaps?) "The Man Who Wasn't There" looks perfect. Like every other Coen film, it's a marvel of production design, and the genius photographer Roger Deakins nails to a tree the dusty black-and-white look of such classic noirs as "Double Indemnity" and "Out of the Past." Thematically, however, "The Man Who Wasn't There" resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant, much better acted remake of Edgar G. Ulmer's "Detour," in which the characters drift in a low-rent Sartrean hell, totally the victims of fate. But whereas "Detour" is more than the sum of its parts, "The Man Who Wasn't There" is less. The Coen Brothers may believe in chance, but on the screen they leave nothing to chance, so that everything in "The Man Who Wasn't There" is TOO perfect. In the end the film has the same overstudied, clinical quality that afflicts every Coen film except "Fargo." (It must be admitted, though, that only one Coen film--"The Hudsucker Proxy"--is ruined by that quality.) The acting is as superb as in any Coen film. Thornton--in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together--burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense, hangdog gravity. There are also glittering supporting performances by Frances McDormand as Thornton's philandering wife Doris; James Gandolfini as her paramour and boss; Jon Polito as a shady businessman; Michael Badalucco as Thornton's motormouth brother-in-law; Scarlett Johansson as the teenager Thornton chastely fancies; and especially Tony Shalhoub, nearly stealing the picture as Freddy Riedenschneider, defense attorney extraordinaire. 
This is an excellent film. Billy Bob is a clean-vut barber who keeps to himself. His wife married him because she liked that he didn't talk very much. It is a tragedy of epic proportions, with great performances from all involved. The only thing for me that holds this back from being a FIVE STAR film is the fact that in EVERY SINGLE SCENE someone lights up a cigarette or is taking deep drags on one. That alone justifies this film's "R" rating. When watching this film, it seems that they are encouraging people to be "cool" and that smoking is a pleasurable thing. The most notorious moment for me is when Frances McDormand is sitting in the bathtub and asks her barber husband (Billy Bob) to shave her legs. He walks in somberly with a cigarette drooping from his lips and she tells him to give her a drag. This is a putrid moment that just drove me crazy! But then, that is just my opinion. Overall, the film could have been as good and greater if it did not have the incessant smoking throughout. The plot is slow yet intensely emotional. If you don't mind smoking, then you will probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy. If you are as strongly opposed to smoking or have children who are interested in seeing this, you should review the film before letting them see it 
I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment. 
Other reviewers consider this move the Coen Brothers' best. Before viewing this film I had seen only "Miller's Cossing" and "Fargo". I still prefer Fargo but acknowledge that this movie is a special kind of masterpiece. With few exceptions, I usually do not like films based on unsympathetic characters (one reason I prefer "Fargo"). However, this film's exclusive assortment of unlikeable and unprincipled chaqracters creates the perfect springboard for the unintended chain of violent consequences resulting from a opportunistic premeditated act of revenge by a bizzarely laconic barber, all of which are meant to illustrate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The excellent acting of the cast gives depth to otherwise banal characters in such a way that suggests that they could have been different has they chosen otherwise. I didn't particularly like the convenient and superfluous inclusion of UFOs in the storyline and thought it unnecessarily weakend an almost flawless plot line. The behavior of the teenage girl at the end of the story was too abrupt and, in general I felt that the significance of her character should have been better developed. 
While the Beethoven-heavy score plays, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) intones, "Yeah, I worked in a barber shop. But I never considered myself a barber." A perfect opening line for one of the Coens' greatest movies. Ed has resigned himself to cutting hair and living with his distant wife Doris (Frances McDormand), who is having an affair with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini). When an opportunity opens up involving dry cleaning, Ed decides to try to control over his destiny and ends up being punished for this, in the finest film noir tradition. As usual from the Coens, this is a darkly comic, cleverly plotted noir, but the unusual for the Coens (aside from the voice-over narration and the gorgeous black and white cinematography) is the depth of feeling in this movie. Although a cipher to everyone around him, Ed is, to the viewer, a decent guy who simply doesn't belong in his life. It's impossible not to feel empathy for this guy. This entire movie bears his essence, from the methodical, deliberate plotting to the smoky, restrained black and white. The Coens have really thought this one through, and the result is marvelous. Clearly not for everyone, but Thornton's depiction of disaffected alienation is brilliant and not to be missed for fans of the Coen Brother 
This may be the best Cohn brothers' movie yet. Stellar performances by all, and a plot that contains no loose ends adds up to a great nouveau film-noir flick that shows what could happen when an unsuspecting man starts to travel down the wrong road. The ending is almost transcendant. This is the kind of movie Albert Camus might have made if her were a film writer and director. 
I think you have to see this movie a second time to fully appreciate it. There is alot of subtlties that I didn't pick up on until I watched it again years later. All the acting was fantastic. A standout performance for the actor who played the "salesman" at the hotel. Weird-a-rama!!! The movie ends up being completely freaky and surreal, and ya got to have a warped mind to fully grasp the surrealness of the Coen Brothers. Strange-a-rama......... 
This review is for the 2002 Universal DVD. The story is set in the late 1940's, where a small town barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) concocts a slick blackmail scheme targeting his cheating wife Doris (Frances McDormand) and her boss 'Big Dave' Brewster (James Gandolfini). After the payoff, Big Dave figures out that Ed set him up and a violent fight ensues where one of them is murdered. The cops arrest of the wrong person and a big city lawyer named Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Schalhoub) is hired to defend the accused. This sets up the rest of the film for plenty of unexpected twists and turns along with a lot of subtle comedy. The Coen Brothers now have a long resum of wonderful films and this by far my personal favorite since there are many things that work brilliantly in this movie. First, the black and white cinematography strikingly captures the mood and feel of a late 1940's film. Second, the deadpan narration and stoic body language by Billy Bob Thorton is mesmerizing. Third, the attention to detail of the props, decorating and fashion styles is done to perfection. Fourth, the plot is slick and original. Finally, the comedy is as dark as the dead of night, but works magically in this bizarre and macabre atmosphere. I enthusiastically recommend this film - especially if you enjoy old film-noir flicks. The DVD widescreen black white presentation is superb, as it should be, since the movie was shot in 2001. There are many bonus features including commentary by the director Joel Coen and actor Billy Bob Thorton. Movie: A+ DVD Quality: A 
The Man Who Wasn't There is a movie by the always unpredictable Coen brothers. Their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it's fun to see what they've come up with next. Out of the ones I've seen, my thoughts are mixed. I mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like Raising Arizona, then one of the best movies of all time with Fargo and then go terribly wrong from there? Then you've got the Big Lebowski, a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness. Not what I call a good movie. Then there's the Ladykillers, a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything. So they're just getting worse by age, right? Wait! Let's go back two years to 2001. It was in this year that this unheard of movie was made. Of course, its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle. And that's the beauty of this gem. The cinematography. The look of this world and the 1940s feel it's good is brilliant. But it's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own. It is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others. But first, let's talk about the plot of the movie. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) is living in California in the 40s with his wife, Doris (Frances McDormand). Doris is part of a community that talks and talks. But not Ed. Ed narrates this story...his story. He sees it in black and white or maybe that's the way it really is. You've got to think. Ed is a barber and is proud of his job. He only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration. So here, there is some more originality, brilliance and beauty. When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini), he reacts with harshness. He blackmails Big Dave but something goes wrong. Big Dave finds out and Ed kills him out of defense. And this all happens in the first 30 minutes. Doris is accused of doing it and from then on, you're in for a real treat. When Ed isn't narrating, like I already said, he isn't talking. So what he does is smoke, cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed Birdy (Scarlett Johansson) play piano. Her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty. Tony Shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider. He's a big shot who talks and talks. Keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the "you don't know" repeated a bunch of times. Believe me, you'll know when you're hearing it. The movie is a sad and tragic tale, a tale showing how badly one man's life can go in a world that isn't for him. He's different. It's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one...he stands out because he's different. The Man Who Wasn't There is hands down an excellent movie. It is a close second to Fargo in the Coen's movies. My last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves. This movie is rated R for a scene of violence? Is that a joke? That scene was in black and white and showed NOTHING! You people really have no idea what you're doing. Pulp Fiction (R)=The Man Who Wasn't There (R) Get it straight people, your ratings are horrid. James Bond flicks have worse content than this. 
This movie is a must have for all family libraries. It appeals to adults and youth alike. A true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside, no matter what our outward differences are. Really teaches the lesson, "Don't judge a book by its cover". 
I bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me. I enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also. Times and styles may have changed, but I believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did. Simple, but great movie. My only regret is that it wasn't close captioned 
I dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980's or have gone to school in the United States but I can still relate to this movie. This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied. Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities. It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB. A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic. 7.5/1 
This movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different. This is a comming of age film for the 1980's. The acting is wonderful. It is a different style of movie. There were some really great movies comming out then. Ferris Beulers Day off, Pretty in Pink and some kind of wonderful. This is another one. It is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time. The 1980's is a time I was fond of. I do not find it tacky as the media is right now. This movie is funny. Some of these classics get refered to in other movies. You might want to watch it 
Smooth and easy transaction - my daughters thank you, too 
John Hughes strikes gold with this hit classic.This film is about five kids who show at their high school for Saturday detention.While there,they open up to each other and express their feelings,putting up with each other and evading their wily principal(Paul Gleason).High-strung humor and laughs blend with superb storytelling as The Breakfast Club(Starring Judd Nelson as Bender,Molly Ringwald as Claire,Ally Sheedy as Allison,Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,and Emilio Estevenz as Andrew)are hillarious!A pleasant all-around film 
I love John Hughes and I love the brat pack, and I have to say this movie is WAY better than all of the others. And it's not just those who graduated in the 80s who haven't seen this movie who're locked in a cave, but ANYONE who has not seen Club is culturally deprived and should seek help imediately 
On a June evening in 1968 I was awakened by my dad, a Marine Raider and one of the Chosen Few, at ten o'clock PM, that's 2200, to watch The DI... five hours before I was to report to the Armed Forces Induction Center, Oakland, Calif. I won't ever forget that movie session with my dad, and as one other person commented, ya never forget your DIs, mine were SSgt Gonzales, SSgt Rogers, and Cpl Sexton. Great movie, Jack Webb is still the DI, sorry R. Lee, gotta go with tradition here! Sure would like to see this on DVD, but for now I'll settle for the VHS... I bought two copies, one for me and one for a friend! Semper Fidelis to all the Brothers and Sisters! Pau 
All I can say is amen to the rest of the reviews on this great movie!! and Agree wholeheartly to the question raised by almost everyone, "Why hasn't this movie as well as a few others been released on DVD" I am also a marine VET, the attention to detail to this movie made so long ago "1957 I believe" is superb for the time it was released. I have a vhs copy and only wish I could get it on DVD also. 
I just like to say this is the best marine movie of all time i cant believe its not on dvd if someone knows how to get it on a dvd it would be a top seller i would buy five of them in case they stoped producing this movie again lo 
If you are interested in basic training type films than this is the movie for you. You can watch this film with your family, it's nothing like Full Metal Jacket or some of the others. I only wish it was a DVD release. Buy it, you will really enjoy it.. 
Here's a message to Hollywood. There are perhaps a million former Marines out there that will buy The D.I. on DVD as soon as its released. I saw The DI as a 12 year old on television in 1960. I was petrified by the movie and never thought I'd join the Marines because of it. Well, in 67 I did join and went through bootcamp in San Diego, almost within sight of my house. I think Full Metal Jacket is more realistic but doesn't deliver the positive message served up in The DI. Webb does a magnificent job depicting the stoic drill instructor. The intensity of the training in bookcamp, the concern for details (as depicted in the breaking down and reassembly of an M1) that make up a recruits world are dead on. The DI is a classic. Like other reviewers before me I find it puzzling that this film hasn't made the transition to DVD when so much garbage has. But then Hollywood and the people that populate show biz haven't a clue about being a Marine. Its been almost 40 years and I still remember the names of my drill instructors. Sgt. Alley where are you? Semper Fi 
Brings back the days of going through USMCRD h*ll, which was also some of the best days of my life now that I look back. It's an absolute crime that this hasn't been officially released on DVD, along with R. Lee Ermey's "Boys of Company C." Why these films have been resigned to sitting in dusty VHS out-of-print shelves, while other cra*py films have already been released two or three times on DVD in various special, super-special, or ultra-super-special editions is beyond me. As for the film itself, if you know the drill at all, get this movie. You'll love it. It will bring back a flood of memories, most you'll cherish, most will motivate, and most will resonate with you long after the movie is over. Jack Webb does an amazing performance...nails the SDI perfectly. Can't recommend highly enough. Semper Fi brothers 
My father was in the Army from 1966 to 69. He lost most of hearing due to noise from being a hawk missile launcher. He is always asking me to get this movie for him. I don't buy it only because it is not in caption, and he will not enjoy the movie without the captioning feature with his impairment. This movie is simply a war classic. It should be out on DVD without question and have captioning feature for the hearing impaired like my father. Just look how much the VHS are selling for used. On eBay the price is even more sometimes. 
No-nonsense Marine boot camp flick. Jack jump-starts confused recruits. Especially rewarding to those viewers who know the drill. 
I went through boot at MCRD San Diego in 1954 and first saw this film just after it came out. Webb's attention to detail was amazing. The romance angle left something to be desired, but the scenes on base caught the spirit of boot camp and are probably not too far off now. I have it on VHS from TV but really would like it in DVD 
This film having been produced in 1957, was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a D.I. AT P.I. It showed for two consecutive nights and I think every D.I. on P.I. somehow arranged to see it. We wanted to see if they got it right I guess. I viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic. A most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times. I highly recommend it 
George Roy Hill's film has its excitements and it claims the fashionable climactic bloodbath, but mostly it's played for fun... It's a highly individual Western; a triumph of style, in fact... The style is dominant, intelligent, flowing with charm; the playful teasing, and Newman supplied with a hat on a bike, and the contemporary lyrical Bacharach pop tune... It's a style that flowers in the Newman-Redford relationship, which is one of the most affecting in movies... All this gives it the feel and look of fanciful myth carried to a point unusually removed from reality... Backgrounds are sketched rather than etched... You are never really moving toward the west in time and place... With belief suspended, feelings are only light1y involved... But it's derring-do at its most flamboyant and given a tangy taste by its essentially modern sense of humor... When Butch and Sundance ride back from relaxation to their Hole-in-the-Wall lair and find they have a mutiny on their hands--Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) wants to take over--Butch doesn't quell it with bullets but with a boot up Logan's backside... It's that kind of picture... Similarly, when too much dynamite scatters the haul from a rail hold-up, this is a moment for wry, amusing comment... And when the posse pursues the pair this is one posse that 'heroes' can't easily shake off... It's always there, cleverly made more irksome by long-shot, so that finally only a 'death defying leap' as the circuses say, can separate hunted from hunters.... "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is undoubtedly a captivating tour de force... Its flavor is preserved from cloying by just the right edge of wistfulness provided by Katharine Ross as the schoolteacher girl-friend who goes along and who suggests the transience of it all... Newman and Redford good-natured fellowship is felt from the opening to the final scene... Sundance seems closer to the traditional Western character... He is strong, silent, willing to face confrontations and shoot it out... Butch is an atypical outlaw, enormously charming and courteous, has never killed anyone, and tries to avoid showdowns... Throughout the film, Newman is engagingly spontaneous in his expressions, gestures and timing of dialog...While Sundance is practical, Butch is a hopelessly ridiculous optimist and romantic dreamer... While they flee the posse, he continually expresses optimism, but beneath is a child-like need for reassurance... Small indications of his self-awareness emerge at other times, undercutting his casual exterior... For instance, despite the naturalness of the mï¿½nage-ï¿½-trois, Butch is really the outsider, and he knows it... In the lovely still-photo montage of their New York holiday, Butch watches with wistful longing as they dance, but then smiles--aware of his isolation but content in their happiness... "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture... It won four (Cinematography, Score, Song, and Original Screenplay). 
A great film however if you are going to promote the DVD as widescreen at least make it widescreen and not standard format 
... you may want to give this one a go. I'm amazed to realize that it's 37 years old; I think this film is going to end up among the classics when it gets a little older. I'm not a big Western-watcher at all. But I end up watching this one when it's televised because the cinematography is marvelous. It's what I loved when it first came out (I'm revealing my age) - that and William Goldman's screenplay. For those reasons, even if you don't care for shoot-em-ups, it's worthwhile 
Butch and Sundance is an amazing wonderful film: in this ultimate collectors edition it sparkles like a beautiful jewel. The package is complete (I always thought the 1997 version was missing William Goldman's commentary - this one has it!): if you were a fan of this terrific western when it first appeared in the first flush of 1969-70 you will not be disappointed to revisit with Butch and Sundance and their hole in the wall gang. Its also a great chance to listen in again as 3 beautiful stars and countless other key personnel recount what it was like to put this wonderful film together. God bless Geo. Roy Hill et al for making this western and changing many of our lives in the process. For this formerly 11 year old boy, I left the theater determined to be a film director. I studied writing by reading and re-reading Goldman's original screenplay over 40 times. When I finally got a chance to shoot film, of course I experimented with sepia tones! This is not the most coherent review I've ever slapped together but it makes up for coherence by being heartfelt. If you haven't seen Butch (and I know a lot of film scholars who haven't) you really don't know film. This is a classic film from several key players who have made their share of immortal classics. And the best part is, its not a bitter pill to swallow. This one tastes good going down! note: this review is for the 2 disc version, although the special edition released a few years back is also a wonderful buy. no matter how much Butch you want in your life, they are both worthy editions. In general, anything by Redford or Newman is well worth watching (when its penned by Bill Goldman, you're in for a special treat!) . 
It amazes me how incredibly well this 1969 western has held up after all these years. At once classically structured and satirically executed, director George Roy Hill and screenwriter William Goldman have pulled together a supremely entertaining period picture that caters to contemporary sensibilities to this day. It is to their credit that the film remains true to the characters and never gets too broad during its quickly paced 110-minute running time. The story naturally revolves around the legendary outlaws who robbed banks at the turn of the last century. Their escapades are divided roughly into three sections in the film. The first is the introductory set-up where their opposite yet complementary personalities are established. Leading the motley Hole in the Wall Gang, they ultimately pull off a train robbery with an excess of dynamite. The second part is an extended chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are chased relentlessly by a group of unknown bounty hunters. The third and final part details their escape to Bolivia where they are determined to go straight but get caught up with local bandits and find their infamous past catching up with them. It seems inconceivable to have anyone other than Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the title roles. As the more established star at the time, Newman is characteristically laconic as Butch. His innate likeability is enhanced by his rascally manner and crack comedy timing. In the more traditional gunslinger role, Redford provides the ideal partner with his flinty manner and unavoidable charisma. In between them is Katharine Ross, fresh from "The Graduate", who plays Etta with sensual ï¿½lan, though she does not figure in the most critical scenes. Of course, Burt Bacharach's instantly recognizable musical score is here, and while there is an anachronistic feel to such 1960's-sounding pop music over a western, it somehow works because the attitude of the film seems so modern. Even the comically romantic bicycle sequence manages to preserve its buoyancy thanks to the inane but undeniably catchy "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head". Conrad Hall's vibrant, burnished cinematography deserves special mention as it has been preserved well in the 2006 Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD package. The rest of the two-disc package is robust though bordering on overkill, adding on to the features that were already included in the previous 2000 Special Edition DVD. Retained from that edition is the interesting combination of perspectives provided by Hill, Hall, lyricist Hal David and associate producer Bob Crawford in their joint commentary track. New is separate and equally insightful commentary from Goldman. Another holdover from the previous edition is the forty-minute vintage documentary, "The Making of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid", a still terrific featurette from 1970 with participation from Newman, Goldman, Hill and Redford. There are three new documentaries - a 2005 retrospective look at the film called "All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"; a fact-check featurette called "The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch Sundance"; and the somewhat repetitive "History Through the Lens: Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time", a cumulative effort which combines elements of all the other documentaries into one ninety-minute feature. Lots of great insight is provided on the 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Goldman and Bacharach. A deleted scene is also included with Hill's commentary (since the audio had been lost) - it is a disposable transitional scene where Butch and Sundance are watching newsreel footage of themselves in a Bolivian theater while Etta quietly leaves to the train station. Lastly, there are trailers for eight of Newman's vintage films. This is definitely a robust package for one of the great films of the 1960's 
Director George Roy Hill (The Sting), paired two kings, Redford and Newman, in what film critics assert as the best "buddy" picture of all time, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"..Ironically, Robert Redford was rebuffed as bonafide to play Sundance..Newman didn't cotton to a minor-league stage actor, Redford, better known for "barefootin in the park" with Jane Fonda than for silver screen presence to play The Kid, or Newman was "going south", not to Bolivia, but on to other projects..The part was passed around Hollywood like after dinner bon bons, and rejected by luminaries such as Steve McQueen, Warren Beatty, and more surprisingly, Marlon Brando..Hill lobbied hard and often for Redford and convinced Newman to trust the newcomer, and as a closing caveat guaranteed Newman the choice dialogue from the script..Imagine today, anyone besides Redford playing the laconic, nebbish part of Sundance, the quickshot beta, to Butch's quickwitted alpha..Newman and Redford clicked beautifully as the "banditos yanquis", and Redford's starship subsequently went galactic..Henceforward, the only trains Redford (Sundance) robbed were the ones at the studios..Newman and Redford became beer buddies on the set, and Newman appreciated that Redford respected his stature in the biz, much like Sundance respected Butch's back at the "Hole in the Wall"..Butch and Sundance knew viscerally, the West was phasing from black and white into a more colorized, mechanized century, and reckoned their days were numbered as horse-back mounted train-robbers, to wit: the telegraph easily outran the best bred horses..And, one night while laying up in a bordello after a fresh kill, they spyed the future, the bicycle, being hawked by a hardware salesman on the town square as a replacement for the horse..Butch had to have one!..And in the most unusual scene in the film, Butch rides Etta Place around on the handlebars, to the tune of a hoarse and bug-ridden B.J. Thomas singing "Raindrops keep falling on my head, and just like a guy whose feet are too big for his bed"..Well, you get the picture..Not your daddy's Oldsmobile 
First off, let me state up front that I have been remiss in my reviewing duties. It's just that I haven't really found anything over the past few months that excited me enough to write about it here for you, the Amazon readers who may rely on the guidance of a twenty-six year old grocery store employee who would like to be the next Nick Hornby or P.J. O'Rourke. I apologize for my tardiness. Secondly, I love this movie. I first saw it a few months ago as part of my Film class's critique of traditional Hollywood genres and how they have been tweaked over time. Needless to say, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" provided the perfect example of this: what Western would have the heros run away from the law, much less take time to ride a bike accompanied by an insipid (but inspired) pop song? "Butch Cassidy" is everything that is right about the big-budget Hollywood film: star performers who don't mangle the material with their egos but rather play with the conventions of what they're supposed to do, all under the watch of a talented if not well-known director, as the screenplay marries the real history of the notorious outlaws with the liberties of a real shoot-'em-up Western. I loved this movie so much, I ended up doing a scene analysis of the second hold-up as my final project for the class. And got an "A", of course... So now we have the special-edition version, presented in widescreen and clear and crisp as the day it was first shown in American theaters in the fall of 1969. Paul Newman and Robert Redford carry the film through their obvious chemistry, and "Brokeback Mountain" jokes aside, they make the perfect bickering couple for this rollicking trip through a not-so-familar Old West. The film also features some top-notch work from Katharine Ross (Elaine from "The Graduate") as the woman they share (no, not onscreen at least), Strother Martin as the one man willing to give the outlaws a straight job (and gets shot by bandits for his trouble), and the world's unluckiest employee of Mr. E.H. Harriman (whose superposse symbolizes the modern times that catch up with Butch and Sundance even in Bolivia). I haven't gotten into all the special features yet, but I recommend the commentary by Goldman (who is rightfully proud of this film). Also, the "History Behind the Lens" documentary is interesting and (at ninety minutes) a treat for history buffs who want to see not only how the film differed from the story, but how often it got it *right*. The theatrical trailers are interesting nuggets from a time when Jerry Bruckheimer hadn't ruined movies with achingly slow pans and close-ups set in dramatic lighting with overbearing orchestral scores...or Tom Cruise shirtless. And "All of What Follows Is True" gives us more recent interviews with the principal cast still around (Newman, Redford, and Ross). All in all, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an impossibly giddy mix of drama and comedy set against the backdrop of a dying breed (the Western outlaw) and the last days of the frontier (not in North America, but South). Yes, there are problems with the film, but the overall effect of the piece leaves audiences satisfied that they took the journey. And it doesn't hurt that Redford and Newman are enjoying the hell out of the work they're doing, which shows through to the audience. It may be a cliche, but "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" still delivers. If only all Westerns could be this good.. 
On the first disc and carried over from the previous special edition is an audio commentary by director George Roy Hill, lyricist Hal David, documentary director Robert Crawford and cinematographer Conrad Hall. This track provides a history of the production with plenty of anecdotes. The participants give the lowdown on every scene on this very informative track. Also included is a new commentary by screenwriter William Goldman. Goldman points out that westerns are about confrontation and yet Butch and Sundance spend most of the film running away. This is an excellent track as Goldman doesn't just talk about the film but the state of cinema now as well as the business side of things. There is a "1994 Documentary: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" sees Hill, Goldman, Newman and Redford narrating over behind-the-scenes footage as they tell the story of how the film was made with clips from the movie that is an unconventional approach but works well. The second disc starts off with a new retrospective documentary entitled, "All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." This is an excellent look at this important film with new interviews with principle cast members even if there is some repetition from the 1994 doc and the commentary tracks. "The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch and Sundance" gives a historical perspective and provides insight into who these infamous figures really were. Various historians talk about the origins of their nicknames and examine how authentic the film is to the actual history. "History Through the Lens: `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: Outlaws out of Time'" is another look at the movie and compares it to the historical record. It also examines how Butch and Sundance are classic anti-heroes and how the film reflected the social and political climate of the late 1960s. "1994 Interviews" with Newman, Redford, Ross and Goldman. They talk about the movie and their experiences working on it. This is nice inclusion but nothing you really can't get from the numerous other docs on these two discs. "Tent" is a deleted scene with optional commentary by Hill and features Butch, Sundance and Etta going to see a movie about them. They comment on how inaccurate it is to what they really did and who they are. The studio felt that the scene was contrived. Hill says that he felt that it didn't work and it was rightly cut. "Production Notes" is a collection of memos to the studio outlining character development and the importance of certain scenes and script changes. "The Films of Paul Newman" is a collection of trailers from a few of his movies. "Alternate Credit Roll" features a different look and music to the end credits. Finally, there are three theatrical trailers 
If you are a Robert Redford fan this movie is by far his best. It's not Paul Newman's best work, but he is good. Katherine Ross is one of the sexiest actresses of the time. This movie starts fast and never stops. Also Jeff Corey keeps it real 
"Beautiful Girls". What a fantastic opportunity for lovers of Broadway musicals to see the behind the scenes creation and making of a successful musical in four days. This film is in part documentary combined with hi-lights of the finished performance at Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic. The story line of "Beautiful Women" attending a Follies Reunion so many years into retirement is powerful and awakens thoughts of aging. Mandy Patinkin, Carol Burnett, Barbara Cook and Lee Remick lead an all star cast in this Steven Sondheim Classic. You might want to view this film more than once. 
True...this is not "the best" documentary film ever made, although it IS pretty darned good, and part of the criticism may come because most of us who would want to see this would be just as happy with just one long uncut take of the concert on film...but we do have that on CD (thank goodness!). And what a concert it was!!! This is as near a dream cast as one could hope for. Of course there will be be endless quibbling over that opinion, and endless comparisons to the OBC...that's the glory of theatre...many opinions. But the overall arc and energy of this concert is amazing and that cannot be disputed...the CD is a classic... and one of those rare few "I wish I were there" events captured on recording. That said, the documentary does offer delight in the backstage glimpses it gives, especiallly after several (hundred? thousand?) listenings to the CD. For instance...I went into this already worshipping and adoring Barbara Cook (for me there can be no other Sally Durant), but after watching, I was really hooked onto Lee Remick too. And there were lots of discovery moments like that because of the documentary...so it did indeed, bring me someplace that the concert CD alone did not, and for that I truly value this DVD. So, perfect? No. (And franky, what is?) But it is worth watching and re-watching, especially if you are a total Follies junky, or learning to become one. How many other backstage stories can you say that of? For me, darned few...this one's a keeper. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
This is by far my favorite musical, not the concert but the actual musical from the 70's. When i saw Alexis Smith the first time i fell deeply in love. Of course i was only 24 at the time.Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls.. The likes of this will never come again 
Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title 
Thank God that there is a full recording of this evening available on CD, because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert. Granted, they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from Stephen Sondheim. This is truly a Broadway event. The documentary, which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun, but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin. We who adored Sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety 
This is not "Follies in Concert," it is the reader's digest version. Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably "Waiting for the Boys Upstairs" and "The Road I Didn't Take." While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape. Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half. In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable. All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers 
Religious and artists' lives have not fared particularly well in films, both being more interior than outwardly evident. Fred Zinnemann's The Nun's Story is the exception, certainly in American films, as it charts the life of Gabrielle Van Der Mal, who becomes Sister Luke, a nursing nun in Belgium and later in the Congo. Her gradual alienation from the religious life to one more secular is brilliantly conceived. This is achieved in Zinnemann's stately direction but also in the Robert Anderson script, drawn from Kathryn Hulme's book. There will probably never again be a cast of women as extraordinary as here. Audrey Hepburn had the finest role of her career as Sister Luke. Add Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft, Mildred Dunnock, Colleen Dewhurst, Beatrice Straight and Ruth White, all giving exceptional performances. Lastly, Peter Finch's role here as Dr. Fortunati, put him on the international map and began a string of fine performances for the rest of his career. This is essential viewing for those interested in how Hollywood once produced fine and intelligent work 
Audrey Hepburn is one of my favourite movie stars her portrayal of a nun is wonderful.We are taken into the world behind the convent walls to follow her journey to becoming a nun with all it's challenges to the decision to remain a nun or join the resistance. 
The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it should be taken as a historical piece and not indicative of the life of many if not most nuns today. Yes, there are still cloistered nuns that follow the strict rules of silence depicted here. However, for example, the hospital nun who visited my mother as she was dying lived in her own apartment in town, didn't wear a habit, and seemed to me to be much more interested in the people she was serving than in following onerous rules of piety. That said, 'The Nun's Story' certainly comes in among the 1000 best movie ever made. It is a very powerful drama, with flawless performances by the main characters. In most ways, it fairly accurately depicts the pre Vatican II Catholic Church. Since Vatican II, a lot has changed, and this change is spotlighted by this film when comparing Sister Luke's life with that of most nuns today. In a lot of ways, Sister Luke's convent was similar to the Pharisees so vividly depicted in Scripture. They were so concerned with following every letter of the Law that they failed to perceive and serve the real, everyday needs of the people. They were so focused on serving God that they forgot that Jesus said that 'if you have done it to the least of these (people), you have done it to Me.' This is not to suggest in any way that the sisters were not really sincere in their desire to serve God; indeed, their desire, and the sacrifices they willing made, needs to be admired. I think Sister Luke would have made it as a nun today. Of course there are still rules and disciplines that need to be observed. But, as Jesus told the Pharisees, if a cow is stuck in a pit on the Sabbath, you forget the rules about only resting on the Sabbath and help the distressed cow. If Jesus thought that about a cow, how much more so can the 'rules' be broken to serve another human being in distress? It is purely this dichotomy that distressed Sister Luke so much that he eventually had to leave the convent. She was there to serve the needs of people, hurting people, not to follow endless rules to the letter. She complained that the Convent expected that a sister counseling a lady who, for example, really needed comforting as she was dying, had to forsake the patient at the tone of the bell tolling silence. Sister Luke couldn't reconcile the emotional affliction of that woman with the perceived benefits of silent meditation. The whole movie is full of conflicts like this. At one point. Sister Luke, an outstanding science student was asked to fail an exam so as to not appear to be superior to another, less talented nun in the same course. What the Mother Superior didn't seem to realize was that for Sister Luke to give a false, wrong answer on the final exam, would make her into a liar. As one is watching this movie, they would do well to look for situations such as these and ask himself what God, through the lens of today's Catholic catechism, would expect her to do. Protestants should ask themselves the same things through their doctrines. Knowing that everyone in religious life in this movie was sincerely trying to serve God in their best way possible, one can see the makings of great drama. The big question addressed by 'The Nun's Story' is which way is the right way? Or, maybe, different people need different ways of serving God, so both are right? Perhaps, like Sister Luke, you'll want to pray about it. Watch this classic movie, then decide for yourself! 
Seen again for the first time in a couple of decades, Warner's beautifully restored DVD of The Nun's Story is a real surprise, avoiding the mawkish sentimentality that usually accompanied old Hollywood's approach to Catholicism with a sober, quiet unostentatious majesty and a mostly successful attempt to avoid clichï¿½ (there's no romance with Peter Finch's surgeon as you might expect). Fred Zinnemann, who now seems on the verge of being completely forgotten, constantly does things slightly differently - not just jump cutting from continent to continent, but avoiding convention in subtle ways. When Sister Luke departs for the Congo, not only is her departure handled in the bare minimum of shots but they're also not the ones you usually expect: no head on shots of the ship leaving for the open sea, but instead zooming out from a sideways view before cutting to the ship's wake. The visual economy never feels Spartan, but at the same time it fits the subject matter perfectly. Audrey Hepburn too is something of a revelation. Too often an irritatingly kooky pixie clotheshorse, here she abandons many of her usual affectations that you either find charming or maddening to give the kind of sincere and grounded performance that was too rarely asked of her. It's a quietly powerful and surprisingly honest film that stands up to the test of time. Shame that for some reason Zinnemann gets Dean Jagger to voice one of the bit players as well, which briefly takes you out of the movie before a sudden act of unexpected violence shocks you back in, but there's little else to fault in it. The only extra on the DVD is the original trailer 
Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances. The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art. Certainly, the movie is not "fun," but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster 
Capturing one's spiritual crisis hardly sounds like the ideal cinematic subject, but master director Fred Zinnemann does an unparalleled job of dramatizing the inner turmoil and the quest for serenity and immaculate devotion in the life of a Belgian novice in the 1930's. This is no small feat as so much of the story has to do with evoking what is essentially a journey of introspection in this 1959 classic. Fortunately, Audrey Hepburn is luminous as the novice, Sister Luke, who begins the movie as Gabrielle ("Gaby") van der Mal, the daughter of a notable surgeon, who dreams of going to the Congo as a nurse for the natives. Proving she doesn't need Givenchy couture or an adoring leading man to complete her, Hepburn brings her character to shimmering life in a fully dimensional performance. It also helps that Robert Anderson has written an impressive screenplay based on Kathryn Hulme's expansive novel based on a friend who was indeed a Belgian nurse and a former nun. The story has three discrete parts. The first focuses on Gaby's induction into the Catholic order and the exacting transition she makes from postulant to novice. What strikes me most about this part of the movie is not so much the deeper spirituality at the foundation of the training but the near cult-like behavior demanded of the postulants. It's an impressive rite of passage with particularly effective turns by Mildred Dunnock as the humorless Mother of Postulants and especially Edith Evans as the Reverend Mother, a figure concurrently maternal and fearsome. The newly named Sister Luke is assigned to the mental ward of a Belgian asylum where she experiences an episode of terror with a young Colleen Dewhurst as a combative schizophrenic patient. The film's second section has Sister Luke fulfilling her dream to go to the Congo but only to treat the European patients at a white hospital. Still, she makes an impression on the native population as well as Dr. Fortunati, a bellowing atheist and brilliant surgeon who is soon impressed by Sister Luke's medical skills. The two bond, and there is an unspoken feeling of romance, especially during her bout with tuberculosis. However, her skills demand her to go back to Belgium now on the verge of WWII. The third and last part of the movie has Sister Luke back at the convent and struggling with her vows, especially as the Nazis invade and personal tragedy occurs. Zinnemann smartly avoids wartime action shots and lets the nuns recite news headlines as a means of visualizing the carnage surrounding the order. The film ends with an extremely moving, wordless sequence of Sister Luke deciding her fate. As a Belgian who suffered through WWII, Hepburn has an obvious affinity with Gaby/Sister Luke, and even covered head to toe by her habit, she lets her beautiful face express a full range of emotions. Peter Finch plays Dr. Fortunati with convincing swagger, and a gallery of fine character actresses make strong impressions despite the constrictions of their habits. In the Congo sequence, Peggy Ashcroft is a lively presence as Mother Mathilde, and Dorothy Alison makes the optimism of Sister Aurelie palpable and ultimately poignant. Dean Jagger plays the small role of Gaby's father with his requisite paternal appeal. Franz Planer's cinematography is first-rate, especially the National Geographic-like scenes in the Congo, and Franz Waxman does his usual sterling work on the stentorian music score. The new 2006 DVD only offers the original trailer as an extra, a shame since the film is so accomplished in many ways 
Others have reviewed this film extensively in this forum. Simply put, this was Audrey Hepburn's best performance, and should have brought her a second Oscar win 
Perched high atop the list of the finest American movies of the 1950's, Fred Zinnemann`s "The Nun's Story" is an intensely beautiful and powerful film about a woman who undergoes a crisis of faith and, through her struggle, learns the importance of finding one's true path in life. Based on the novel by Kathryn Hulme, the film tells the story of Gabrielle van der Mal, a Belgian woman who enters the convent in the 1930`s, spends a brief period working as a nurse in the Congo, then leaves the order after years of intense personal struggle with herself and with God. Among American films of its time, "The Nun's Story" stands virtually alone in its ability and willingness to dramatize a conflict taking place in the deepest recesses of a character's mind and soul. Audrey Hepburn - sans makeup and the kind of fashion-plate wardrobe that had already become the hallmark of her movie career - delivers one of her richest performances as the strong-willed and fiercely independent Sister Luke, whose very psyche is torn asunder by the battle between her own innate, personal pride and a sincere desire to live a life of obedience to the Church and its rules. With everything but her countenance hidden beneath a nun's habit, Ms. Hepburn is forced to draw on her resources as an actress, having to convey the titanic internal conflict taking place within her character almost entirely through facial expressions, vocal intonations and body language. And she proves herself more than equal to the challenge. She is brilliantly complemented by Peter Finch, playing the cynical but humane Dr. Fortunati, a dedicated surgeon who is as concerned about Sister Luke's spiritual health as her physical health. The relationship between the two is handled with a great deal of subtlety and tact, never allowing the obvious romantic attraction between the two attractive people to come too much to the fore. Rounding out the excellent cast are Dean Jagger as Gabrielle's loving and concerned father, Peggy Ashcroft and Mildred Dunnock as two older nuns who help guide Sister Luke along the way, and the incomparable Edith Evans, simply astounding as the Reverend Mother who sees unwavering devotion to God and the Church as the one and only goal of a serious nun. Among other things, "The Nun's Story" is that rare film dealing with religion and spirituality that doesn't contain a single hokey or sentimental moment, that knows the difference between religion and religiosity, that is respectful without being unduly reverential, and that acknowledges the complexity of the human heart in matters of devotion and faith. It also is not afraid to take its time to set the scene and tell its story, never feeling the need to rush headlong into the next dramatic moment just to keep the movie going. In a perfect blending of form and content, the film is every bit as thoughtful, subtle and contemplative as its subject matter, its mood greatly enhanced by the rich and evocative Franz Waxman score that underlines the seriousness of the work. In addition to all its other fine virtues, "The Nun's Story" features one of the greatest final scenes and closing shots in motion picture history, a masterpiece of precision and understatement that demonstrates the kind of taste Zinnemann always displayed as a director. The movie is made up of small, beautifully observed moments that, when put together, provide a powerful glimpse into the heart and life of a fascinating, caring individual who wants to do great things in the world but who realizes that the path she has chosen is not the one that will ultimately lead her to her rightful destiny. On every level of filmmaking, this is truly one of the greats 
You do not have to be Catholic to appreciate the towering schievement that "The Nun's Story" is. This is an example of what Hollywood used to do very well in portaying an intimate character study against an epic backdrop. Audrey Hepburn is simply tremendous as Sister Luke, a woman torn between her devotion to God and service to humanity. Peter Finch matches her as the world-weary humanistic doctor. As a Catholic and educated by nuns this film gave me an appreciation for the sacrifices these woman make to better serve Jesus Christ and humanity. It's surprising that a film of this magnitude took so long to make it to DVD 
"The Nun's Story" is a movie I watch everytime it shows on TV (unfortunately too rarely), plus I've had the VHS version for years. I'm not sure exactly what I find so compelling about this movie, but I find it incredibly moving everytime I see it. Audrey Hepburn is just tremendous, as is the entire cast. The story is thought-provoking in a way too few movies made today are. I grew up Catholic (though admittedly a bit lapsed today) and was educated by nuns up through high school. This movie reflects what I saw in the sisters from school - some were mean and petty, others unbelievably generous and spiritual, but all ultimately human. This movie really resonates for me, maybe because of my memories growing up 
You have to give credit to the Dog Brothers for bringing realism to the stick-fighting arts. This video features numerous full-contact stick fights between fighters wearing minimal protection and different skill levels and approaches, all skilfully narrated by Eric ("Top Dog") Knaus. Knaus spins a running commentary throughout each fight, pointing out the important aspects of each fighter's techique, whether it's working or not, and any problems or mistakes. Interspersed with the fights are brief interviews with the fighters themselves, discussing what it was like to fight, get hit, and survive. Knaus is in several of the fights himself and as the senior instructor you can see the difference between his level of skill and technique and the less skilled fighters, but the quality of the participants is overall pretty good, I would say. This video shows that the basics are what count in a real fight, and that the fancier and more elaborate techniques such as double-stick normal and reverse figure-eights are easily counterable if you know what to do. The other thing I noticed is the complete absence of passing maneuvers. Apparently these just don't work that well in a real fight, despite many teachers who still teach complete systems of passing techniques. All in all a very practical, educational, and interesting addition to your stick-fighting video library. By the way, the style of stick fighting in this video is Indonesian Pekiti Tersia, not Escrima, Arnis, or Kali, but it's very similar to those arts, and Knaus mentions they've also incorporated elements of the Filipino arts into their style, such as the Ilustrisimo cross-step. I also have Christopher Ricketts and Reynaldo Galang's four- video set on Kali Ilustrisimo and they're also excellent videos on this originally southern-island Filipino art. I especially liked their coverage not only of the special flow drills and stick techniques, but also of the Lingua de Fuego ("Tongue of Fire") knife-fighting kata and its applications 
this is a great movie and I got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much 
While those who did NOT read book 4 might be puzzled, the film still holds great magic for the rest of us. The telling of the tale, complex and dark, is handled well. The special effects were excellent, the character growth wonderful and true. How this will play out in future editions and movies is part of the magic of this series 
It's Harry Potter...need I say more. The DVD is excellent and the bonus DVD is awesome 
My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of "healthy" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story. 
I really enjoyed the watching the movie for it's scene with the Dragon and I thought the movie was interesting the whole time. I've watched it several times since I purchased it 
Harry enters teenage-hood complete with his first serious crush, a Quidditch World Cup, and budding feelings between Ron and Hermione. With all the angst of puberty our hero has to deal with Lord Voldemort's return and the death of one of the popular pupils. The progressive maturity of Harry and his friends hint at the struggles to come 
Ignore all those Harry Potter nerds who say that it wasn't like the book, I mean who cares if it wasn't exactly the same as the book the film still turned out to be good and is a great follow up in the series. The missing scene involved that house elf from the book but it is not important, its great seeing all the characters grow up onscreen as they grow older the films become more serious but are still fun to watch. This film concentrates more on the Tri-wizard Tournement as Harry tries to prove that hes the most qualified and experienced wizard even though the senior wizards are giving him a hard time, you also get to see harry, Ron and Harmione prepare for the ballroom dance so there is alot of humor in it as well as some dark scenes when Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennes finaly makes an appearence (in person and not as something else) and has a confrontation with Harry Potter. Overall I would say that this film was great but not my favorite I still prefer Prisoner of Azkaban 
For The movie: As a harry potter reader its difficult to review a harry potter movie based on: 1 - You want to like the movie, because you like the whole concept 2 - You find your favorite parts of the book turned into great movie sequences, which you like 3- Then you start to think that so many things were left out of the book, that arent even explained in the movie, like priori incantatum, i mean, if you havent read the book, you wouldnt know why harrys parents showed up in the final duel, but in the other hand general audiences didnt care, at least people i saw the movie with. 4- Then you realize that in order to make the movie work most of these things had to go, and new things added, to get audiences attention. 5 - In the end you realize that you liked the movie, that was a fun experience, the most important plot points were treated and wonder how movie 5 will turn out. The DVD The dvd is great, great image, great sounds, the extras are great, better than any other Harry Potter DVD, its a good thing that they increase from movie to movie, my favorite extras were the making of the three task (specially the maze) and MEET THE CHAMPIONS, a day in the life of the three actors portraying the three champion. The deleted scenes i liked, the one with the band not much, but the rest were fine. Overall a good movie, and a good Dvd 
I think Orwell could almost sit up and cackle "I TOLD you so!" even as we gobble nachos and watch Monday night football (or PBS or Fox - doesn't matter). Between the propaganda we are fed by the Republican mercantilists or the Democratic marxists, there is little truth. Watch this film, then try to find a theater showing Aaron Russo's "America: From Freedom to Fascism". Then be afraid - but not for long. Get up and take action 
This is a powerful and convincing documentary that claims the media is not reporting the news so much as it is reporting what media moguls say is the news. Pappas also draws a parallel between today and what happened in George Orwell's 1950 classic, "1984." Only this time it is conservative forces, not Stalinists, controlling the message. There are several examples to support the producer's assertion. In the presidential race of 2000 Al Gore was a called a liar many times during the campaign for things he did not say, but were attributed to him. On the other hand, Mr. Bush lied several times, but was never challenged on some real whoppers. For example, Bush claimed that as Governor of Texas, the state now had the finest health care program in the country. (He left out that he vetoed the bill twice, and left it on his desk unsigned.) The investigative journalist, Gregory Pallast found a list of ninety some thousand people who were listed as felons in Florida where it is illegal for them to vote. Only most of them were not felons, but were African American (who usually voted democrat.) Over 57,000 people were denied their constitutional right. Compared to white counties, the list was almost nill. Pallast, who is also an economist, claimed this would be a statistical impossibility. But then, Florida's secretary of state was Katherine Harris, who was also working for the Bush campaign. (Conflict of interest here?) Pallast offered the story to CBS who did not run it because, they said, they had checked with the governor's office and Katherine Harris, who claimed it wasn't true. A story of this magnitude got very little press--in the US. There are perhaps five or six conglomerates that now control what Americans will see or hear as news compared to the hundreds of large and small news varieties that readers could choose from even twenty years ago. The message according to Pappas reflects the political views of the moguls, moguls such as Rupert Murdoch, right-wing advocate. This monopoly was allowed to occur when Ronald Reagan repealed several regulations that guaranteed "fair and balanced" (Whoops, sorry!). A price we are paying for more and more each day. Pappas asserts that without a free press. or a press that is not allowed to pursue real news, Americans are losing more freedom on a daily basis and are under an illusion that they live in a democracy. Add to this average American disinterest in how their government operates and how the press manipulates them. As the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebels said, "Repeat a lie often enough, and people will take it as fact." If you wish to delve deeper into these topics, I urge you to read, "Armed Madhouse..." and "The Best Democracy Money can Buy," "Lapdogs" by Boehlert, "Fraud... by Waldman, "Moyers on America" and Helen Thomas'latest book about the White House Press Corps. This story presents facts. It is a good starting point for anyone developing an interest in our press and its politics. Anyone who may claim that this work is bogus, has to be in denial. And there's plenty of that going around these days. This story is so bad, it's double good. Get it? Get it 
I'm familiar with most of the information in this movie but I suspect that a lot of people, the working middle class (which I'm a part of so I know what I'm talking about) are not. They are too busy watching Fox News and listening to talk radio. I hope enough people who are disenchanted with the Bush Administration and their shrinking personal budget would occasionally watch a movie such as this. It's about how the media is biased because it's owned by Corporate America. How deregulation by the Telecommunications Act hurts our nation. They are buying up the small independent stations. Corporate America and the Republicans would love to regulate the internet because there is too much information they prefer we didn't know. They will try to use some pseudo-intellectual reason to censor the internet by euphemist language (like they did with Patriot Act) to brainwash the unquestioning citizens in our country. Please watch this with a family member or friend who is open or ready to re-think their right wing views. 
As per the title, the movie highlights/compares the warnings found in Orwell's dystopian book 1984 with what is presently occurring in the United States and probably elsewhere. Basically the premise is that a few large private corporations are forming a global monopoly to control all forms of media communication: the internet, television, newspapers, radio stations, magazines, advertising....and when this wealthy uber minority finally controls all global communication, they can then completely control people's opinions and ultimately the government by controlling access to information and media exposure. They will control people's opinion by selectively feeding the people only "fair and balanced" information that the people "can trust". The ideas presented in the film are nothing new to educated free thinking people, but these ideas may help others who are blind to this developing/worsening threat. Speakers in the film also remind us that so far the internet temporarily remains the last relatively unconstrained media outlet for the small journalist only because it so new and the uber meister's well paid minions haven't figured out how to completely control it yet. The producer/speakers hope that the "vegged out masses" will stand up and argue/fight for a change to a true pluralistic democracy- and not just for the choice of republican or democrat. Mentioned are good examples of Nazi propaganda ideology, the manipulation methods the media uses for information control, political control, and techniques of "spin" illustrated with recent political events. On a similar note, a good current example of this media bias/blackout (unfortunately this example is not in the film) is the so called "energy crisis" that has been popular off and on in the U.S. news for decades. Many people in different countries have witnessed and reported on permanent magnet/ pulsed electromagnet based electrical generators (the so called "overunity or free energy" machines), but this critical information- the inexpensive, pollution-free solution to the energy crisis- has not (and probably will not) be allowed by the uber meisters to be discussed in national U.S. news media like Fox or CNN news. This documentary makes you question what is the true extent of how we are being psychologically manipulated and herded by the interests of private corporations? It also clearly points out why a mainstream, open public access media system is so critical in a real democracy- otherwise we will all soon live in societies completely controlled by faceless global corporations and corrupt politicians that are only interested in the power and comfort of the very,very few. I gave this documentary 5 stars because its educational mission was well done- entertaining and informative- similar to the documentary "The Corporation". Oingo boingo said it awhile back-"wake up-its 1984".  
starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti-corperate rant.the problem with the media is bias, the problem with this film is the same bias 
I'll make this short and sweet. I used to work in spin. I did advance, which is creating media events for politicians. In other words, for a time I was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information. I'll let others speak to the eerie connections to Orwell's foresight. I'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case. That which is represented in this piece is true. The observations are astute. The prognosis is grim. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers. Buy it. Watch it. Watch it again. Share it with friends. 
No surpri$e for Orwell fans. Too bad THIS film is not repeated daily on CNN. But the truth is not the mainstream's business, celebrity is. They count on the cerebrally challenged! In fact- they bank on it.! So here is an antidote. An aspirin for the dis- mis- information FULL. 
This film is unbelievably good. I DVR'd it on Free Speech TV, and I have watched parts of it again and again. At every turn you will be blown away by the revelations in this film, if you, like me, had never thought much about who controls mainstream media. The first time I watched it I kept having to stop the tape and just cringe, letting the import of the facts sink in. The talking heads are people you may never have encountered, but whom you are unlikely to forget. Write their names down. Check into their books. Even if you don't buy the film look at the list of people in it and get their books. Particularly incisive are the inquiries into the most recent Presidential elections. You were there, I was there, but Lewis shows us the ugly underside that the media can't afford to let us see. This is scary, take-to-the-streets stuff. Finally, Pappas deserves to be more well-known as a documentarian. If you are put off by Michael Moore's whininess and slightly embarassing approach, you may find a new friend in Robert Kane Pappas. 
The high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by George Orwell ( OR Francis Schaeffer, or Theodore Dalrymple or even John Mortimer -for the loyal opposition)-Trite, smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read Paleo Conservative journals like AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a FULL 8 years under Clinton as well) is challenged by BOTH those on the left AND the right.It is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis. TRY reading "HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE?" by SCHAEFFER or DALRYMPLE's "OUR CULTURE ,WHAT's LEFT of IT" for a more intelligent and cogent analysis 
I thought this movie was very good. I love the Middle Ages time era, and the things that made this movie good was the fact that it had some history in it. Plus, I liked the way they showed that there were certain problems with traveling back and forth through time. And how at a certain point you won't be able to get back home:( Then, too the end of the movie with Maverick and Lady Claire buried in the tomb stone HE was actually digging up himself. It makes you wonder who would've been there in his place if he kept digging 
I enjoyed the movie very much. Since I love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as Merrick says when men still had honor, I wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime. Besides I'm a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs, even if it mean't changing history. I liked that they portayed Lady Clair as a tough, stand up to the bad guy, do what needed to be done, spy for her brother to win the battle, kinda lady 
i thought this was a good movie..mainly because gerard butler is in it and he is a very good acto 
The book is better than the movie but I like this genre so I gave it a try. Glad I did 
I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004. I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster. The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting. I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner. There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting. When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story. The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie. I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with. Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time. This really isn't worth your time. I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
Director Richard Donner (LADYHAWKE, SUPERMAN, LETHAL WEAPON I, II, III, IV, etc.) leads an ensemble cast of stars Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, Frances O'Connor, Ethan Embry, Morton Csokas and David Thewlis "back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist!" (Yeah! I wrote those words! Not another critic yet it's a true analysis of this fantastic film!) If you loved Richard Donner's LADYHAWKE then TIMELINE (2003) based on the novel by Michael Crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely! Modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor. ON the way and IN the way are knights of not so good caliber, ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there! My rating of TIMELINE is FIVE STARS! I can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you, the viewer to truly enjoy it, I'm not! When I saw TIMELINE for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful DONNER PRODUCTION and Billy Connolly, a Scot to whom my heart had been lost. The character of "Marek" (Gerard Butler) enslaved me upon my first sight of him! As "Creedy" in REIGN OF FIRE I'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that I'd gone to cheer on in the film. "Creedy's" torched demise gave me cause to end their existence. "Marek" is yet another character such as LADYHAWKES "Navarre." (Rutger Hauer) For ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man's man, "Marek" is your fellow! TIMELINE is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to "back to the future!" This is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again! For ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand's grasp at a moment's notice! :-) 
This is a movie you must see if you like travel adventures movies. All than continues time is supreme! I totally recomend this movie! 
PBS did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together. It covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films. The documentary includes many interview pieces with Kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like. Also, there are comments from noted Japanese film historian Donald Richie. As a Kurosawa fan watching this on PBS when it aired, the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour. It is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century 
I saw this on PBS' Great Performances. This documentary is about film genius Akira Kurosawa. The documentary charts Akira Kurosawa's early life in pre-WWII Japan to the end of his life. Kurosawa brought Japanese cinema to a world wide audience. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Akira Kurosawa fan. Plus the DVD has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the PBS program and Kurosawa filmography 
This movie came out when I was twelve and I have been in love with it ever since. It brought me, a rural farm kid, the magic of Leonard Cohen, Concrete Blond, Was (Not Was),The Beastie Boys, and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film. It also brought me Christian Slater in a role that I would later relate to in a big way as a teen. In short, for reasons all sentimental, I love this film. It may not have cohesiveness in the same way "Heathers" does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days. So watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school. I know I do 
This is a classical anti enstablishment movie with teens bringing down the man. It is a classic Christian Slater movie. Love it 
Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience. However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens. The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior. Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them. As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation. The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise? The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes. Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right. Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
Having seen parts of this film over a span of the last decade or so, without fully seeing all of it, I noticed this DVD on sale at a huge retailer.. (Rhymes with Ball-Mart), for only $4.88, I couldn't resist picking it up to see it all finally. Was it worth it? Yes. I am a straight married guy, and a huge fan of Christan Slater. I have seen damn near every movie with him in it, and Pump was another classic. Did I love everything about this movie? No. It definately reeks of late 80's references and inuendo. I.E. "Bill and Ted" Clones. The story was very well done, however, it contains 2 major flaws. (1) I am a cop, and I know for a fact the Federal Government, would not send the FCC after a lone pirate station who is not screaming for the downfall of government. But is ranting about the local high school administration. (2) I didn't like the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but just say it could have been better. Overall it was a 4 out of 5. Not bad for a film from 1990. 
It's hard to describe what a great movie this was because there's so much that's great about it. Christian Slater's a nerd during the day and runs a pirate radio show at night, he's like Clark Kent and Superman. He enables the teens to be themselves and lead their own lives, and ultimately causes the reversal of educational discrimination at his new school. Pump up the Volume is the kind of movie that will give you goosebumps. You'll want to go back in time and relive high school all over again. 
great movie about radio stations how they should be, christian slater was a great actor in movie. (... 
I actually just saw this movie recently, and I have to say it's definitely my favorite Christian Slater flick. The dialogue in this movie is incredible and it even lets you use your brain, something 2005 movies don't tend to have. If you're not thinking of BUYING this movie definitely at least check it out 
This rocks!!! Well acted, Good Sound Track and the one thing I also love is it has that 80's feel even though it came out in the early 90's. My favorite thing is at the time there was nothing like it!! 
this movie is about Christian Slater (Heathers, True Romance) who plays Hard Harry the pirate radio man of his pirated show. this is a movie that deals with rebellion and teen angst..kids who want to live their lives free of all the things they are imprisoned to do and they tune into Slater's show everynight to listen to him speak it loud and proud. Samantha Mathis' (Broken Arrow, That Thing Called Love) film debut...this is number 1 out of the 3 movies her and Slater star together in. Cheryl Pollack (My Best Friend Is A Vampire) is hotter then ever. Slater's flawless performance and unforgettable moments make this one a masterpiece and a movie not to be forgotten, one of the best movies of 1990. Also starring Mimi Kennedy (Tv's Dharma and Greg), Scott Paulin, Andy Romano, Ellen Greene (Talk Radio) and Billy Morrisey (Severed Ties) co-star. note: Seth Green (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Party Monster) has a short but recognizable role in here and so does Martin Landau's daughter Juliet Landau (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Ed Wood). 
This movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun. It is the furthest thing from a slow-moving documentary. The technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer. The Source is glossy and gorgeous. The director's clout is also impressive. Johnny Depp gives a performance monologue as Jack Kerouac and John Torturro gives an emotional reading from "Howl." Dennis Hopper imitates Burroughs as well later in the film. Their efforts are impressive. Just to let the skeptics out there know, there is no room for doubt in this documentary. The beats are heroes and saviors--and not much else is considered. That some of them were minor talents is brushed over. Massive beat generation fans would give it five stars. A totally sanitized version of William S. Burroughs is presented, and it is implied that Kerouac was only a heterosexual, which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious. The film's attitude towards drug use is rather slanted. One memorable quotation was, "you can overdose on anything including sushi." Well no, not really. It does not matter though, the movie is an amazing sprint and it succeeds in making itself impossible to turn off. 
This is a serious documentary on the beat / hippie movement. It has tons of old footage and interviews with many of the most prominent beat figures like Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Corso, Ferlinghetti etc etc. It has historical footage of events like the Democratic National Convention in '68 and the be-in in San Francisco in '67. This is the perfect movie for someone who loves the beats or someone who has never heard of them. I didn't know much about them when i first watched this documentary on PBS, but after watching it i immediately became interested in their movement. I started reading a lot of the major works like On The Road, Naked Lunch, and Howl and turned into a major fan. This movie is exceptionally well-made and presented. It does have some Hollywood stars like Johnny Depp, but they are only reading the works of Beat authors, and do not have a major role. This is just a great documentary which contains valuable information and interviews with major beat characters who have since passed away. This is a must have for any fan of the beats, hippies, yippies, drugs, american literary movements, the counterculture, or just good documentaries in general. I absolutely love it and have watched it several times 
"The Source" is an excellent documentry on 'The Beat Generation'. It was so good I saw it twice in the theaters. The documentry has a wealth of new material as long as familiar classic footage. My personal favorite writer Jack Kerouac came out of the beat generation and it was fantastic to see him and learn more about him. The documentry always explores other key figures like :Ginsberg, Burroghs, Cassidy among others. Three actors recite famous works by Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroghs. Johnny Depp and Dennis Hopper do fair jobs at working with material by Kerouac and Burroghs but Chuck Workman slaughters Ginsberg's poem "Howl". The only fault about this documentry was the previous and that it had to end. Check "The Source" out 
This is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject. The clips of Ginsberg &amp; Burroughs are especially effective. The celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself &amp; not just empty theatrics. The Beats are still a source to return to for inspiration &amp; insight. The world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now. Of course there's more, but this video gives you enough to get you started &amp; gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late 
When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement. This film, including interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs. With a large assembly of other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement. It is interesting to see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media treated the sense of a "cool" movement; they painted a false portrait. This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested. However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one. Also, I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces of work when the actual writers could have performed it. Honestly, I skipped these parts. I wanted to see Ginsburg doing "Howl." Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on the fly. I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting). However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few viewings. It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have before and enjoyed alot of the material 
"The Incredibles", together with "Finding Nemo", "Shrek 1 2", "Madagascar" and the "Spy Kids" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking. Particularly The Incredibles is a movie no kid (or adult as well) will ever get tired of watching. As for the plot... it is just plainly great. Things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle. But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job. My kids just love this movie (and so do I! 
To violent for anyone! This movie is horrible. The cast is good, but the plot stinks! Its just this family who have super powers. Then this kid wanted to be Mr. Incredibles side kick. (in a way)Mr. Incredible says no so then he hates him. Then the kid turns evil and kills people, and wants every body to like him. Thats origanal. There are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes, and there is way to much violence. Killing, guns, punching, bombs, and they say stupid words sometimes. I do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence. So I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Especially the 2 disc special edition! 
The Incredibles is a fully-fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn't just another summer kiddie flick. The Incredibles family members aren't cookie-cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon. :-) The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years. The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life. Overall a great effort from Pixar and they'll have to work hard to top this one 
While it may not be a completely original idea, "The Incredibles" is an action-packed, thoroughly amusing piece of computer animation, containing the vocal talents of Craig T.Nelson as Robert Parr/Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as his wife Helen/Elastagirl, Samuel L. Jackson as the cool (in every sense of the word) Lucius Best/Frozone, and director Brad Bird as the diminutive superhero costume designer Edna (E) Mode as the principal characters. We are introduced to the superheroes as young adults expressing their views, and in one instance, the pitfalls of being a superhero in interviews. Then we see them in action, observing Mr. Incredible's might, Elastagirl's grace and flexibility, and Frozone's lithe ability freeze things, all en route to the wedding of the first two characters. An overzealous fan named Buddy Pine hinders Mr. Incredible's ability to do his job in the process of an unwarranted audition as the superhero's sidekick. Having firmly discouraged the young boy from joining him in his crime-fighting duties in the past, he uses a more combative approach the last time around--an act that will come back to haunt him. An amusing touch of realism follows as Mr. Incredible is sued by a man injured when the superhero saves him from a suicide attempt, and then by the survivors of an el train incident. A wave of lawsuits against superheroes by an ungrateful public forces all superheroes underground. 15 years later, we find Mr. Incredible as average, everyday Bob Parr, working for an insurance company, getting his expressed wish to lead the normal life that he had sometimes wanted to lead. But his generous nature towards his clients clashes with company policy, much to the dismay of his boss (voiced by an exasperated Wallace Shawn). He and his family suffer because they are denied the right to be the extraordinary people they truly are. Meanwhile, Helen Parr has to deal with her son, Dashiell's (Spencer Fox's) disruptive behavior in school, which is largely the result of his mother's refusal to let her superfast son compete in sports. Daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell) pines for a popular boy at school, but has a typical adolescent's self-consciousness about being different. The only one without problems is that Parr's adorable infant son, Jack-Jack. Family tensions reach their height during a dinner session at which the family display the powers they hide from the world. Parr keeps the loss of his job a secret from Helen, and goes on under- cover work with Lucius--the only superhero friend he sees anymore--which, over time, has become riskier and riskier. Surveillance by the green-eyed, exotic Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), who has all the mystique of a Bond Girl, results in Bob's resumption of the hero work he loves. We see how this makes him a happier man, a more flirtatious husband, as well as a more attentive and affectionate father. In the meantime, he visits the stylish and eccentric Edna for the refurbishing of his supersuit. As Parr travels to the location of his new assignment, Helen learns the truth about his whereabouts, and after being challenged by a learning robot that has been created for destructive purposes, Mr. Incredible discovers who is behind his being lured to that area, and made to recall a certain incident from the past. It has been observed that many tragedies in life occur because someone wanted to feel important. The murderous and vengeful Syndrome(voiced by Jason Lee) is just such a person. Unable to fulfill his dreams of being a superhero in his youth, and still too petty to consider the legal ramifications of a superhero taking a minor on a crimefighting mission even as an adult, he proves to be the Incredibles' great nemesis, and he still fails to make an impressive showing as a superhero even as an adult. The lesson offered by this story is that while hard work and innovativeness, such as Syndrome displays, are to be admired, natural and exceptional abilities are specially catagorized for a reason. The natural abilities of the superheroes made them privy to a certain insider's knowledge about suprhero costumes that Syndrome, the innovative outsider, isn't, which will be his undoing. Syndrome might have been a happier person if he had accepted that he wasn't meant to do what his one-time idol did, and found a better use for his own abilities. Highly reminiscent of the story line for "Amadeus", where a rival in a certain field tries to destroy one with a phenomenal natual ability who, in some way, has disappointed him, and pass himself off as having that natual ability,the story is, as many have noted, an animated version of James Bond, and as is often the case with modern animation, the personalities of the actors come through, and audiences can easily forget it is a computerized cartoon because the characters are so life-like. It's a fun story in which to lose onself, and a terrific piece of animation for all ages. Once again, a masterful effort from the crew of Pixar 
Great movie! Delivery of the order came in good time. This 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with some interesting extras. I found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing. Personnally I would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie. Although it is interesting to watch, especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business, I find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself. Just my personal preference. No doubt others will have different opinions 
This film is a masterpiece - certainly the best cartoon I have ever seen, and one of the very best films in any genre - period. The film stars a family of superheroes - the Parr's - who are forced into hiding because of a series of ridiculous lawsuits (Bob Parr: "I saved your life!", suicide guy: "No, you ruined my death!"). The crazy fan "I know all your moves", who irritates Bob to the point of blunt rejection. The ejector seat - a spoof of the Bond Goldfinger movie. The evil madman ("Syndrome" - a set of conditions pointing to a type of disease!) owns an island called "no-man-is-an", and many other jokes. It is also fun to contrast the hilarious attempts of the family to blend in (daughter Violet: "normal - the only one in this family who's normal is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained!") with the dangers they later face. Bob longs for the days to be a hero again, and to see him contain himself is just hilarious, and yet sympathetic at the same time. Its interesting to see them develop in confidence, and learn to use their powers in new ways. Finally, I enjoyed seeing them learn to work together as a family - transitioning from the mundane (borderline dysfunctional) to a formidable team. The "Jack Jack Attack" short movie on disk 2 fits in with the main film, and is also hilarious. The early Bond-style band music also suits the film perfectly - and even outdoes it. It could appeal to some kids who have the attention span to follow a story, but I think it has more appeal for adults who can admire creativity and craftsmanship. Worth multiple viewings. Worth every penny 
With all the weird cartoons on now it was great to watch on with my boys that we agreed on 
From some of the reviews I looked at below you'd think that children didn't have a right to watch the things they enjoy. There are many films I viewed as a young boy that I would not want to watch today, however, they were good for there time. And children need to have their films too! So lighten up adults! This animation was made for, marketed and directed for children. My two young daughters loved this film. And that is all that matters to me. However, I liked it too. My children laughed through many parts of the film, and I right along with them. So you don't have to be a child to enjoy the film. As for the reviewer below, "Toy Story" is great and a wonderful and delightful film. But so is this. If you have children [I have two young daughters] you might consider this film. It is immensely enjoyable with action, suspense, and comedy rolled into one. Just what the children need: A little bit of relaxing fun. The story centers around a family of super-heroes with both the Mom and Dad retired from the spy business to raise a family. But their young children also have super powers. I highly recommend the film [for children] and also for the other children [adults like me]. This is a delightful little treat of a film and does not need apologies or comparisons to other films. Enjoy it for the sake of entertainment. Recommended! 
THE INCREDIBLES is a first-class animated film about a superhero and his family who are forced to seek the anonymity of a government witness protection program to escape a rash of lawsuits orchestrated by their enemies. Mr. Incredible has to endure the boredom of a job as an insurance claims specialist while his wife and children cooperate by also concealing their extraordinary powers in front of others. This is hardest on the children as they play with youngsters at school and on the athletic field. Eventually, Mr. Incredible is lured out of retirement on a ruse by a former foe. By now Mr. Incredible is older and fatter but he still proves equal to the challenge. The rest of the movie is filled with excitement and comical moments as Mr. Incredible finds himself in a tight spot from which only his family can rescue him. The cast is headed by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Ms. Hunter supplies the voice for Elastigirl who is also the wife of Mr. Incredible. THE INCREDIBLES was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Oscars were won for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. In addition, THE INCREDIBLES won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film 
Many Vietnam War movies to date have depicted the American soldier in Vietnam as either a sadistic murderer, at worse, or, at best, an ignorant robotic slave of the industrial-military complex. This film about the early war Battle of Ia Drang depicts the American soldier as simply an ordinary person who has family and who is just trying to survive while surrounded by a North Vietnamese infantry force that is four times larger. Unlike previous films, you will NOT see GIs shooting civilians for sport, raping Vietnamese girls, cussing like sailors, fooling around with prostitutes or just getting drunk. What you WILL see are well-trained Americans fighting insurmountable odds while looking out for their brothers in arms. Compared to more pessimistic movies like "Platoon" and "Full Metal Jacket", "We Were Soldiers" may come across as right-wing patriotic propaganda. However, this movie's ultimate aim is to show what actually occurred at the combat field from a soldier's viewpoint rather than to preach to the public a pacifist political message about the Vietnam War or war in general. One of my few complaints are 1) that the level of North Vietnamese casualties appeared exaggerated while that of the Americans appeared minimized, despite the 4 to 1 casuality ratio that actually occurred during that November 1965 battle, and 2) the climatic, but fictional, bayonet charge at the end that reminded me too much of a real bad patriotic war film also starring Mel Gibson 
I went here to read the reviews of a movie I haven't seen...but I HAVE read the book. In it family members clearly say that they recieved the death notices via telegrams delivered by Taxi Cab drivers (this was before the military started sending Chaplins and live people to deliver the news) and also that news of fatalities were delivered to family members on November 14th (Tom Metzger's wife knows the moment she got the news, of course...)the day the battle started. So...those were true things I guess in the movie. PS- I gave the movie the five starts because I had to give a rating to post this on the site 
This is an excellent movie if you like war flicks. It made me angry being from the Vietnam generation also. It shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men. The acting from all the cast was top class. I highly recommend this movie. It may be slow at first, but the action later is amazing 
I can't possibly put into words how great of a war movie this is, but it touched me deep inside. For me, there is little greater honor than to serve one's country, especially in a time of unpopular war. I felt that his film portrayed that desire of the world's warriors to answer the call of duty and be honorable men, regardless of the side you are fighting on. And that is perhaps one of my favorite things about this movie. Albeit a small part, time was given to the "other" side and we were allowed a glimpse of the enemy warriors. And in the end, Lt. Col. Moore paid homage, in a sense, to the enemy he fought. And, of course, actual footage of Moore is shown on the extras (bonuses are a MUST see!) praising his men -- nearly weeping as he does so. In a time when the only reason people join the service is for college money, and servicemen scramble to get out of the service when war comes, this movie reminds us that we should be that much more grateful for the few that serve with dignity and do it because they are Americans that love their country enough to answer the call when it comes. Without these honorable warriors, there would be no America 
Some might suggest there are now three things not to discuss in polite conversation : 1) Politics 2) Religion 3) Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, the battle that would become known as Hamburger Hill resulted in over ninety per cent of one American platoon dead. Yet a body count would still have been necessary to see which side suffered the greater losses. Directing mass charges via waves of infantry in modern warfare was initially chronicled during the Korean conflict only later officially recognized as a 'War'. And importantly, Hamburger Hill was also a battle before it was made into a movie also about a war named but never declared. As an overview, to modern war, film-making or Army life, "We Were Soldiers" merits full consideration. Mel Gibson turns in a flawless performance walking point on this sortie that became the first major battle of the Viet Nam conflict, later unofficially entitled a "War." One loses count of the important issues exposed in this courageous work. Many would ask, "So who cares?" And that would garner the first score for Gibson. Author Hal Moore, whose "We Were Soldiers Once, And Young" is the basis for this film, certainly deserves first bow for initiating this work, though he might return a horse laugh at the use of 'bow.' Employment of the term 'Broken Arrow,' classicly displays military communication at it's best. WWII vets lived the situation minus the handy appelation. Thus came, 'Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.' That uttered by a man of God in the heat of battle. TL Farley, author, When Now Becomes Too Late 
The main thing that sticks with me after watching this excellent depiction of the early days of the Vietnam War is towards the end of the movie (after the battle) when the press helicopter lands and all the reporters gather around Gibson and the other soldiers and start asking inane questions. It just seemed so jarring and surreal. I mean what the hell do you even say after an experience like that. I kept thinking, in regards to the reporters, that they so couldn't even understand ... and I was only watching the battle (in the comfort of my living room), not fighting in it!! That's realistic moviemaking when I as a viewer felt like I was part of the experience. 
"Hate war, love America's warriors" - that's what author Lt Gen. Hal Moore told Dan Rather, when asked what was the one thing he hoped America would learn from his film, "We Were Soldiers". This book should be required reading for every American high school student and immigrant seeking US citizenship. It is the untold story of America's heros. A generation of heroes who were disowned by their own country in the Vietnam era. Buy several DVD's to pass along as gifts to the next generation. Maybe they will watch it, and understand why they should honor America's warriors 
MY MOVIE REVIEW RUBRIC (03/19/06 VERSION): I. CONTENT (OUT OF 3 POSSIBLE STARS PLUS BONUS): 1.75 A. PHILOSOPHICAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPTH - LEVEL OF THOUGHTFULNESS OF THE MOVIE; PHILOSOPHICAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION, CLARITY, IMPORTANCE AND IMPLICATION (OUT OF 2 POSSIBLE STARS): 1 COMMENTS: The movie attempts to make deeper statements but it fails to care them fully through due to its ingrained, almost reflexive patriotism. Attempt to compare Vietcoms with barbaric native American tribes in one of the earlier scene is disingenuous. It doesn't expalin well how the commander who prayed to God to help him send enemies to hell, sudenely warms up to them so quickly that he is sending a diarie from one of killed enemies to his family. B. ORIGINALITY - LEVEL THE MOVIE IS NON-FORMULAIC, NON-CLICH WITH ORIGINAL ENDING SCREENPLAY (OUT OF 1 POSSIBLE STAR): 0.5 COMMENTS: In many ways it is traditionalist in its structure, however it brings original elements when it juxtaposes scenes of battlefront and home; American and Vietnam troops at war and rest. * BONUS FOR DARING TO DEAL WITH CONTROVERSIAL/UNPOPULAR/TOUCHY TOPICS (UP TO 0.5 ADDITIONAL STARS): 0.25 COMMENTS: Not as touchy as it used to be, but Vietnam war still hurts II. PRODUCTION (OUT OF 2 POSSIBLE STARS PLUS BONUS): 1.75 C. ACTORS' PERFORMANCE - LEVEL TO WHICH ACTORS GET INSIDE THEIR CHARACTER AND CREATE EFFECTIVE PLAY (OUT OF 1 POSSIBLE STARS): 0.75 COMMENTS: In general well acted though occasionally with some artificial bravado D. TECHNICAL QUALITY - LEVEL OF EFFECTIVENESS OF AUDIO/VISUALS; APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF THE MOVIE ETC... (OUT OF 1 POSSIBLE STARS): 1.0 COMMENTS: Effective if gory imagery. Shows what war really is. *BONUS FOR DARING TO CREATE A MOVIE ON A LOW BUDGET (0.5 ADDITIONAL STARS FOR MOVIES UNDER HALF MILLION DOLLARS, 0.25 ADDITIONAL STARS FOR MOVIES UNDER ONE MILLION DOLLARS) TOTAL STAR RATING: 3.5 (approximated to 4 stars for Amazon.com) MY MMPA RATING (NOT BIASED IN FAVOR OF VIOLENCE AND AGAINST SEXUALITY) - G: NO VIOLENCE, NO SEXUALITY; PG: OK SLIGHT VIOLENCE, OK SLIGHT SEXUALITY; PG-13: OK MODERATE VIOLENCE, OK MODERATE SEXUALITY; R: OK EXPLICIT VIOLENCE, OK EXPLICIT SEXUALITY; NC-17 OK EXTREME VIOLENCE; OK EXTREME SEXUALITY - : NC-17, as Gibson's "Passion of Christ" should have been, for extreme depiction of violence 
Based on a true story; Location; Vietnam in The valley of the death. Lt. Colonel Moore leading 400 American troopers is surrounded by 4000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Amazing combat scenes, costumes and weapons with perfect graphic authenticity, making this movie stands apart from all the Vietnam movies ever filmed before. The casting, the dialogue and colors are amazing as well; not to forget the perfect acting of Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott. I have seen all the war movies about Vietnam. In my opinion, `We were soldiers' is one of the best that came so far. From all the aspect described above including the historical side, this movie is a must own to all collectors of this genre. 
I just love this movie, but it may not be for all, since it is a very specific type of humor. Don't expect "Best in Show" or "Waiting for Gufman," because this is not a mockumentary, but rather a really funny movie about the ups and downs in Hollywood. And may I add, very on point. I just love it more and more...and wish Guest would direct another one this funny. In love with both Emily Longstreth and Teri hatcher. I can't pcik which one, so I'll choose both 
Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) has just graduated from film school. And on top of that, he has won a prestigious film award for best film. Couldn't be better right? Well, not exactly. This new found fame, or glitz, that Nick has discovered is hollow. And so is he for that matter. When agents come knocking and offering him the world, so to speak, he actually believes the hype. But this is Hollywood: a place where dreams can be shattered, and careers ruined as fast as they are created. Ah, how sudden they fall. Moreover, Nick's new-found friends in the movie industry treat him as a pariah. Ah, how quickly they forget. Martin Short plays a great role as Nick's agent, whom Nick believes will be his savior now that his 15 minutes of fame have died away. Also, one of the prime movers of the film industry is aptly played by the late J.T.Walsh [one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood]. As Nick tries to woo back his ex-girlfriend, and the friends whom he has ignored since arriving in Hollywood, he begins to find himself, and learns that it is never too late to learn from your mistakes. Highly Recommended! 
The story of a young award winner of a filmmaker's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get "his" first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by Christopher(Spinal Tap)Guest. It's a cynical and hysterical look at how Hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis.  Unlike many of favorable reviewers I'm not a fan of Christopher Guest's later works and that's not just because I'm envious of him being married to Jamie Leigh Curtis(lucky dog). I don't find Guffman or Best of Show more than mildly amusing at best. Save for Bob Balaban in Guffman(When Sparky comes back, I almost bust a gut). Sometimes artists do their best work up front. I like Woody Allen's first three pictures the best(What's Up Tiger Lily, Take the Money and Run, Bananas). I think this is the case here. Guest hit gold. Great script, terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast. A near genius(I'm gonna steal one of the other reviewer's word here because it's so perfect, kudos and thanks) "turn" by JT Walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history(alas, another "great" dying so soon before his time like Warren Oates and Robert Shaw). Fabulous work by Martin Short, Teri Hatcher, J,T, Walsh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Fran Drescher, Dan Schneider, Jason Gould, Wakter Olkewicz and seriously I could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines. There are tons of people in this sublime comedy. Its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the Eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene(Bacon/McKean)that comes off as way too cloying. Other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of Hollywood. Someone said comparing this to The Player was like comparing Bagger Vance to Caddyshack. I'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be sub-par. Caddyshack is a classic and so The Big Picture. I am a big, big fan of Altman and The Big Picture is even par with The Player. If either were more biting I would give the nod to The Big Picture. Though, Richard E Grant's performance is almost as good as Walsh's. Nick's(Kevin Bacon)flights of fancy are hysterical. This is an inspired and unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy. 
I don't know why this film didn't win any academy awards for that year. I love movies and this was one of the best I've seen next to "American Beauty" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". I went to art school in California back in the 80's and this film hit the nail on the head. It's so realistic about the movie industry and it's superficial personalities and players. This is how a movie should be made! Definately 5 stars! 
After performing in the pit for a production of this in my hometown, I wanted to see the original Broadway cast doing this musical. The set is fantastic! What a joy to watch! For the sharp humor side of this show, I'd strongly suggest this DVD recording, but for a more musical expeirience I would buy the soundtrack of the original BW cast. The DVD has a few lagging tempos, which is very annoying after listerning to the snappy soundtrack. Also there are 2 notes that don't quite make it up there on the DVD. Overall, I would highly recomend this DVD recording; I just love Little Red Riding Hood's humor. The CD is worth a listen too. "And home before dark!" 
The Quality of the DVD was excellent. Even th DVD Case was in excellent condition 
this was a terrific way to see the Broadway play, the great cast, long after it happened... 
I love this video! if you love musicals and have a good sence of humor u will love dis movie. I really recommend it 
This cast is awesome. The music is upbeat and beautiful. The Prince's lament is my favorite, and Bernadette Peters is still the best thing to happen to broadway. I saw this cast live in NYC and hits DVD is a reminder of how much fun and energy was in the cast. A great purchase 
Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites. Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited. Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups. This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging. By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath. I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
I just recently purchased the DVD after owning the VHS tape for years to use a research for a paper I wrote about the musicals' commentary on the nature of childhood and children's literature. Although it's not a super high-tech DVD, it's in the performance itself, that the true magic resides in. I've always loved this show and now that I have it on DVD, I can enjoy it for even longer 
FIRST OFF: "The Man in the Moon", is a great film! With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot. IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below] Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old. The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?! THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below] Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens. Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man. Robert Mulligan - Director Sam Waterston - Matthew Trant Tess Harper - Abigail Trant Gail Strickland - Marie Foster Reese Witherspoon - Dani Trant Jason London - Court Foster Emily Warfield - Maureen Trant Bentley Mitchum - Billy Saunders ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER SPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MORE BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT This is quite a little story with a big punch. The supporting roles are impeccably played with Sam Waterston playing Matthew Trant, the father, and Tess Harper playing Abigail Trant, as the mother. They have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in Louisiana. 
I loved the setting of this movie; it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds I enjoy hearing. The pace was relaxed but not dull at all. The plot was sweet, the acting well done. Reese Witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie, her first major role. 
I LOVED this movie. Breathtaking scenery, a simple yet enthralling story, and wonderful acting all around. No drugs, no guns, no over-the-top violence. A nice movie to watch on a rainy day.... 
I love this little story of the relationship between two sisters. The performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting. It still gets me : 
I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time. A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message 
I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it. Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father. I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon). A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film. Rings true to life. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame 
This is a masterpiece of cinema. After watching Robert Mulligan's more famous (to me) movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of '42, I found this jewel. I did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is. Directors like Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch or Vidor and Capra are long gone, and so is cinema as art, but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it, although it may only last a blink of an eye. I am off to check out "Come September" now. Who is this Robert Mulligan, anyway? Lovable little gem 
This has to be one of my all time favorites, along with "An Affair to Remember" and "The Notebook." Richard Gere is fantastic in this role and as you listen to the commentary on the making of the movie you realize how seriously he took the role. He practiced many hours in order for things to look professional and that translates into superb dancing technique. Stanley Tucci is a hoot in this movie and he as well did a great job dancing. Jennifer Lopez was so interesting to watch and as her character evolved she too transformed in front of our eyes. Susan Sarandon did an excellent job playing the wife of Richard Gere. All in all this was entertaining from beginning to end. The music was inspiring and the ballroom scenes with the quick step and the waltz were my favorites. If you enjoyed watching "Dancing With the Stars", you'll love this movie! 
Dancing is a passion that you either like or don't like. How many times have you heard people around you say that they love dancing or that they don't like it at all? Next to those two kind of people you have the people that don't know what to think of it yet cause they haven't danced that much in their lives. To those people, who want to see what dancing is about or if you want to be shown what dancing can do to a human being: watch this film. Shall We Dance tells the story of John Clark, a man who takes care of people's wills for a living. He has a nice family and is happy with them, but still, something inside him doesn't feel happy. He misses something. He finally decides to take a look in a dancing school, where he starts following lessons in secret and gets his life changed. Shall We Dance is a great feelgood film that gives a nice warm feeling. First of all, the film has fantastic actors that give fine acting performances. Richard Gere portrais his character in the exact right way. He lets the character show how he feels in situations very clearly and does that realistically with a whole lot of fun. He is charming and does a fine job as the leading role. Next to Gere, there is Jennifer Lopez. If somebody is criticised on her acting skills a lot, it is Lopez. But don't you worry, Lopez does a fantastic job and is part of the feelgood factor. She acts warm, nice and shows the character's emotions in a succesfull way. Well done. The rest of the cast is one big fun group. Susan Sarandon is perfectly choisen as John's wife and does the part with good acting. The film has hilarious supporting roles from Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Miller and Anita Gillette who all bring the film to a level of great comedy and romantic fun. Technically the film looks professional and perfectly fine. The dancing has been well shot and captured on camera. The editing and the lifting music together sure makes the film swing nicely. The lighting is great, the sets are fun and colorfull to see and the music is on the right track. All these elements together give the film a nice atmosphere that gives you, as the audience, a nice feeling inside. Thats what makes this film powerful in a way: the warm Atmosphere. The comedy is hilarious at some points and the film has some nice jokes. The story may be a bit obvious and predictable, it still is a lot of fun for a night of movie entertainment. Romantic, funny, swinging, even a little drama here and there gives it a nice human touch. A succesful film that lightens up one's spirit and leaves you with a nice big smile on your face. If you love dancing this film is an absolute must see for you. If you love romantic comedies, I would also recommend you this film. If you don't like dancing at all but you love the feeling you get from the movies and the vibe it gives you: just take a look, give it a try and who knows? Maybe you will be linening up in a dancing school only a few days later... "Shall we Dance?" "I'd love to!" Enjoy and most importantly: have fun watching this film! 
Others have gone into great detail about this movie, so I won't. I just want to say that it is the perfect "date movie" for my husband and I, a 40-something, happily married couple. It spoke to both our hearts - my husband has discovered his passionate activity, and I'm working on figuring out mine 
I was not into this movie at all. My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through. A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class. Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out. The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me. Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea. Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
This is the way more movies should be made! It shows excellent talent, has a lot of humor and is super intertaining. And under it all are some great lessons in curtesy, honesty and ethics! I feel good after viewing it 
To be honest, I loved the Japanese original of this movie so much that my first watching of the American version was a little tainted. But I just watched the Richard Gere version again, this time on DVD, and found that I really like it more than I realized. Gere is so winsome (I'll pay to watch him dance any day, he is aging gorgeously!), and Lopez so elegant, and all the other characters so interesting, and the music so sexy, why quibble over which movie is better? This story is entertaining and touching in its own right, even if not as nuanced and heartfelt as the Japaese version. I have watched ballroom dancing competitions for years, and this film conveys the romance and excitement that draws people to those competitions. The story is charming, adult and PG with a satisfying ending -- how rare is that combination these days? The DVD offers good insights into the ballroom training and hard work behind the movie, as well as a wonderful "Sway" music video. Which reminds me -- the soundtrack is excellent, and I bought that, too. 
"Shall We Dance" is, in my opinion, one of the best romantic comedies in years. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a movie with some good entertainment value. You will particularly enjoy this film if you like to watch Ballroom Dancing competitions on PBS or the program "Dancing With The Stars". I also recommend that you watch the original Japanese version of "Shall We Dance", which this movie is based on. Both films share similiarities, but it is interesting to watch both versions of "Shall We Dance" and make your own comparisons. My favorite of the two is the American version of "Shall We Dance", with Richard Gere. He is a multi-talented actor with a touch of Fred Astaire. And he can really dance! 
First, let me start off by saying I think the casting choices for this movie were perfect. I had doubts that the movie would be any good, because I'm not exactly a fan of Jennifer Lopez's acting, but she did a brilliant job playing her part. The movie had great sensual dance seens, and a substantial, interesting storyline to go with it. I'm addicted to dance movies, and anyone who says a dance movie with older people in it can't be good is definitely wrong. Richard Gere was amazing. This movie rocked 
PBS did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together. It covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films. The documentary includes many interview pieces with Kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like. Also, there are comments from noted Japanese film historian Donald Richie. As a Kurosawa fan watching this on PBS when it aired, the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour. It is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century 
I saw this on PBS' Great Performances. This documentary is about film genius Akira Kurosawa. The documentary charts Akira Kurosawa's early life in pre-WWII Japan to the end of his life. Kurosawa brought Japanese cinema to a world wide audience. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Akira Kurosawa fan. Plus the DVD has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the PBS program and Kurosawa filmography 
A Movie that will make you wonder if it could be true. It made you wonder what would happen next or if they would be able to stop it in time and did not come with the normal hollywood happy ending that we all wait for. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie 
I don't know why, but I love this movie. It's very very entertaining, which is the reason I watch movies. Lots of suspense, love the special effects when the bomb goes off, and I'm a die hard Morgan Freeman fan anyway. 
Jack Ryan, the hero of several of Tom Clancy's novels, is back at it in this movie about terrorism and global nuclear war. In 1973, during the Arab-Israeli war, a lone Israeli pilot took off and flew toward the Arab lines. His cargo: one nuclear bomb. However, the plane is shot down, but somehow, the bomb survived. It is soon buried in the sand and left unnoticed for twenty-nine years. Meanwhile, trouble has been occuring in other parts of the world as well. The President of Russia mysteriously dies, and a new President, Nemerov, (Ciaran Hinds) takes power. This move alerts the American CIA, especially director William Cabot (Morgan Freeman). Nemerov is known to be a wild card, and many are unsure of his motives. However, Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) isn't convinced about Nemerov. Ryan wrote a paper about Nemerov, and he seems to think that he is more conservative in his views. Directed by President Robert Fowler (James Cromwell), Cabot and Ryan are sent to Russia to check on the status of their nuclear disarmament. Once there, they are given a tour of a Russian nuclear assembly plant. Many renowned Russian scientists work there. However, three have mysteriously disappeared. Back in the Middle East, two men have managed to dig up the remains of the missing nuclear bomb. They sell them to a man named Olson (Colm Feore), who pays a mere [...] for the bomb. Immediately, the wheels are set in motion. The three missing Russian scientists and Olson have devised a plan to construct their own nuclear bomb, smuggle it back into the United States, and detonate it at the Super Bowl. The detonation would lead the United States to believe that, due to the instability of the Russian government under Nemerov, the Russians would be blamed for the detonation. Both the United states and Russia would destroy each other while the scientists and Olson sat by and watched. However, Ryan manages to put all of the pieces together and is on his way to Baltimore when the bomb is detonated. A huge mushroom cloud covers the city, and many people are killed. As expected, President Fowler immediately suspects that the Russians are to blame and immediately orders a counter-strike. Thus begins a tense game of international chess; who will blink first? Can Ryan arrive in time to stop World War III, or will he be too late? I found this to be a very exciting and entertaining movie. The story is thrilling and very well-conceived. The special effects are very good as well. The attack on the American aircraft carrier was one of my favorite sequences of the film. Morgan Freeman, Ben Affleck, and James Cromwell give fine performances. Although I appreciated Affleck's effort, I still think Alec Baldwin ("The Hunt for Red October") and Harrison Ford ("Patriot Games") did a better job as Jack Ryan. I recommend this very good movie. Although I haven't read the book yet, I plan to soon to see how well the movie compares to it. If you're a fan of techno-thrillers, then don't miss this one 
Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat". On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough. Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor 
The film begins with gripping scenes and haunting music ... Fighter jets landing, powerful spiritual music that is sad and almost like a funeral - setting the tone for what is to come. Ben Affleck plays the CIA agent Jack Ryan to perfection. There is great casting for all the major roles and key characters in the book. Although in the book, the city of Denver is the location used by terrorists for the attack, the choice of Baltimore, Maryland makes sense, since there is a port which clearly can be the point of entry for contraband. The fact is the film remains true to the intentions and spirit of Tom Clancy's book. There is political maneuvering, espionage, edge-of-your seat gripping moments after the attack and a very well executed plot. Suspense builds and the story unfolds ... The topic is fascinating and timely. It is almost like the "007" films of old ... You more or less know what to expect, but the ride is so engaging, you are caught up in the drama and events. A nuclear bomb is discovered in the desert by a bedouin, left buried from a downed airplane during the '73 Israeli War. He suspects it has some value and can make money by selling it. An agent purchases it for a mere pittance, vastly less than its true worth ... so realistic. After the unexpected death of the Russian President, his replacement is investigated by the CIA. The US President, his advisors and the CIA are busy extracting information about this relative "dark horse" to discover his stand on the major issues. In the past, Jack Ryan had written a paper on him, extrapolating his views on world events ... He accompanies a delegation from the US to visit Russia and ensure nuclear disarmament is going according to plans. Each side assesses the opposition with wary reminders of the past ever in the forefront of their minds ... How difficult it was to learn about Soviet arms during the cold war, US agents had died trying to access .information ... now a delegation was freely being shown the labs, nuclear reactor and storage facilties. Times had indeed changed ... The US President attends a filled to capacity football stadium in Baltimore, MD when suddenly, unexpectedly and rapidly Secret Agents usher him out ... A huge explosion occurs, with the mushroom cloud indicating a nuclear bomb went off. During the disaster, Jack Ryan seeks his superior, only to find him taking his last breath. He pays his last respects and uses his cell phone and ID bage to enter the White House. Jack had discovered irrefutable evidence that proves it was *not* a Russian attack. The nuclear substance originated in the United States. The fingerprints of the explosion and subsequent fall out are positive proof. However, suspense builds as the US President and Russian President are on stand-by preparing for war ... trying to read each others motives for action. The unraveling of the peace accords takes minutes although it took years and years to create peace and disarmament. The difficult decisions faced by the US President are depicted superbly ... The raw emotions arising during such a national disaster are naturally conveyed. The only failure in the film is the choice of selecting a disgruntled fascist group as the culprits for the attack. Keeping it closer to the story line in the book would have paid off huge dividends in the short and long run. In the years following 2001 and the Sept. 11th attack, using ancient history such as Nazi-like fascists as the enemy just does not play well with an audience. It leaves a huge credibility gap ...this is why it reminds me of the "007" films. Despite this one major flaw, for which I deducted one star, the film was a hit with this viewer. I highly recommend it. Erika Borsos [pepper flower 
The Sum of All Fears is about soldiers in war. The book talks about the fear men have when they are in war. We never think about the fear men have when they're in a war. In The Sum of All fears soldiers were surrounded by friends and men dying around them. They worry about staying alive each second. They crawl from one ditch to another. Soldiers are always thinking about their families at home. The Sum of All Fears describes fears of men in all different countries in the Middle East like Israeli, Sea of Galilee. The first part is telling the time and places. Also what the men were doing. The soldiers were involved in Israeli held-Golan Height on Saturday the 6th of October 1973. These are soldiers recounting events. My opinion of The Sum of All Fears is a very good book, for it lets us knowledge about the fears men had have while they in a war. To me a war is a long journey that soldiers go though and have no idea why. I had a first cousion that went into the army and came home after basic trainning then he went on assignment three day later was killed leaving a wife and new baby boy. Only the government knows what the real fight is about. While the media is give misleading information to the public. But The Sum of All Fears was able to let me know some of the things soldiers deal with day-to-day. 
Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies. Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way. The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action. Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?). This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
As someone well versed in various kinds of literature, someone who has read (and enjoyed) almost all of Tom Clancy's novels, and as a professional videographer, I have to say, this is a great flick. For those who are upset about the adaptation, what do you expect? When taking an 800 plus page book and condensing it down to a two hour movie, some things are going to change. The second and third Clancy movies- especially Clear and Present Danger - were also adapted to give Harrison Ford the action spotlight. But now that Ford is ageing, Paramount (who after all, is a business needing to turn a profit) needed to re-invent the franchise. The move to make it not just a new actor, but to show it as the start of Jack Ryan's career was cleverly done. Most of all, it held true to the idea of the book, that when we base our actions off of our fears and suspicions, our peace can be torn apart by a few depraved individuals. This movie falls into the category of action/thriller. As such, not everything is true to life, but instead is designed for entertainment and suspense. And it delivers. For something in the action category it has a remarkably intelligent script. It's a little slow in the beginning for those who are looking for nothing more than explosions and shootouts, but it's worth it. It also has better than average cinematography compared to most action flicks. The effects are well done and not at all cheesy, as many action flicks have taught us to expect. The acting is well-done, with a typically good performance by Affleck and a stellar performance by Freeman. The soundtrack is also fantastic, especially the rendition of the national anthem at the football game. Bottom line, if you're a reader who expects movies scripts to be written like books, don't see this movie. If you accept that literature and movies are entirely different formats of entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie, and it is certainly worth ownin 
Bob Woodward, one of the real-life heroes in the movie, is still making news while reporting news at The Washington Post. That's amazing. I used to be a reporter, and still am a Democrat, (although a moderate now), and I never was a fan of President Nixon, so I loved it when it came out, I loved the book first, and I was glued to the TV set and the papers when the whole Watergate mess unfolded. But ignore politics if you can when watching this...there are crooks in both major parties, and [...], and dumb people promoted above their talents. This is well-written, well directed, and well-acted, and can be enjoyed just as entertainment here in the new century. Sadly, the Clinton Years and the Bush Years, too, offer the realization that Watergate-type conspiracies, designed to hold onto power, avoid scandal, or launder money, are still with us 
You know how every single American English class in ever single school in America has to read at least one Mark Twain book? Well, the same circumstance should be set for this film in relation to modern American history courses. One of the best political thrillers, in all fairness it's not a fast moving film, it's a slow, intricate film full of small details that add up to one big story, and one of the absolute best American films of the 70's All the President's Men is a story of, besides Watergate, of two small worker ants who go on to destroy what already was a disasterous affair, which if not uncovered, could have potentially gotten worse. Hoffman, as per usual, hands in a flawless performance as does Redford, an actor whose work I'm none too familiar with or a fan of, and the supporting cast all around, particularly Jason Robards, shine like flawless diamonds in this essential, and inspirational, drama 
My 12th grade government teacher showed our class this film, and we were all hooked. If you have ever been in a room of thirty some teenagers, you know that its hard to get their attention and keep them quiet. So really, if a bunch of teenagers enjoyed this movie, everyone should consider giving it a chance. It might not be as action packed as some of the movies out today, such as 16 Blocks, but it's gonna keep your attention, so do yourself a favor and atleast rent it, you might find yourself coming back to buy it 
One of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist. Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States. Redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed. He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics. Redford has always been a political animal, with a reporter's instinct, and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the American political climate. Earlier, he and director Michael Ritchie had made THE CANDIDATE, a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women (and a film well worth your time). It took two years of hard work to get ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN off the ground. It was turned down by several studios, with the excuse that people were tired of Watergate, but he was finally able to get Warner Bros. to say yes, provided Redford himself would star. Dustin Hoffman was enlisted to play Carl Bernstein, Redford's old friend Jason Robards won an Oscar as Washington Post Editor-In-Chief Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden was cast as Editor Harry Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam was Editor Howard Simons, Jane Alexander was Judy Hoback, bookkeeper to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (C.R.E.E.P.), Ned Beatty was Martin Dardis, who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence, Stephen Collins was Hugh Sloan, whose wife Debbie (played by Meredith Baxter) kept his conscience working on the right side, Robert Walden (who would go on the the fine television series LOU GRANT) was Dirty Trickster Donald Segretti, and Hal Holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story: the mysterious Deep Throat, who helped Woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall. Of course, we now know that Deep Throat was the FBI's Assistant Director W. Mark Felt, an old friend of Woodward's and a man torn between his loyalty to the FBI and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on. Redford asked Alan J. Pakula to direct and Gordon Willis to handle the cinematography, and they crafted a look that is part documentary, part thriller. (If you get a chance, also see Pakula and Willis' THE PARALLAX VIEW, starring Warren Beatty. Another outstanding, scary political film.) William Goldman, who won an Oscar for BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, wrote the tight, exciting screenplay for which he won again (this was actually the fourth time Redford and Goldman had worked together; Goldman also adapted Donald E. Westlake's THE HOT ROCK, a very funny caper film, and the poignant THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, which was out for a short time on DVD in Pan and Scan, but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful Widescreen splendor. Universal, where are you?) The efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN a smashing success. It succeeds as an exciting, suspenseful procedural, as a statement on the neccessity of a free press, as a character study, and as a great movie-movie. The double-disc DVD set is the one to buy: the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp, clean 1:85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by Redford himself. The second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film, on Woodward and Bernstein, and on Deep Throat. There is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film, and an interview with Jason Robards on the Dinah Shore show. A deserved landmark in film and in journalism, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be, a must-own. In our darkest hour, when all seems obfuscated and hopeless, it reminds us that light can be brought to bear. People CAN make a difference 
Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman deliver Oscar worthy performances, while Jason Robards won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this movie which is (in my opinion) one of the best "political" films ever made. I'm not even sure if it was nominated for Best Picture, but I have to say...This movie was better than "Rocky" OK. The movie won four Academy Awards; The one I mentioned above, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound. It's also rated PG, which is strange because they use the word f**k at least 8 times in this movie and nowadays, two uses can get you slapped with an R rating. But the movie opens as we witness four men breaking into the Watergate Building, which we all know was the setting for Democratic National Headquarters. The police show up and catch the men in the act of setting up survelliance/bugging the place and the story shows up Bob Woodward's (Redford) desk. Woodward is a reporter at The Washington Post who reports the story and then begins to see oddities about it. Why would men break into the Democratic National Headquarters? Who sent them? Etc. Eventually joining in the act of helping him is Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) who begin a thorough investigation of the scandal that begins to turrn up names very high up in government and eventually even The President of the United States, Richard Nixon. Bernstein and Woodward worked their a$$es off to get this story, through apparent death threats and when people wouldn't talk to them, and they got it all right. Robards plays their boss, Ben Bradlee and deserved his Oscar. Another performance that was really good, although his face is almost entirely hidden in shadow is Hal Holbrook as the mysterious Deep Throat. Deep Throat was one of Woodward's informants who apparently worked high up in the government and seemed to know everything about the Watergate cover-up. Except he refused to just give up and information, only hints and could never be directly quoted or even referred to. Woodward, to this day has not given up the identity of Deep Throat or even gave the vaguest idea of who he might've been. Anyway, for a movie about reporters trying to unravel a cover-up, this movie was incredibly entertaining and exciting. It's never boring, it's never dull; both Hoffman Redford play their parts extraordinarily well, which causes us to like the movie even more. And it's strange too, the movie doesn't end with Nixon resigning; but instead ends with Nixon taking his 2nd Oath of Office. We're given the remainder of the details as they're typed up on a Typewriter. I though the ending was abrupt, but perfect. GRADE: A 
The newspaper room was alive and bustling with typewriters, we got an inside look at how reporting, editing, journalism to politics works...blah, blah...and so forth, which brings up an interesting question concerning the health of U.S. democracy under re-emergent conditions of clandestine acts of war consorting with a political machine. Maybe overlooking the theft of American elections should be looked on instead as a humanitarian gesture so that America can avoid succession by assassination like that strung from Kennedy, to Nixon to Regan. Don't ever listen to republican whining over measly office break-ins known as `Watergate'. It is an asinine snow job if ever there was. There is no `conspiracy' in arriving at, opening and then leaving a crime scene unprotected so people claiming to be `reporters' can carry away the evidence on a political assassin and plant any evidence they please, Bremer: More FBI pooh-pooh. There is no such thing as hiring muggers to do police crowd control in Manhattan in 1970. The republican party is an illegal Class C, totalitarian organizing. It should be hauled in and broken up before it pulls its next stunt. It is Clear and Present Danger to national security from totalitarianism. Copping to the lesser charge, actually came after an elaborate effort to posture innocence, when Nixon had to bluster to Flint (the FBI `deep throat' man) while Hoover's successor was away, that the detaining of Bremer should have been more brutal (even swearing for Pete's sake, gosh!). In another instance of primate aggression, Nixon had to thank personally the lunkheads who swung crowbars and wrenches at non-rioting student protestors. This is not a proboscis monkey who should ever have held public office, he would have looked good in stripes, somewhere with plenty of bars. Let me tell'ya, don't ever beat that monkey in a fair election. Not a good idea, and if you're running mate has to be from Texas (due to the way politicians get married off), never choose a man who has Mao and Saddam sized reliefs of himself in his Presidential Library. Why poke fun at his mug handles? Johnson didn't have to worry about `right from wrong', knowing "what `wuz' rite" saves at least half that effort. One of the slush funded wrecking crew perpetrators intimated their non-involvement by whining about Senate investigation asking familiars if he associated with Bremer. Always whine/deny before being put in the position of making denials. Anthropologists are not certain when planning ahead became a neocortex in those primates, but it seems to have put history in a revisionism spell; whining to steal the banana has become multi-dexterous, `five fingered' in its backward and forward directions. Even CBS'ers `Criminal Minds' has profiled the serial killer's habit of arriving early and often at the scene of their own crime, except that the lone assailant, nut-job model seems to be the chapter on criminal law they prefer above all others. Nixon telephoned a rather heated and timely self exoneration without skipping a beat, amazing the `deep-throat' operative Flint with a verbal lapse of decorum. Preemptive monkeyshine is about all I can call it. Flint's in the clear, has written a book and Bob Woodward has published in 2005, titled "The Secret Man". If that isn't good enough culpability, the FBI will take care of the more palpable actus rhesus. I mean actus reus, the non-tangential connection to either avoidance, nonfeasance, obstruction, or crime scene, open house tampering free-for-alls: candlestick, lead pipe, dagger, etc. It's important to improve the profile of the covert operative at the most open invitation to do a little trash removal and apartment restoration. Sort of perfect the identity, oh...write down a few emphatic journal entries...get rid of all the conflicting material and information aligning the agent with the political offense itinerary--Muskie. Did you know our doctrinal separation, supposed to provide the essential element of integrity, accountability, checks and balances has conflicted the appointing of the FBI's director? Not to mention the freaking Supreme Court Justice too!? I'd have to laugh if I didn't own it, along with you. In "The Secret Man", Woodward skips the mess Flint helped bury in the FBI's litter box surrounding the collusion and assistance to loot/alter the Bremer apartment crime scene investigation zone ; but in the original co-authored "All the President's men", Bernstein and Woodward do faithfully report the FBIs bungling in broad daylight with the nest of an obvious member of the slush-funded competition wrecking crew. Poor boy Bremer seemed to be quite the traveler on his measly $1,600 tax income claim, "stalking several candidates". We have Wikepedia the online free encyclopedia to thank for that citation on Arthur Herman Bremer; however their article blames the apartment owner for the ease of access to the press, not the FBI; Bernstein documents the FBI's arrival and then unattendence for an hour and a half--that's when rummaging was conducted by so called `reporters'. An expense account deficit is not a `conspiracy' (in the modern airhead vulgate), it is called evidence, and it is applied all the time in courts of law. Sorry to spoil the big revisionism on the legal entry in Blacks Law Dictionary, 8th, "Conspiracy"--a whole page of wry variations that is not a work of fiction. Woodward telephones Flint, at that time the number two man at the FBI, (media diversion revelation since 9-11 ). Flint won't discuss Watergate, even though they have had prior conversation about the Wallace assassination attempt. Flint says not to call him again, meetings are arranged with an outdoor semaphore and note left in Woodward's morning paper. In the first meeting of the Post's editors we see the demotion of the Bremer-diary story for a story about `McGovern offering the VP spot to everybody' after `The Eagleton Affair'. Never was George Wallace mentioned. Movies distort and attempt to revise history here, with likely planted disinformation. Monetary incentive fits Bremer's apartment doctored profile. The `Watergate'-construct in American history has and will crumble like the cheap plaster it is, similar to the Valarie Plane deception. 
This movie is a great accompaniment to PBS's recent documentary Watergate Plus: 30 Years later. We watched them back to back as PBS aired them this way as well 
President Nixon goes to Congress to address the nation. We see men with flashlights in a dark office building. A watchman notices something wrong, and calls the police. Five men in suits are caught during a burglary. Woodward is sent to cover this arrest. Woodward notices the unusual circumstances about these five, and begins to investigate their backgrounds. The film shows how a telephone was used to do this. You hear the tapping from many typewriters, now as obsolete as the sound of hooves on roads. Bernstein calls the library to get a list of books borrowed by Howard Hunt (do they still give out that information?) The denials point to a cover-up. [Note how paper records leave an audit trail; the current use of computers may prevent this.] Their story doesn't have enough facts for the front page. Woodward makes a phone call to a secret man [who he first called "My Friend"], then gets instructions for a secret meeting. Woodward is told to "follow the money". Bernstein goes to Miami and learns about Mexican checks. One check was given to Maurice Stans, then ended up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar! The film shows how "Wood-Stein" relentlessly search and interview a list of names. [These dollar figures are now way out of date.] Bernstein's low-key questions provide a tutorial on handling a scared witness. Then a tip leads to Segretti and information on more dirty tricks (infiltration of the opposite party). Their report about Haldeman is denied. Woodward meets his secret man and is told whether he is "hot" or "cold". Nixon is re-elected. Woodward and Bernstein continue to follow the story. The Teletype machine begins printing the names of the officials who pled guilty. The last item reports the resignation of Nixon. Was this another case where an experienced politician failed because his public morality did not match his private life? Did this President believe he could do no wrong and those who object are traitors? What is the lesson for today's America if a President illegally wiretaps people? One unanswered question: what was the state of Nixon's sanity? The purpose of the break-in was to plant forged documents showing the Democrats took money from foreign interests. The bugging of telephones was to gather dirty facts that could be used to force someone to appear as a false witness to these documents. Bob Woodward's book "The Secret Man" explains more about this political intrigue in Washington. Woodward spent four years in Naval Intelligence and met important people like the future head of the CIA, and a high-ranking member of the FBI. 
I RENTED THIS VIDEO FROM THE STORE AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PURCHASE IT EVER SINCE -- I EVEN WROTE BUENA VISTA FOR INFO. THE VIDEO IS A SERIES OF OLDER AND NEWER SEGMENTS FROM THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW -- INCLUDING JIM HENSON'S REINDEER MUPPETS DOING A SNOW DANCE AND TOPO GIGIO THE MOUSE SAYING WHAT HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS. IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL ALL-AROUND SELECTION THAT REALLY GETS YOU IN THE HOLIDAY MOOD 
This was a very good film, I had not seen this movie in years. Shipping was fast on this item so I was pleased with that. Overall I was very pleased with the movie and purchase. Oh!, the price was reasonable, for this was a big plus 
100 Rifles will never be considered a great western, but it is a fun watch with plenty of action and a good leading cast. A Phoenix sheriff, Lyedecker, is pursuing a bank robber, Yaqui Joe a half-breed bandit, and ends up finding him in Mexico amidst an uprising. Before Lyedecker can bring him in, he is captured alongside Joe who is wanted for giving rifles to the Yaqui Indians by the Mexican Army. After a narrow escape, Lyedecker forms an uneasy, very uneasy, alliance with Joe to help the Yaquis fight back against the Mexican Army. 100 Rifles is one of many westerns that was released in the late 1960s trying to take advantage of the success of the Italian spaghetti westerns. It has the feel of spaghettis and was filmed in Almeria, but was American financed. All that aside, its a very enjoyable western with plenty of action. Add a great score from Jerry Goldsmith and a great looking print on this new DVD, and you can't miss. Jim Brown stars as Lyedecker, the Phoenix sheriff trying to bring in Yaqui Joe for robbing a bank of $6,000. Brown isn't considered a great actor, but he's very good here. The man simply has a great presence on screen. Burt Reynolds plays Yaqui Joe, a half-breed bandit trying to give rifles to the Yaqui Indians. His part gives him some very funny lines, and together with Brown, they make a great duo. Raquel Welch plays Sarita, the love interest who fights alongside the men. She has a love scene with Brown, that at the time seemed shocking, but its pretty tame. As expected, Ms. Welch looks amazing, and director Tom Gries gives the viewer plenty of chances to oggle her. Fernando Lamas plays the evil Verdugo, the Mexican officer charged with wiping out the Yaquis while Eric Braeden offers advice as Von Klemme, a German advisor. This long-overdue DVD offers a great looking widescreen presentation considering the movie is almost 40 years old, three picture galleries with about 60-70 photos, a 100 Rifles trailer, and trailers for three other 20th Century Fox westerns. So if you're a fan of westerns, check out Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds, and Raquel Welch in the action-packed 100 Rifles 
100 Rifles is the kind of Western you'd have expected someone to make in the late 1960's. One with a black US lawman, and two revolutionary Mexican Indians fighting for justice in their oppressed homeland. It would be easy to dismiss this as a politically correct western, even though it was made before the term was invented. But the cast and the production of 100 Rifles pulls it off, making a rare late 60's Western treat. Jim Brown, recently retired football superstar, plays the US marshall with the virility and muscle that befits his status as one of the greatest, and definitely the most punishing running bakc in the history of the NFL. Burt Reynolds and Raquel Welch plays the two revolutionaries. Brown's cahracter comes to Mexico chasing bank robbing Reynolds, ends up falling for Welch, and eventually helps both Reynolds and Welch with their revolutionary activities. Reynolds displays all of the vigor and charm that helped become the most popular box office star in the late seventies/early eighties, and Welch is, well Welch, oozing sex appeal and sensuality. 100 Rifles is definitely a product of the era in which it was made, but since there very few great Westerns made in the late 60's except movies like Hombre and The Wild Bunch, this is film to appreciate and treasure 
from the classic mid '60s-early '70s era of offbeat 'n' out-of-control Euro-style Mexico-set westerns, with a script co-written by Clair Huffaker: oppressed Yaqui Indians vs. the Mexican government ....... perhaps Jim Brown's best film performance (and where are DVDs of 'Riot', '...tick...tick...tick...', 'El Condor' and 'Three the Hard Way'?), with Burt Reynolds, Raquel Welch plus a bit part appearance by Soledad Miranda ....... this is LONG overdue for release on DVD. Special Edition with extras, please 
When is this movie going to DVD? This one is the best of all the Racquel Welch Westerns--It has plenty of action and great storyline--The best part with Racquel is when she is taking a shower from a railroad water tank to confuse the Mexican soldiers that are on a passing train--who cannot help but look? She is dressed but the clothes are tight!!! What a scene!!! Plenty of action in this movie-especially the love scene with Jim Brown--this along with Bandeloro are the best--get them both---DVD PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I wasnt even born yet when this film came out but it was great. Great in the sense of good actors(Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds and Fernando Lamas), good performance, good sountrack once more and action-western, what could be better?......Not until last year 2003 did I know that Victor Newman(Young and the Restless) was the Fernando Lamas's right hand man in the film!!!! What a shock!! 
This is a somewhat underrated action film set during the Mexican Revolution with James Brown as a deputy who crosses the border to bring back Burt Reynolds for the stolen 100 rifles. Eventually Brown and Reynolds get involved in the Revolution through Raquel Welch . Brown and Reynolds play well off each other as they go up against Fernando Lamas and his Federal army. Director Tom Gries put together some great action sequences. That combined with Jerry Goldsmith's score makes for a film that really delivers. Hans Gudegast (Eric Braeden) brilliantly underplays his part as a German military advisor to Lamas. This film helped launch Burt Reynolds into stardom 
To understand why our contact with the news is so limited, and how it's selected, watch this far-reaching documentary about the difference between "free" and "fascist" societies--the latter able to coerce public cooperation with force, the former forced to shape public opinion through ownership and control of the media. Though there are signs that Chomsky's message is finally getting through to some of today's television commentators, the extent of the media's manipulation of our consciousness is probed by reporting this "lone voice crying in the wilderness. 
I recently bought this DVD and was really looking forward to seeing it. Halfway I stopped watching it. Disappointing 
I saw this documentary in the 90's and it opened my eyes. Every human being on this earth should see this documentary and rethink it's role in human history. Noam Chomsky is a model. Humam, but a model 
Get the DVD.It has the whole show that Chomsky did with that windbag William Buckley.Shows clearly why there is practically no real debate ever in the media.Also, FYI ,check out the debate Chomsky did with another windbag ,Richard Perle,back in 1988 at Ohio State University for further proof.I am rewriting this because I just learned that you can't tell someone where to find something so you are on your own here in locating the chomsky /perle debate 
"I gather there are some people beyond that darkness out there, but if I don't look you in the eye it's because I don't see you, I only see the darkness." That quote is found toward the beginning of "Manufacturing Consent" and is taken from a lecture Chomsky was about to give in an auditorium where apparently no house lights were available. I'm unsure if anything more revealing was intended by Chomsky's opening comment, although it's impossible not to read something more into it. The breadth of information offered in "Manufacturing Consent" is manifold, shedding light on two primary subjects. One: Noam Chomsky, his life, childhood, his anarchist convictions which fueled his decision early on to place a lesser degree of import on an easy going, comfortable career in linguistics in favor of an uncertain, often tumultuous life of political activism and dissent. Two: The oligarchy in which existence is ensnared. The necessary illusions which are implemented to deceive and brainwash the populace, tricking them into believing that they actually have a representative form of democratic government and indeed have a hand in decision making policy. And of course, the media; a broad apparatus used to manufacture the people's consent, ensuring that an appropriate percentage of the populace will be effectively indoctrinated and hoodwinked into supporting the agenda of the ruling class and its military power, or, will be effectively depoliticized, tuned out and away from crucial matters which directly impact the quality of social and individuated life. Most of what is seen on television, be it news, sports, situation comedies, movies, whatever the programming, serve as little more than an advertisement for a specific mindset resulting in a strategically wished for outcome. At one point someone asks Chomsky "how do the elites control the media?" He replies, "how do elites control GM? ...because they own it." Look at institutional power as an entity: they have their own "news" division. In fact, it's THEE news division. Naturally those who comprise this power structure at all of its various levels understand that to serve the proper role, especially if one wishes to "get ahead" is *not* to actively undermine the structure's agenda by telling the truth and revealing its own crimes. "Manufacturing Consent" is a remarkable film. You see Chomsky interacting with all sorts of people, students, interviewers, average people who he's inspired, and even those who obviously despise him for daring to speak a truth which conflicts with prevailing (media induced) ideology, one that their own self deceptive belief structure demand be untrue in order to maintain a delusional, happy consciousness. As Chomsky asks, "do the facts matter, or don't they?" For him it comes down to a single question: Can you look at yourself in the mirror? Another telling moment comes when Chomsky is asked to recall a childhood incident which left an indelible impression. He tells of a time where the standard fat kid was being picked on at the playground with everyone taunting him as someone's older brother was on the way to beat him up, and Chomsky was impelled to do the right thing, so he went and stood next to the fat kid as a display of solidarity, but was eventually intimidated and walked away. He says the shame he felt for doing so never went away, has always stayed with him, and that the lesson learned was to never do that again, and that you always stand with the underdog. "As any change must begin somewhere, it is the single individual who will experience it and carry it through." ~ Carl Jung 
Great insights; worth the time and money; wateched it many times and always see something ne 
I have seen the original Dutch version by Director Sluizer, and this one holds up quite well on its own. Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) stops at a gas station with his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). In a matter of minutes, she disappears without a trace. And although Jeff searches everywhere for her, she vanishes without ever being heard from again. He lives every moment of his life trying to locate her. Putting flyers everywhere, and even going on TV. The abducter of Diane is Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). I don't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her, however, I will write that Barney contacts Jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate Diane after so many years. He gives Jeff a chance to experience what happened to Diane, but at a cost. Enter Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) who is also the latest love interest of Jeff. Her role in the film is very important. Barney Cousins is a sociopath, and he has been abducting women for some time. How long, the viewer is never told, but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction. He is very methodical. As I wrote in the beginnig, I have seen the original, and while it is quite good, this film also is a very good and suspenseful film. The character of the sociopath, played by Jeff Bridges is very good. He is very convincing in his part. As for Kiefer Sutherland, I thought he gave a very good performance. Disregard some of the negative reviews on this film. Just because the original is on Criterion, and in Dutch, does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film. I have the DVD, but it is only listed on VHS at amazon. It might be out of print. If you can, grab the DVD; I assure you that you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 4.5] 
An extraordinary film, The Vanishing, brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the American Northwest. The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category. Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot (Jeff's strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 
This movie starts a little slow, but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller. Bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little "thing" that just makes him creepy. Typical of an early 90s thriller, this movie is sure to entertain. If you liked "Fear" then you will like "The Vanishing" as well 
George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered. Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one. 
In 1988, director George Sluizer had directed a film entitled, THE VANISHING. The film was all in Dutch and starred Dutch actors, who are nowhere near well-known in this country. In 1993, director George Sluizer, who had directed the original Dutch film, had decided to direct a remake of his own film, this time, casting a well-known cast that consists of Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Bridges. The film is almost the same as the original Dutch version, but this one is much more worth the time and money. JEFF HARRIMAN (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend, DIANE SHAVER (played by Sandra Bullock) are driving to the mountains for vacation. They have a little spout, after their car runs out of gas, while in a dark tunnel. Leaving Diane there, Jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station. He comes back to find Diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel, upset and distraught. They pull into a gas station, where Diane has Jeff, who laughs with cheerfulness, repeat an apology. They kiss passionately, where Diane heads into the store to buy her and Jeff some cold beers. A half-hour goes by and Diane has not yet returned. He searches the store, as well as the whole ground, but Diane is nowhere to be found. Three years later, Jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend. Every month for the last three years, Jeff would renew the posters he had printed of Diane. He has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped Diane to tell him where she is. He walks into a diner one night, still very miserable, and meets RITA BAKER (played by Nancy Travis). Rita is instantly attracted to Jeff. Jeff and Rita begin a love affair together. Jeff tries to move on with his life, but he cannot, for he is still searching for Diane. Rita finds out about what Jeff is doing behind her back. She tries to help get over his obsession, but it doesn't work. Jeff receives a letter from a man named BARNEY COUSINS (played by Jeff Bridges). Jeff shows Rita the letter, but she realizes that his obsession is still going on, where she leaves him. She goes to their appartment, packs her things, changes the outgoing message on their answering machine. Jeff returns home and changes the machine himself, but as the recording is still going, Barney appears. Jeff beats the hell out of him, but Barney reveals that he can tell him where Diane is, and that in order for Jeff to find out what happened to her, he'd have to ride with Barney. While at a bar with her girlfriend, Rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message, but Rita hears that Jeff had already changed it, to which she finds Barney's voice on the machine. She realizes that Jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him, but Jeff and Barney are already on their way. Rita finds out what happened from her neighbor, where her neighbor gives Rita the license plate number to Barney's car. With this License Plate #, Rita finds out where Barney lives and drives off to his place. Jeff and Barney arrive at the gas station where Diane was last seen three years earlier. Barney hands Jeff a cup of coffee, where Barney informs Jeff that the coffee is drugged. He tells Jeff that in order to find out what happened to Diane, Jeff has to go through the exact same details that Diane had gone through. Jeff, through hurtful tears, drinks the coffee and blacks out. He wakes up to darkness. He flips on his lighter to find himself locked...in a coffin and...buried alive outside Barney's vacation cabin in the woods. Barney had done this to poor Diane, who, after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid, is now dead. Rita arrives at Barney's house, where she meets Barney's daughter, DENISE (played by Maggie Linderman). She asks Rita to giver her a ride to the carnival, as long as she doesn't say a word to to Barney. Rita asks Denise how to get to the summer cabin where Barney is at. Denise gives her the directions and Rita is on her way. She arrives and has a brief brawl with Barney. She stops when he is about to kill her. She is now seated inside his cabin, talking with Barney, trying to find out what he did with Jeff. She notices the dirt on his shoes, the dirt on a shovel, standing beside the door, and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass, and realizes that Barney had buried Jeff alive. She knocks Barney and begins digging up Jeff. But not before Barney awakens and begins brawling again with Rita. Did Jeff suffocate and bite the dust as Diane had done? Will Barney kill of Rita as well? The only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of THE VANISHING. I have read the reviews from many Amazon.com reviewers and I cannot believe that anyone would hate this remake. So what? The ending was changed. I do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie. This movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake. Kiefer Sutherland, again, proves that he is the best actor on this planet, maybe even in this whole galaxy. This movie is one Kiefer's best starring roles and I recommend it to any Kiefer Sutherland fan who has not yet seen this film 
This movie maybe a remake, but it keeps you at the edge of your seat. You don't ever want to get up. You always want to know what is going to happen next. It is a great mystery and it is very realistic! 5 stars for a great movie 
Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD? Seriously? The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's. This isn't a matter of comparison. This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie. Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie. And the ending. Oh, the ending. We've been cheated. Totally cheated. All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome. Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK! Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated. This is [...]of a great movie. 
I glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is "intellectual" because it is made anywhere but the USA. In their eyes America can do no right. My other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame.

I never really watched CSI: Miami before I tried out Unbox but I decided to try it with the $0.01 promotion. It turns out it's really, really good and now it's one of my favorite shows. Seriously, this must be the best looking show on TV. It has interesting crimes, lots of action, fast cars, good mysteries and David Caruso is a very strong lead. I think the camerman should be one of the highest paid people on the show because it looks awesome. I think the thing this show needs for it to go to the next level is for someone from the suporting cast to emerge as a young, sexy star equal in stature to Horatio and a counterpoint to him in the stories. But I guess I will leave those decisions to Jerry Bruckheimer 
These early thirties films labelled as "Pre Code", are always most interesting to watch from a historical perspective as only a few years after this film was made such a topic would never have been able to be presented as it is here. The passage of time of course makes the subject matter of MGM's "The Divorcee", seem tame however back in 1930 this story was considered very adult and almost ahead of its time in its fairly honest examination of the "expected", roles for husbands and wives in the marital situation. Norma Shearer who today is sadly not well known really proved her acting chops in this vehicle and went home with the Best Actress Oscar that year for her troubles. Often labelled quite restrictively as the dignified first lady of MGM resulting from much of her later work in this decade in husband Irving Thalberg's prestige productions; here proves what she was capable of doing on screen when given meaty roles to tackle. Her other effort from this time "A Free Soul", makes a nice companion piece to "The Divorcee", in illustrating the range of roles Shearer was capable of handling when examining her overall career. 
The Divorcee was made in the 1930s but well before the Hayes censorship code. The movie pushes double entendres and seuxal situations to the limit but does it with astonishing taste and wit. You know what's going on but since the movie assumes you're an adult it doesn't spell it out for you. The beautiful Norma Shearer plays Jeri, a bold, tough girl who most of the audience immediately identifies with. She falls in love with Ted. Their relationship is wild, passionate and exciting. Jeri continues with her career after the marriage and that's swell with Ted. Then Ted messes up and has a drunken fling with a woman who's not even on Jeri's level. He excuses himself by saying that the fling "doesn't mean a thing." Jeri, is NOT mollified and in a cleverly shot scene she pays Ted back in kind. You see Jeri and Ted's best friend. We see a close up of Jeri's face. She looks burnt out, furious and totally unlike herself. She smiles at her husband's best friend and then a window shade is drawn and the lights go out. Next scene is Jeri looking very pale and tired walking into her front door. You know immediately where she's been and what's she's done. When she tells Ted that she's settled their account it takes Ted a minute to figure out what she means but when he does the expression of horror and disallusionment on his face is done so well. Jeri and Ted divorce and both fling themselves into affairs in order to forget each other. A montage follows where all you see is Jerri's hand with the hands of various other men with snippets of voiced over racy dialouge. One memorable line is Jeri's response to a French lover, "I dont speak French but I know that's not high blood pressure!" Finally, Jeri faces facts. She still loves Ted and he still loves her and she decides to get him back. Norma looks gorgeous in this movie and the sets are a love song to old Manhattan.If you've seen Norma in The Women or love 1930s movies do check this one out. 
When, oh when, can we see a better quality print of THE DIVORCEE? When will we see its release on DVD? Maybe if Shearer had had costars with more star wattage than Chester Morris and Robert Montgomery it would have been out long ago! However everything else being equal, I wouldn't trade Morris and Montgomery for Gable and Leslie Howard! Each man is perfect in his part and Chester Morris, if you ask me, is a real find. I sort of remember him in his vintage years, kind of a wsie-cracking Oscar Levant type, but hete he is sexy, rough, rather an animal, i.e., perfect casting opposite Norma Shearer, who always seemed to respond well to "brutes" and of course to give as good as she got. I'm afraid Robert Montgomery just isn't up to her (and Chester's) brand of animal magnetism--not just yet--later on of course Robert Montgomery forged his own signature acting menace, revealing an iron hand behind a velvet glove. However THE DIVORCEE is primarily a showcase for Shearer, and her many fans, new and old, will revel in the way she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and starts all over again. I can only imagine what a stir her acting must have caused in its day. She's very powerful, and she does it all with facial expressions and the tiniest gestures of her long, lean body and the wonderfully expressive costumes the designers put her in. Watch her as she pulls a bit of lint from her sleeve just as her husband delivers a crushing speech to her. You don't see it in her eyes, you see her hurt in the pincing motions of her thumb and fingers 
Does anyone know when will this movie come out on DVD? I would like to see all Norma's movies on DVD including the cardboard lover 
Having always loved films from the 30's, I've recently re-discovered the delightful Norma Shearer. I find her to be quite a good actress, and found this film to be very entertaining. Allowing for the 70+ years since it was made, it's amazing to see how single women were treated in those days as opposed to now. Some of it is comical where it wasn't meant to be for just that reason, but Norma shines through. And Robert Montgomery, her perpetual co-star, is quite good, even though he's played this same personality in so many of her films. Norma Shearer was called the "Queen of MGM" because she was married to Irving Thalberg, but I think she'd have been the success she was without him 
This is one of my favourite movies of the '30s. I love everything about this film - the smart, fashionable sets and fashions - the sexy, snappy plot - the black and white photography which just shines (great for watching late at night with all the lights out). Norma Shearer gives a terrific performance - surprisingly modern and natural, and the film moves along at a fast pace and never dulls. I won't give away the plot - which still holds relevance today in marraige or partnership (the double standard tackled in this film is still around). As for the ending - its perfect! You wouldn't want it any other way. A previous reviewer has stated that the ending of the film rather spoiled it for her - that it contradicted the feminism apparent in earlier scenes. However, what we have here is both partners accepting the other's flaws - and if it seems that its Norma's character making all the effort that's just because she is the stronger of the two (made obvious throughout the movie - while her ex husband drinks himself into unemployment her love life and career goes from strength to strength). Ultimately though, this movie is a fascinating and daring (for its day) insight into sexual politics (MGM-style) among the smart set in the early thirties, and has to be viewed as such by a modern viewer. And above all else - this movie is fun! If you're a fan of vintage Hollywood then you should love this movie 
If you are fans of Norma Shearer and Chester Morris, this IS the movie for you.......An Absolutely entertaining film from beginning to end....This is the movie which started my interest in collecting Chester Morris films on video....a very good actor who I would say didn't get the recognition he truly deserved..and Norma Shearer, a truly beautiful and gifted actress.. 
I liked it better then "Ran". Deep visual and dramatic expression. Leaves you thinking about it for days. 
Throne of Blood is a masterpiece by one of the world's greatest film makers at the height of his powers. Only Kurosawa could take the essence of Shakespearian stage drama and incorporate it into the medium of film as a dynamic tour de force. Yet at the same time he remains faithful to elements of Noh (a stagy traditional Japanese play-form in which design and movement are minimalized). A seeming contradiction, dynamism and static-ness yet Kurosawa masters both in the same medium. As usual; acting, writing, cinematography, sound, direction and production are all pitch perfect. In this second Shakespearian based film by Kurosawa, focus is on the interplay of fate, free will and the fine thread the human psyche uses to weave the two together. On a more simpler level it is a man living and dying by the sword. In short what goes around comes around. What comes around for Toshiro Mifune as he gets his just deserts is a scene with straight as an arrow, perfect direction by Kurosawa leading to quite a pointed culminatin of events (pun intended...see the movie you'll understand). Bonus features include excellent linear notes as well as the superb commentary of Donald Richie. Few people are more knowledgeable about film and Japanese film then he. The commentary is almost as interesting as the movie itself. As usual Criterion presents its film in pristine condition. Some may complain that Criterion is too pricey but with them you get the best cinema has to offer. You cannot go wrong. One Kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy, punch and philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times the movie at 5 times the price, really quite a deal if you look at it that way. 
Macbeth comes to Japan, and although it's set in feudal times and sometimes has the feel of a classic Noh play, Kurosawa borrows freely from Shakespeare: there are the prophecies of an evil spirit; there's Lady Macbeth feeding the fire of her husband's ambition and madly trying to wash the blood off her hands; and, of course, there's Birnam woods moving toward the castle at the end. Toshiro Mifune is Macbeth, and the final scene as he's barraged with countless arrows is a classic. Isuzu Yamada is Lady Macbeth, and she puts in a virtuoso performance of frightening proportions. The movie is very atmospheric - foggy woods, braying horses, an eerie musical score - that only adds to its intensity; but it's also poetic and moving in its own unique way. It's a brilliant piece of filmmaking. [I identify the characters using Shakespeare's play; in the movie they have Japanese names. 
When it comes to film adaptations, most films fail in some way. To think that a Japanese film director could transform one of the greatest plays written in the English language and mke it his own, is quite tremendous. To think that he could use Japanese Noh theater images to enhance the adpatation is a stroke of genius. Mifune is one of the greatest actors to play Macbeth, and dare say maybe the best. Akira Kurosawa directed a masterpiece and proves why he is at the top of the pantheon of great world directors. And, of course, The Criterion Collection folk out do themselves, again. Thank goodness for them, because of it wasn't for them, we all would be missing out on great films. 
Kurosawa and Noh do Macbeth with so much less language (not that I do not like Shakespeare's poetry) and so much more physical expression, that I doubt that I will not be able to read the play again without imagining Mifune as I read Will. 
In this 1957 film directed by Akira Kurosawa, Lord Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Lord Miki (Akira Kubo) encounter a spirit in a maze-like forest that prophesies great things for the two comrades: the former will someday rule the imposing Spider's Web Castle and the latter will take his friend's position as commander of the First Fortress. Even beyond that, the spirit predicts that Miki's son will one day succeed Washizu as the master of Spider's Web Castle. Although the two men are initially reluctant to trust the spirit's words, preliminary parts of the prophecy come to pass, thus setting into motion a bloody chain of events that explores the differences between active and passive destiny. Lady Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), Washizu's scheming wife, prods her husband to seize the reigns of power at any cost. She insists that Washizu's only restraint is his own ambition and that heaven itself had preordained his rise. Here, of course, is where the trouble begins. Asaji is initially convinced of the legitimacy of the spirit's words and points out to her husband that without his doing anything, part of the prophecy had come to pass. She then declares that Washizu must take the next step of killing the Great Lord in order to fulfill his destiny. And yet there is an obvious question that arises at this point...Miki's son, skeptical of the prospect of his succession to the throne of Spider's Web Castle, tells his father that the spirit's prophecy is only coming true because he and Washizu took it upon themselves to make it so; was it fate or was it a series of man-made coincidences? Asaji paradoxically takes both views as she becomes enraged at the thought of Miki's son and his posterity being the ones to benefit most from Washizu's deeds. Now discounting the inevitability of the spirit's words, Asaji demands that Washizu put an end to Miki and his son to clear the way for their own unborn child. Will Washizu trust the spirit and remain passive or will he actively take matters into his own hand? Will he succeed in rebuffing the spirit and shaping his own destiny or will he fail and fulfill the prophecy anyway? The film itself is excellently done (it doesn't get much better than Mifune and Kurosawa working together) and as with most Criterion Collection DVDs, this one is filled with extras. My favorite feature is the two separate English-language subtitlings. The first is a bit more literary and not quite as literal (I'm so clever sometimes). The second is more conservative and stays closer to a truly accurate translation. Compare these sentences: "he has imbibed too freely" as opposed to "he has had too much wine." Because this is a period drama, the first feels more appropriate to me, especially since the status-based honorifics of Japanese culture (-san, -sama, -dono, etc.) generally lend themselves to older modes of the English language when translating them. The more lyrical translation can be a bit much at times, however, so I can certainly understand why someone would be inclined to prefer the more accurate one. Though I was not particularly enthusiastic about the price-tag of this film, I was satisfied with the results. Highly recommended to all those with a penchant for high quality cinema 
I was enormously fascinated by the film "The Throne of Blood" we just watched as part of our pre-AP English course in Nagoya International School, Japan. The film adopts the plot of Shakespeare's Macbeth with a Japanese setting. Macbeth is characterized as a Japanese warrior, the head of the 1st fort. After the victory, he sees a spirit (the witch-equivalent) in the forest on his way to the shogun's castle. As he has predicted, he was awarded the prestigious status of the head of the castle. The king decided to visit his castle one day to organize a plan to kill the Banquo-equivalent character. He is extremely proud of the trust that the king has in order to arrange such an important event, but his wife believes that the king insists on killing him instead. The big gap between his optimism and his wife's pessimism leads him to the road of Tragedy. I believe the director of the film could easily adopt the setting very similar to that of the original Macbeth, thanks to the similarities in the feudal system of Japan and Scotland. Japan also believed in the existence of spirits and how the nobleman was ranked in status was similar to that of Scotland. Kurosawa would've struggled creating The Throne of Blood if he, for example, adopted dynastic China or the Kingdom of Thailand as the scene instead of Japan. All of the characters in "The Throne of Blood" successfully and accurately emulated the characters in the Shakespearean version. Although there were some changes in their persona (such as the Lady Macbeth character was a more modest figure than the original), all characters kept their qualities, tendencies and their role. To people whom read Macbeth in the past, this movie is definitely worth the watch. Viewers can receive the same impression and the excitement of Macbeth with a totally different setting. Koy 
One man's life with full of ups and downs is pictured in the film, "The Throne of Blood", directed by Akira Kurosawa. This film is a Japanese re-make version of the famous Shakespearean play, Macbeth. Because this film is a Japanese film, many details differ from Macbeth, although the basic plot of the story is the same. All the plot changes, character and setting differences are effective choices for this film because it adds a different taste to the original form of the story. Most plot changes in the film due to cultural differences make the plot in this film natural and flowing, with a little twist at the end. Some detailed plot adaptations that the director had to make included Washizu (playing the role of Macbeth) taking over the Cob-web castle, Miki (playing the role of Lady Macbeth) being pregnant and Washizu being killed by his own men towards the end of the story. In medieval Japan, a man taking over a castle did not necessarily mean that he can be the Emperor of Japan, unlike Macbeth aiming to be the King from the start. Therefore, Washizu did not kill the Emperor, but he had to kill the others competing for the castle. However, the conflicts between Washizu and the other competent is similar to Macbeth's because the goal that they both had in mind was to achieve power. In this film, Miki's pregnancy does not seem to have a dramatical change in the plot of the story, but is thought to be necessary for this Japanese film. The reason for this is because the couple wanted their own child to inherit his throne after his death. This inheriting system is similar to the one in Macbeth, but this director decided to add this detail in to reveal the great desires of Washizu. After all of the killing and the struggles to take over the castle, Washizu did not want any other person but his child who shares his blood to inherit the throne. The climax of this film comes when hundreds of soldiers by Washizu's side points their arrows at him and one by one hits him. This is another plot adaptations that has been made for this film because the soldiers wanted to show the sign of surrender. Giving Washizu's head represented surrender. This change made the film more violent thus added a twist with an unexpected ending. In making changes, it is very important that the plot flows and that it is natural. This sort of change is needed because there is no fun in a film or story that is completely same from the original form. The main character, Washizu is very different from the characteristic that Macbeth has. Washizu is brave, confident, demanding and more selfish than the Shakespearean Macbeth. A Shogun (similar position as the Thane when referring to Macbeth) has to be strong, determined and brave to take over a castle. Unlike Macbeth, he was demanding his wife and the tone of his speech was overall strong. The director probably wanted to express the image of a brave man going through one straight road towards his goal, but ending with a tragic death. This is maybe a typical image of a Shogun during the medieval Japan. One thing that is not expressed because of this characterization of Washizu, is the gradual change of Washizu the beginning to the end of the story. This is an important change to express because in Macbeth, he is growing to become more aggressive and greedy as he overcomes the obstacles to become the King. Similarly, Miki's characterization is different form Lady Macbeth too. Lady Macbeth was a pretty strong woman, telling her husband what to do. However, Miki was not like her because she was under a circumstance where she cannot, since Washizu was a demanding person. But overall, the two characters played the Japanese actors were very well suited for this version of Macbeth. "The Throne of Blood" was set in medieval Japan, when Shoguns from each castle fought to prove the strongest castle and warlords. this setting is very suited to fit a story like Macbeth into. Both setting has Lords, Emperor/King, and warriors. This made it possible for details to be expressed in the film. An example of one detail is one of the three apparitions that the old lady, gave to Washizu. When the old lady told him that he will be victorious unless the wood nears the neighbor comes down to Washizu's castle. Since medieval castle in Japan were constructed on the top of the fort and used forests and woods as one of the protection and security methods, this apparition was realistic. The director chose Japan as the setting of this film, probably because many things matched with the original setting. Technically, it is a completely different setting but it is good enough to reproduce a similar story which is very impressive. If people who have never seen or heard about Macbeth happens to see "The Throne of Blood" will not think that this film is a reproductive of a Shakespearean play. This is how almost perfectly Macbeth and The Throne of Blood matches. The changes were made rather to improve the film. Washizu and Macbeth, both who lived a fast and tragic life possess a lifestyle that people today can still learn and achieve from. That is the power of films and stories. "The Throne of Blood" will always be the classical and perfect example of a successful reproductive film. 
If I could make one change to this movie, it would be near the end when Angel (Isaac Hayes) tells what happened to each of the characters...I would have added a brief cameo of Muriel (played brilliantly by Rosie Perez) getting her just desserts...I would show Muriel, working in a nail salon, with a bitter look on her face, slamming things around, with a rude customer barking orders at her. Other than that, great movie! 
What a disappointment! I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy. Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never. Very predictable plot from beginning to end. And Rosie Perez was truly offensive. A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying. There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other. Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language. Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene. It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way. I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners. Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler] But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
Light-hearted rendition of the true-to-life story of a police officer who was forced by his conscience to share his lottery winnings with a waitress, fulfilling a promise he made when he was otherwise unable to leave a tip. Presents the ways in which sudden prosperity changes people, for the better or worse. A little sappy in order to please the ladies; a little action and a good story so as to please everyone - even us 'macho guys'. 
It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day. The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all. Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong. Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
May be you don' t believe it, but from time to time, there are certain poetic films that would seem to recover its majesty even in the most unexpected circumstances. The plot is a fairy tale indeed, but in last instance, who cares about it ?. The final intentions are precisely what it counts. A winning lottery ticket will become the sparkling breach to narrate a story that surely will enchant you. A marriage in disgrace due both of them would seem to talk by different TV channels. His marriage is far to be a dialogue, but an exchange of monologues. A honest man, a good guy, a candid man, is a cop in NYC, an ambitious wife; a disillusioned woman plenty of good feelings who suddenly will meet one each other in this little picture of low budget perhaps, but loaded of spring vision. There will be a gradual, very emotive and absolutely expected love affair between these solitaire souls, that will experience certainly new, varied, encountered and cruel emotions. I have always been engaging with Bridget Fonda as actress. She possesses that delirious touch just reserved to a few artists. She illuminates the screen with her mesmerizing sidereal beauty ornamented with her nave smile; she is a lovely and very talented artist who stole the show along the picture. Rosie Perez is fine as the ambitious wife and the great Seymour Cassel as the elegant Jack Gross is terrific. Nicholas Cage in one of his best performances ever; very natural and credible in that character The script has no fissures, the frame is the always changing City of the World and the fit camera of Andrew Bergman, will allow to reconcile us with the life through this unusual film, without special effects, free of violence, chase cars and sensationalist explosions. I swear it. A beauty parable of the Good Samaritan, and the expected boomerang reaction of the community respect this very weird behavior. The Angel 's device is imported from "The wings of desire". And the final shot of the red balloon floating over Central Park is a well deserved homage to Albert Lamouirise ` s The Red Balloon. 
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
I got the fortune of watching this movie when it was reraned on Showtime. I never liked anything I seen that had Nicolas Cage, but watching this movie made me change my mind about the guy. This movie is excellent from beginning to end. Another solid 1990s love story, where wins and loss of lottery doesn't change a person's attitude 
If you want to believe, don't bother reading this. After much anticipation, I just finished viewing Temple of Doom and found it a dissapointment. Indy's 2-dimensional companions "Willie" and "Shorty" seemed to toggle between desparate comic diversion and self-serving audience identification. The main villian spouted exotic gibberish to some styrofoam god gave the term "heart wrenching" a new definition. The insects were slimy also. I'm sorry- it may be my 12" TV or maybe I am in a cranky mood, but I found this movie to be a skeleton from the 80s best locked away 
"Raiders of a lost ark" was a thrill. I mean the suspense was just brilliant and the story was packed with surprises. This movie is not like that at all. You don't get the excitement you did in "Raiders". What's more it's scary, and I mean almost disturbing. The ceremonial scene is creepy, the candles are freaky and it looks like this could really be happening somewhere in a dark place. The movie deals with truly disturbing adult themes such as evil, drug addiction, witchcraft, child abuse, and torture. In "Raiders" you knew it was just a story. However, the scare in "doom" is not so much "jumpy" like in "Raiders", it is an uneasy feeling that sticks to you as soon as you enter the horrible hell hole. The intorduction of the chinese kid brings a lot of fun but the woman is irassible, and Dr Jones not convincing as a possessed by evil Indiana. The idea that children are working as slaves is definitely not a funny one. The roller coaster rides however really add a tone to the movie, they are cool, but a few scenes are downright fake. For example, the scene where the ceiling with spikes comes down is so false: it looks like it 's only about two meters and as soon as it is close to them, Spielberg lifts it up again to give time to the woman. Another example, the crocodile scene obviously shot in different locations because when taken from profile it looks like Indiana and his goons are standing on a little bridge over a creek. The guru character was not an interesting one, and the image that this film gives on Indians is more of a political one rather than a mysterious one, and I don't like this image. But,...the beginning of the movie is one of the best action thriller beginnings of all time and just for uhe first aprt up to the point where the trio arrive in India, the movie deserves to be watched. 
"Temple of Doom" is an exciting adventure story in the classic mold: exotic locations, thoroughly evil bad guys, wild chases, bloodless fights, and chaste romantic interest. There's a lot to like here, right down to the happy family reunions (!) at the end. It's a sequel to the instant success of "Lost Ark". That's logical, given the popularity of the original and the versatility of the Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) character. This movie suffers a bit from the sequel syndrome, though. The "screaming babe" and "cute kid" characters are almost perfunctory - her job is mostly to squawk and get saved, the kid's job is mostly cuteness. Well, they do good enough jobs in their roles. Also, the Indiana character is developing in the direction of a James Bond - the first scene is in a high-priced cabaret, with Indy in an evening suit. Is that really our Indy? There's a lot more humor than in the first movie, and that generally works well. The opening scene, an almost-familair cabaret song, prepares the viewer for later oddness. The initial scramble across the cabaret floor, too, is a good display of physical humor. "Temple of Doom" never seems to develop a split personality because of the disparate elements, though. They alternate well, without distracting from each other. On the whole, this has stood up to the test of time. (Is it really 20 years since this came out?) The adventure story is good, the effects are all they need to be, and the mind can shift to low gear while watching. Enjoy! //wiredweir 
The "now standard Indiana" formula is there and there are a lot of fun parts to this movie. However the bad guys are too bad and the situation is too spooky. Be sure to watch "Riders of the Lost Ark" first even thought this takes place chronologically earlier. Once again James Bond has nothing on Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) as he negotiates for a treasure and is double crossed at every turn, barely escaping with his life, also the acquisition of a steriotipical blond singer Wilhelmina Scott (Kate Capshaw), and his new sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan). In his hasty retreat he does not realize that there are greater forces at work insuring that he fulfill his destiny to recover a sacred object and all the children of a beleaguered village. Is he up to the challenge? In this case does being blond help or hinder? Will Short Shot prove that size does not matter? Take heart! Be prepared for a dark passage "a little too dark for my taste". 
The scene opens in Shanghai, where incredibly sexy Wilhelmina (Willie) Scott (Kate Kapshaw) leads a stunning cabaret dance, only to be stolen by Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) , together with a very precious diamond, and an airplane, from a very powerful Chinese Mafia boss. All with the help of Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) , a streetwise little Chinese boy (with a very irritating voice!) , surely based on Chang from the Tin Tin books. They land, seemingly by chance in a poverty-stricken Indian village, where all the children have been stolen away by a savage Thugee cult of Death. From there it is on to the Pankot Palace, before our friends descend into the pits of the hellish Temple of Doom, where they must rescue the poor enslaved children. Plenty of suspense and action, some quite gory scenes, comedy, and of course the romance between Indy and Willie, who really looked sexy in that outfit she was wearing when they came out of the mines. Not quite the masterpiece that Raiders of the Lost Ark was, but most of the time it was entertaining. Although the scene in the cocoa pans , in the pits, did really drag on , and what happened to that cute little Maharaja in the end? 
This one is often the least favorite of many but not for me. In fact Temple of Doom is in fact my favorite of the bunch. Indiana Jones is in 1930s Shanghai China and has been making a deal with a Chinese mafia leader but after an altercation, he escapes until things go wrong when the plane goes down in India and he ends up in a village where all of the children have been kidnapped. It turns out that they were taken to an underground diamond mine that is run by a Satanic Thuggee cult lead by Mola Ram. The cult worships the evil god Khali and Indie must rescue the children and retrieve the stones. This one is my favorite of them all. I like them all but TOD is the best of them. I love it's dark and sinister tone and the incredible action sequences especially towards the latter half. Some scenes were a bit troubling and even stereotypical but overall, Spielberg and Lucas hit the high mark on here. Go and buy this movie but get it on the DVD set immediately. 
The "Indiana Jones" trilogy will endure for a long time--everyone adores cliffhangers and romance, and these three films have plenty of both. Of the three, the middle film, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, is by far the ickiest: the assortment of bugs, monkey brains, millipedes, burning bodies, and unique open-heart surgeries are visually more stunning than tangles of snakes and melting Nazis. But, like the other two, TEMPLE OF DOOM is loaded with action, great pacing, and on-the-money performances. 
The opening is my favorite in all movies. My next favorite is the opening for Men In Black. I became a fan of Kate Capshaw when I saw her in this movie. She shows three times the personality of the female leads in Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. She made the movie a standout to me. I enjoy Short Round too. I believe that there is plenty of character development in this movie, and character development in a movie is extremely important to me. I honestly don't understand some other reviewer's complaints 
The third in Director Andrej Wadja's war trilogy, Ashes and Diamonds is set in Poland on the last day of WW2. The German High Command have issued their unconditional surrender and the Communists quickly fill the vacuum left by Hitler's goose-steppers and set up shop. Warsaw is lousy with rats and not all of them are of the rodent variety as power hungry bureaucrats jostle for position in the new order. Having spent the last half a decade under the Nazi junta; the prospect of a future under Stalin's jackboot is met with keen opposition. Maciek, a resistance fighter, is ordered to kill a local Socialist party official, which he is more than happy to do, but soon discovers he has killed two innocent civilians instead. Maciek books a room at a rundown hotel where his quarry is staying. While he waits for the right moment to make amends he meets and falls in love with the barmaid Krystyna. His connection to the girl leads him to rethink his part in the endless cycle of violence. The central role of Maciek was played by the brilliant Zybigniew Cybulski who came to be known as the `Polish James Dean.' Dean's death in a highway smash in 1955 meant he would never fulfil his promise and so would forever be frozen in movie goer's minds as a deeply troubled boy. Cybulski was 30 when he played the role that made him and gives us a glimpse of what his western counterpart could have achieved. Cybulski's Maciek is a worldly wise, vodka fuelled skirt chaser, (not a million miles away from his real life persona allegedly) and far from being made twisted and bitter by his war experiences, Cybulski plays the character as a man who laughs at the cruel joke of life that his been played on all of us and is determined to "have fun and not be swindled" even in the face of imminent annihilation. It was a conscious decision on Wadja and Cybulski's part that despite their story taking place in 1945, ASHES AND DIAMONDS' central character was going to be `all out' 50's cool. Parts Brando, Dean and Clift - Maciek, in his army fatigues and `sun-glasses after dark' became a symbol for Polish teenagers who would emulate his style for years to come; and his Anna Karenna-esque death beneath the wheels of a late night train in 1967 only exacerbated his legendary status. Even now we see shades of him in any number of Hong Kong `glock operas' and John Cusack's `assassin in Raybans' from Grosse Point Blank is a clearly a direct ancestor. Often charged with being overloaded with symbolism as scenes are obscured by upside down crucifixes; characters rendered almost invisible in morning light whilst unfurling flags or inexplicably joined by white horses as they ponder the possibilities of a brighter future, ASHES AND DIAMONDS makes no secret of its Expressionist credentials. The youthful hero dying on a mountainous rubbish dump to the accompaniment of screeching crows is an image lifted almost directly from Van Gogh's apocalyptic `Crows over Wheatfield's'. Two years after Cybulski met his destiny on the snowy platform of Wroclaw station Wadja made EVERYTHING FOR SALE about an actor missing from the set of a film. The missing actor was clearly meant to be Cybulski who even in death dominated every scene. It still stands as probably the best film an actor never made. 
*Spoilers ahead!* Ashes and Diamonds begins on the day when World War II ended for Poland. A day which brought with it celebration but also uncertainty. The war has ended and things are still viscous but like molten rock, this state is temporary. Enter the charismatic carefree Maciek and the serious Andrzej, two Polish exiles who joined the resistance in 1941 when they were fighting the Germans for a free Poland. With the war over, and the Russians invading their country, this was not the victory they imagined. And so they lay beside a country church basking in the sunlit clarity of a warm beautiful day, waiting for the arrival of a local communist party chairman, so they can fill him full of lead and then head for their next assignment. But things are not clear at all and in Maciek's obvious enthusiasm for his job, he executes two innocent men, though he will not learn of his error until later in the 24 hours period during which this film takes place. By that time the clear sky will turn dark with rain and Maciek's resolve to "finish" the job will be severely weakened by the beautiful barmaid, Krystyna, who awakens within him a dormant faith in humanity and the possibility of love and happiness. Ashes and Diamonds is a film that constantly paces back and forth between differing visions of a Post WWII Poland - not surprising since director Wajda had to walk a fine line between his fellow Poles and the Soviet censors. Most of the film takes place in darkness and the characters, like the film itself pace back and forth struggling with an existential anguish that is almost crushing. The enormous weight of responsibility when life becomes more than simply surviving. The decision to act or not to act - both have far reaching consequences. The films emotional core takes place during a masterfully shot scene in a hotel room with both Maciek and Krystnya emotionally and physically naked. Cinematographer Jerzy Wojcik, who graces this film with many unforgettable images, gives us still another and with muted lense dissolves one lovers face into another interchangeably to suggest a coming together of souls. Once carefully measured exteriors are being melted by buried emotion like the way lava changes the face of a mountain. "Don't touch me" remarks Krystnya during a particularly tender moment, but these words are said not as a threat but as a last gasp defensive measure. "I don't want any good-byes or memories to leave behind." Soon the two lovers will sneak out into the night, "God, life can be so beautiful sometimes." Says Maciek with enthusiasm just prior to a downpour that will have them scurring into the shelter of the burned out ash filed ruins of a church, with Jesus on a crucifix hanging upside down above the ruble. It is here that Krystnya reads an inscription from the Polish Poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid which will spur the dormant revolutionary within Maciek into action. From you, as from burning chips of resin Fiery fragments circle far and near: Ablaze, you don't know if you are to be free. Or if all that is yours will disappear. Will only ashes remain and confusion Whirling into the void? - Or will there shine Amidst the ash a starlight diamond, the dawning of eternal victory 
Definitvely the craft of Wajda shows us over and over he is a real master. In this case Wajda a demolishing picture in which the burocracy , it is merciless beaten through the eyes of an apparent , minor shy and anodyne employer who literally will defy the system with all the consequences . This is real gem and historical portrait of Poland in the sixties 
Zbigniew Cybulski brings to life the Polish resistance in post-WW2 Poland. Now under the rule of Soviet Russia, Poland becomes the object of Communist militarization and control. A young Polish freedom fighter, along with his compatriots, plot to cause upheavel in the new communist regime in the area. Excellent actors, plot and setting bring this film to life on the screen as one of the greatest "resistance" type films of all time. Filmed in Polish, a real treat to hear as well as see 
Any great art hinges upon how it is able to address the conflicts that a person goes through in one's lives. Ashes and Diamonds, tries to bring out the conflict of an individual trapped between whether the ends are more important than the means. He is a part of a revolutionary group assigned to assassinate a political figure, and before the assassination takes place, he has an affair with a bar girl. The affair and the events thereof makes him realise the futility of the violence and whether the revolution are able to achieve the ends that they are working towards. A brilliant film, the best by Wajda and it will continue to have a timelessness associated with it 
With Ashes and Diamonds, Andrzej Wajda completed his trilogy concerning the Polish experience during World War II. It is the last day of the war, and a young Republican resistance fighter, Maciek, has been assigned to assassinate a high ranking member of the Communist resistance. Maciek's experiences leading up to the killing--his contact with the kindly Communist leader, his romance with a young barmaid--seriously undermine his initial allegiance to the dying Republican cause. Director (and former resistance member) Wajda brilliantly portrays the fratricidal impulses guiding Poland immediately after the war--impulses which ultimately prostrated Poland under a Communist regime for decades. The directionlessness and confusion of postwar Poland is evident in Wajda's treatment and, although it is never directly seen, the Soviet Union's Red Army is unmistakably present. In its entirety, the trilogy of A Generation, Kanal, and Ashes and Diamonds devastatingly documents the death of Old Central Europe. However, it is a testament to Wajda's talent that Ashes and Diamonds can easily stand on its own 
This movie is a classic - a young(er) Nicholas Cage is fun to watch, as is the entire cast! One of my favorites to watch over and over!! 
I am a big of fan of Shirley McLaine and Nicholas Cage. The movie begins and ends with comedy and drama. Nicholas plays a frustrated Secret Service agent to guard a former first lady played by McLaine and she keeps him on the run. The movie is wonderful. I highly recommend it. 
A very pleasant surprise, Guarding Tess, brings to the screen the story of a secret service agent guarding the widow of a former president and all that that entails. Could he possibly be biting more than he can chew? Even though the American Founding Fathers would probably not be pleased with the way their successors have been abusing their powers and with the "royal" treatment that they have been receiving (a far cry from the original humility and anti-monarchist rhetoric), one cannot stand idle and not recognize the strong bond that developed between the former first lady and her protector. Nicolas Cage, Shirley MacLaine, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, Guarding Tess is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! 4 1/2 Stars 
doug [nicolas cage] is an fbi agent assigned to guard tess [shirley mclaine] a widowed, former first lady. he is a rules and regulations guy with no spontaniety, she is a free spirit with little tolerance for the fbi's button-down world. prior to being assigned to tess, doug worked under her husband, the president. one day while watching videotape of her husband's funeral, tess sees doug become emotional, a rare opportunity to see him vulnerable. it's obvious they have more in common than at first glance. doug is tested later and comes to realize he cares for her very much. great movie, with a lot of heart and humanity 
This is one of the greatest movies I have watched. I know I have probably watched the movie twenty times in the past. It has heart and compassion. It is absolutely one of the best I have see 
Guarding Tess is a pretty good comedy drama that becomes a fair suspense drama by the end. Nicolas Cage (Matchstick Men) plays a Secret Service agent in charge of guarding an obstinate former first lady, first widow Carlisle, played by Shirley MacLaine (The Sheepman). Cage wants out of the job to move on to a more important / exciting assignment, but MacLaine bends the ear of the current President to keep him. Arguments between the two are amusing and interesting as they each maneuver to get their own way. Cage insists on following rules to the letter to try to irritate her into releasing him - but she always seems to have more power. The supporting cast includes Edward Albert as Mrs. Carlisle's son, and Austen Pendleton as the driver who's with the first widow .. when ... she ..... disappears..... 
GUARDING TESS wouldn't be so much fun if it weren't for the presence of the unflappable Shirley MacLaine as the former first lady who gets Nicolas Cage for her secret service bodyguard. Cage is equally effective in his role. He hates his assignment and he and MacLaine don't get along well at all. But when the President himself (voiced by director Hugh Wilson) insists on their pairing, what can Cage do? Other than the expected pivotal kidnap plot, there's not a whole lot that goes on, but the film surprisingly shows what it must be like to surrender your privacy due to your notoriety and MacLaine's attempts to find such private moments is poignant. A solid supporting cast makes it work too, although Edward Albert's character of MacLaine's son is rushed over too much to bring any significance to the role. All in all, a pleasant enjoyable movie 
When "Guarding Tess" was released eight years ago, I ended up watching it in the theater because I was bored and because it looked a little more promising than the rest of the pack. That thought proved to be an understatement. To date, I have seen this movie at least eight times, and I tend to enjoy it more with each viewing. Nicholas Cage is perfect as the disgruntled Secret Service agent who feels he has been banished to his current duty -- namely, doting on a cantankerous former First Lady, played to the hilt by Shirley MacLaine. "Guarding Tess" is alternately funny and moving, and even includes a bit of a mystery for Cage to solve. Far more than a one-dimensional film, "Guarding Tess" is satisfying for so many reasons -- the witty script, the fine performances, the deft direction, and the mostly even pacing, to name a few. While you can catch this on a regular basis on TBS (which has made the movie one of its most reliable staples), "Guarding Tess" is definitely worth owning for more frequent viewing 
Reading reviews of the cavalry trilogy movies (Fort Apache, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande) you will possibly hear appreciation for the director, the actors, the locations, etc., but one thing you may not hear is appreciation for the author who put pen and ink to paper to write all these stories that found their way to the movie screen. His name was James Warner Bellah and from his short story, MASSACRE, published by Curtis Publishing Company in 1947 came the framework for the movie Fort Apache. Other of his stories form the background for the other 2 cavalry pictures, as well as the later movie, Sergeant Rutledge. All these stories, 10 in total, later appeared in a Fawcett Gold Medal paperback (s1218) entitiled REVEILLE which sold for 35 cents in June, 1962. The fort was called Fort Starke in the stories and this is how Fawcett summarized the book: "A choice collection of great stories that thunder the glory of the old horse soldiers in their final triumphant days at Fort Starke ... This is what it was like". I have two copies of that 1962 Fawcett Gold Medal paperback, as well as two copies of the June, 1960, .35 cent Bantam paperback western A2085: SERGEANT RUTLEDGE. As Paul Harvey would say: now you know the rest of the story. Semper Fi 
The 1st and best of the calvary trilogy. Fonda plays a small-minded, embittered, rascist, classist, dishonorable, incompentent, pendantic, martinet. Wayne, in a subordinant role, plays his loyal but wary second-in-command. From the very beginning, Ford's Col Thursday gets off on the wrong foot. Rude, unprofessional and openly disdainful, he alienates everyone on his new post, especially and, purhaps most importantly, the women. His ceaseless disrespect offends the wives and infuriates their husbands. Nobody likes to see their wife disrespected, particularly by a senior officer who should know better. Fort Apache is a wonderful examination of military mens' devotion to duty even when commanded by those unfit to command 
This is a great classic John Wayne movie. I am very happy it is on DVD no 
My second favourite John Wayne Movie, the first being "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon". A great cast and very entertaining as the westerns from this era are far superior to those of today. The movie shows just because you are superior in rank doesn't mean you know everything. The battle of wills between two of the greats John Wayne and Henry Fonda was handled beautifully by these two veteran actors. Throw in a great supporting cast of Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Shirley Temple, John Agar and you can't miss. I highly recommend this movie to add to your collection. Glad to see it finally came out on DVD. 
I have another review of this GREAT John Ford classic under the "John Wayne-John Ford Collection",which includes eight(8) classic Wayne-Ford motion Pictures that include:"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"(great Technicolor Western),"Stagecoach",(the film that made Wayne a Star and brought back the Western,along with DeMille's "Union Pacific",back to A-Level movie status)"They Were Expendable"(a WW2 film set in the Pacific,co-starring Wayne and Robert Montgomery)," 3 Godfathers"( Often filmed Western story that Ford made as a silent,starring Harry Carey,sr.,who this film is made in Memory of),"The Long Voyage Home"(nearly forgotten Ford masterpiece,derived from four (4) Eugene O'Neill playlets,adapted by Dudley Nichols),"The Wings of Eagles"(the true story of Frank "Spig" Wead,WW1-WW2 flying ace and real life pal of Ford,with Wayne-O'Hara as husband wife,with NOT ENOUGH MAUREEN!),and a special 2-disc DVD set of that great anti- racist post-Civil-War Western, "The Searchers". In "Fort Apache", Henry Fonda,as the new commander,of Fort Apache, is an arrogant Indian hating, and Irish-Catholic disliking,WASP who seeks glory for himself,no matter what the cost maybe!Great perfomances by Fonda, Wayne,George O'Brien,Ward Bond,Anna Lee,Irene Rich,Victor McLaglen,Dick Foran(who sings very well too),Grant Withers(as a corrupt Suttler),Guy Kibbe, Pedro Armendariz,and as a very sympathetic "Cochise" Miguel Inclan!Shirley temple and John Agar provide the love interest.A GREAT MOVIE! A GREAT WESTERN!! by AMERICA'S GREATEST DIRECTOR!! 
Back in my Army days ("When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth") it was a common belief among many, if not most, of us laboring for the cause in green fatigues, that every "shavetail" 2nd lieutenant who ever put a pair of gold bars on his shoulders or an "L.T." clip on his collar, should be required to watch John Ford's "Fort Apache" before he drew his first duty assignment...and should be also required to write an essay on what it meant. Same thing, we all consensed, should apply to every officer being promoted to a higher rank, right on up the scale. The reason for this, we felt, was that everyone "moving up" needed to always be reminded that "The Book" (i.e. military regs, tactics, etc.) was only truly workable as a GENERAL GUIDE and was not a foolproof blueprint for micro-managing warfare (or LIFE) on a day by day basis. All too often, obsessively going "by the book"...and ignoring all contrary circumstances around you...will land you in a "heap o' trouble". And this by-the-book (or "Company S.O.P.") "mania" is a nuisance factor that often bedevils people to this very day in all walks of life---from hospital staffs to office staffs to restaurant workers to all manner of others---where "the book" both intervenes and interferes with a practical "real world" effort at "getting the job done". All to often 'the book" is compiled by "executive" types who have nothing better to do than sit around and make up silly, unrealistic, and impractical rules and regulations (most of them...with regard to consequential "spill-over effects"...not very well thought out at all) that OTHER people have to TRY and make workable. "Fort Apache" tells the story of a "Book Soldier", Henry Fonda's "Col. Owen Thursday", a by-the-numbers martinet who has come to the Arizona frontier with his head full of Von Clausewitz, Sun Tsu, Alexander and Bonaparte , and West Point concepts of "pinchers" and "envelopments". He is an arrogant elitist who views American Indians as crude, unsophisticated savages and who eyes their capabilities as fighting men with scorn and dismissive disregard. John Wayne plays "Captain Kirby York", Fort Apache's executive officer behind Fonda, and the leader of a cadre of veteran officers and NCOs who KNOW the territory and KNOW their adversaries, the Apaches....know them WELL ENOUGH, in fact, to RESPECT them. AND to account for their strengths and capabilities in dealing with them. All this knowledge and "feel" for the Apaches means nothing to Thursday when he comes swaggering in, and he takes no time in letting everyone know everything will henceforth be done HIS way. The garrison is troubled and uneasy about "His" way, but they have no option but to follow his lead. He IS the colonel. York tries to reason with Thursday but gets nowhere. He even gets used most egregiously (and dishonorably) by Thursday in luring the legendary Cochise over the border from Mexico into U.S. territory. There seems to be no ploy the arrogant colonel won't use in his quest for promotion and prestige within the army. Thursday gets HIS comeuppence in the end...but, unfortunately, he makes a lot of other GOOD men pay the ultimate price for his own incompetence and ineptitude along with him. In many ways the Thursday character is a bit of a take-off on George Custer, although Thursday's demise is based more on the Fetterman Massacre of 1866 rather than on Little Big Horn. Ford's direction is sure-handed in this, and the performances of John Wayne and Henry Fonda are superb. The black white cinematography is excellent and the jaunty use of 19th century cavalry music...particularly "The Girl I Left Behind Me"...is enough to get one's head nodding and toes tapping whenever the band stikes up. "Fort Apache" may be, overall, the best of the famous "Cavalry Trilogy" , with "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon" coming in a VERY close second behind it. "Rio Grande" is not a klunker, either, by a long shot...but doesn't really have the sheer power of the first two. And the only reason this trilogy is not a "Quartet" is that "The Horse Soldiers" is a "Southern", rather than a "western", and no Indians are involved in it.(And, note: if you like this rip-roaring cavalry stuff, you also need to check out Errol Flynn's "They Died With Their Boots On" and "Santa Fe Trail"). "Fort Apache" should have been DVD-available much earlier than now, but it IS here at last, so lets all enjoy this marvelous piece of Americana 
John Ford must have felt very fortunate (although he would have never have admitted it)to have had John Wayne and Henry Fonda star in Fort Apache. Wayne and Fonda were by far the great director's favorite leading men - he made Wayne a star in "Stagecoach," and went on to direct him in some of the best-loved, best remembered Westerns ever, "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon," "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance," and one of the greatest movies of any genre, "The Searchers." Fonda appeared in many movies with Ford as well, including "Drums Along The Mohawk," "The Grapes of Wrath," and another immortal Western, "My Darling Clementine." Following a pattern that he would continue in "Liberty Valance," Ford analyzes the mythology of the West, in particular the valiant heroic cavalry officer who bravely and unavoidably leads his men to certain death, thereby obtaining immortal glory. Fonda plays an arrogant, by-the-book stiff commander who will have nothing less than a to-the-death struggle with Cochise. Wayne is his subordinate, trying desperately to avoid catasrophe. This film has it all, great performances, great direction, and great cinematography. It is way past time that this great film be released on DVD, but it is well worth the wait 
DVD newcomer "Fort Apache" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio. The film, ironically, finds Henry Fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against John Wayne's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice. The (single) DVD has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film, a shame. It does include a 15-minute piece on Monument Valley, covering Ford's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the Indian reservation's history. The Navajo, paid good wages for their appearances, called him "Giant Soldier." "I've kissed more babies than a politician," Ford said. "Part of his vision of the world was that we're all very small in the scheme of things," film historian Joseph McBride says. "I think (Monument Valley) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along." [... 
This is the gem of the Wayne/Ford Calvary trilogy, and I am delighted it's finally coming to DVD. But a question: Can anyone heal me of the following misjudgment? Try as I may, I cannot shake off my estimation of Fort Apache as a more complete and substantially higher overall cinematic accomplishment in comparison with The Searchers. Partly it may consist in the fact that The Searchers is a great movie to watch -- and watch again -- but Fort Apache somehow succeeds as a more nearly perfect, complete and wholly rounded experience. The Searchers shines due to its externals, but Apache proceeds and then later culminates in a richer, deeper and more satisfying way, and the whole movie experience resonates with you in a way that The Searchers does not quite achieve 
Richard Donner's "Maverick" probably deserves ample recognition as among the funniest westerns ever made since Mel Brooks's "Blazin' Saddles". Based on the atypical 1960s television western starring James Garner, Mel Gibson does a great job taking over from Garner as the suave, debonair gambler Brett Maverick, en route to the World Series of Poker in Saint Louis, Missouri. He joins forces with a younger, ambitious gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), who is as sly as a fox, older U. S. marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) and a sympathetic Indian pal (Graham Greene). Both Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster are hysterically funny, giving us two of their finest portrayals in their long cinematic careers. Along the way they have to contend with a devious gambler (Alfred Molina) and a whole colorful assortment of other ill-mannered Wild West bad guys (Many of these are portrayed by some legendary actors from the great Hollywood westerns, like James Coburn and Denver Pyle.). Donner does a fine job directing his cast, which apparently had a lot of fun making this film since the chemistry amongst Gibson, Foster and Garner is absolutely superb 
From the director of "Lethal Weapon" and "Superman" and it shows. Really enjoyed this film. Spectacular shots of the West - shot in Yosemite. Mel Gibson is looking old - like early 40s - but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something. He's too comic here, as he has been of late. I much preferred him in "Mrs. Soffell" and "Hamlet". And James Garner was perfect - all cool to Gibson's manic energy. And tons and tons of cameos, from Danny Glover, to Doug McClure, to Robert Fuller. But Gibson was not as smooth as Garner in the original "Maverick", nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself. The movie was entertaining but gimmicky, from the borrowings from "Lethal Weapon" and "Raiders" to Graham Greene's wisecracking Indian. It was just a little too precious. Gibson should go back to serious stuff. (And look what he does now!) I must admit the ending caught me. I had not a clue. But as a fun movie, it definitely works. James Coburn must be mentioned. He looked great, sounded great, was great. How old is he anyway? Mel Gibson should age so well. And a beautiful old steamboat. Plot was all about poker and money, what else 
This is an excellent movie. I bought it for my husband, but I have to admit I truly enjoy it too. This is one of the best comedic westerns around! It has a great plot that keeps you guessing right up until the end! 
This is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about. It is about laughs. It is a comedy that takes place in the old west. Mel Gibson plays a professional gambler, Brett Maverick, who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament. The entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars. He has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him, always with hilarious results. As he makes his way towards to tournament, he encounters another gambler, played by Jodie Foster, who also wants to enter the tournament. She too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket. The final main character is the US Marshall played by James Garner. He does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well. He has been hired to provide security. As they make their way to the big event, all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others. The Indians get involved and come across as the funniest, most honest and most intelligent people around. They finally get Maverick his stake (with lots of laughs) and the stage is set for the big tournament. The tournament itself is full of laughs, surprises, twists and turns. It also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars. All of this is fun but the interplay between Gibson, Foster and Garner is the real fun. Get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing. 
A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy... When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails). Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford. As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant. But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge... Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try... The DVD Repor 
With a renewed interest of the "Western" genre in 80's 90's(YOUNG GUNS, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN) and classic tv series being made into films,MAVERICK was a natural. To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying "I'm getting too old for this ----!") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western. Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride. James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it. The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc. Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy "Angel", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out. Lastly, veteran James Garner is good in everything he does. The closing scenes with Garner Gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying. Overall, fun, light, entertaining and perfect 
A great movie! What an all star cast! This movie is worth watching over and over again 
PICTURE QUALITY = 4-SOUND QUALITY = 5+The overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying. Color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie. Improves as movie goes on. This being a very senic movie I was not completly happy but still satisfied. Could've been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but wasnt.The sound quality in Dolby was awesome. Not in Dolby Digital but on a system with Pro Logic II it souded great if not better than most non-digital dolby surround. All surround sounds are present and really stood out. The soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room. Very happpy with this DVD sound quality.THE MOVIE - *note spolier. The movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a FUN Western movie. Comedy, action, stunts, scenery, and many great actors. Everything you would want in a "fun" western film in the old fashioned tradition. Light on violence and good enough for the whole family.*Spoiler - The best (and my favorite) thing about this movie is the fact that James Garner still plays as Maverick even though the audience doesn't know it. Watching it over and knowing that Mel Gibson is playing his role as "the son of Maverick" and James Garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and over.My overall review is that it is worth buying and I'd give it 5 stars if the picture was just a touch better. Don't be fooled though, I have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component DVD player so I see almost any grain there is if any is present. Overall this DVD was satisfying enough to make me happy I bought it. On any other tv it will display a perfect picture. Sound quality is great on a home theatre sound system.This is a movie that should be made on a Superbit DVD 
I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible. My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end. On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films. Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie 
Of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, "Best in Show" is definitely the best. The characters and story gel in a perfect comic concoction. "Best in Show" is very different than "Waiting for Guffman" (the first film in the Guest trilogy), although it brings back many of the same actors. While Guffman has a cruel streak in it, "Best in Show" is a little kinder to the characters it skewers -- without losing the laughs. I would skip the third film in the trilogy (A Mighty Wind) unless you are looking for a bittersweet drama. It's just not that funny. If you are Jonesing for a mockumentary fix, search for "G-Sale" -- a quirky comedy very much in the Christopher Guest vein. It got a lot of great reviews and was even labeled "the movie Christopher Guest should have made instead of A Mighty Wind. 
This movie is a scream! I laughed until I thought I was going to die. Comedy doesn't get any better than this. The characters are incredible. It's amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie! Do yourself a favor and watch this movie! It's even better the second time around 
I was not privy to the world of Christopher Guest until a friend of mine told me that if I liked `Drop Dead Gorgeous' then I would flip over any of Guest's films. The video store only had one in, and that was `Best in Show' and I'm SOOOOO glad they had it. This film has to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen, a complete riot from beginning to end. As a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the Mayflower Dog Show. The film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy. There's Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Crenshaw play Leslie and Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (total spoof on the whole Anna Nicole Smith scandal), owners of a prize winning poodle who's won `Best in Show' 2 years straight, and with the help of lesbian handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) hopefully she'll win for a third. Then there's Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist. And there's power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers. There are lovers Stefan Scott (Michael McKean John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu's and each other. But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' Weimaraner who's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex. Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance. The film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken WAY TO SERIOUS, and with Fred Willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish 
This is one of the most underrated comedies of all-time 
"Best in Show" is another of the very funny improvisational dialog movies that Christopher Guest has directed. The situations are scripted by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, but after that they simply let the actors go where they will with the characters and keep the cameras running. In this movie, he takes aim at dog shows, and the results speak for themselves. The plot of this film is very simple, as the audience is following 5 dogs and their owners and trainers as the go to compete in the Mayflower Dog Show. Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins are hilarious as Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan, the gay owners of Miss Agnes (a Shih Tzu), and Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are equally funny as the preppy "win at all cost" owners (Meg and Hamilton Swan) of Beatrice (a Weimaraner). Christopher Guest plays Harlan Pepper, the outdoorsman owner of Hubert (a Bloodhound), Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are the mismatched couple (Cookie and Gerry Fleck) who own Winky (a Norwich Terrier) where Gerry is a geek, and Cookie seems to have ex-lovers all over the country. Last, but not least, we have Jennifer Coolidge who plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot the rich owner of the two-time reigning champion Rhapsody in White (a Poodle), and Jane Lynch who plays Christy Cummings the trainer. The other key members of the cast are Fred Willard, who plays Buck Laughlin the know-nothing TV announcer, and Jim Piddock who is Trevor Beckwith, the knowledgeable color man and who plays the straight man for Willard's antics. There are also some wonderful smaller roles, such as Larry Miler as one of Cookie's ex-lovers and Ed Begley Jr. as the hotel manager. Those are just some of the names, but I can't do justice to their wonderful work in such a short review. The actors are the key to improvisation, and the audience is in good hands with this movie. The situations are funny, but the performances are even funnier. "Best in Show" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8th, 2000. It was not nominated for any Academy Awards, but it did win three American Comedy Awards including: Funniest Motion Picture, Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (Fred Willard), Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Catherine O'Hara), and Christopher Guest was also nominated for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. The film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the American Cinema Editors, Boston Society of Film Critics, British Comedy Awards, Canadian Comedy Awards, the Golden Globes and many more. This DVD includes an audio commentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy which is somewhat low-key, but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention. Also available are quite a few deleted scenes. You will also find the features which are almost standard at this point, such as a trailer and cast/filmmaker profiles. In my opinion, this is the best of the improvisational films after "This is Spinal Tap". 
Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud. Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few. The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event. Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru. Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch). Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills. Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins). Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of. There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount. Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr. Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners. But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, "they all jump." BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. With star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time, this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish 
Certainly one of the funniest films ever. Great acting and directing. Especially suitable for dog owners, but not limited to them. 
There is a lot of traffic in Rome. Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains. Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't. There are many American tourists in Rome, especially around the fountains in the piazzas, where they cluster and sing American songs. Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances. "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma". Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night. But Rome is not what it used to be. Everybody knew each other and was polite, while now everybody is rushed and rude. Besides, the free love of today has substituted the brothels of yesterday. Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so. Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact, bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical performance. The public then proceeded to the shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue. The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court. They run parties together, even fashion shows. Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope how to rule the Church. And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence. One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time. Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the standard collection of stereotypes about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide? It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes. And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.  That is perhaps also a scene worth watching. But the rest is commercial cinema. "Vai a dormi', Federico". 
Fellinis's Roma is the director's fanciful excursion into auto-biographical self-indulgence on a magical higher level. Filmed after his psychedelic "Satyricon", Fellini extends his series of dream-inspired visual classics. Make no mistake, at age 50, Fellini still had it. "Fellini Roma" is a plotless, visceral delight. It is perfect. From scenes of the Rome subway to Musolini's Fascist dynasty, "Fellinis Roma" encompases scenes from the director's life in 1931 up until the hippie onslaught around 1972. It doesn't make sense. It isn't supposed to. It's great art. It's eye candy. I'm going to put on the DVD again 
You must be a true F. Fellini fan to enjoy this one. It is not as abstract as his other works, but a good documentary type movie through the eyes of one of Italy's greatest directors 
Federico Fellini's 1972 film is not his best, when he has 8 1/2, La Strada and La Dolce Vita to his credit. While many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless, dreamy structure, I found it boring and phantasmagorical. It is simply Fellini's version of Rome and not Rome, the Eternal City itself. To risk sounding negative, I shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970's Rome - the scenes in which the hippies and American tourists invade the city, the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off (though saying some pretty vulgar things) and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old Roman Patricians fade into oblivion. But mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot. It starts off alright, and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences. Fellini is himself in this movie, as well as Gore Vidal. Fellini envisions himself as a young man studying Rome in his youth in a strict Catholic school (the slide/projector shows ancient monuments like the Colliseum, the Apian Way, Trevi Fountain and Vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman's behind) and later as a young man journeys to Rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum. Then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless, vulgar and long-winded. I found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage! It bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution, brothels or cheap, slutty women. The cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film. And for a film about Rome and Italy, there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater. The Pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous. Only serious, hardcore fans of Fellini will want to own this DVD. It is a perfect follow-up to his equally absurd and sexually radical Satyricon, loosely based on the old Roman epic. 
Originally made for TV, Roma is a classic in the later Fellini style. Interspersed with typically hilarious autobiographical remembrances of the city, the maestro captures the incongruity of modern Italian society's imposition upon the historic significance (both ancient and 20th century wartime) of Rome. Worth catching is the cameo of the iconoclastic young Gore Vidal near the conclusion of the film 
Fellini paid his personal tribute to Roma , and he memorialized himself for the first time ; this is simply one the most ravishing films in any age , filled with bitter humor and incisive insights . Fede built the movie as a set of delightful vignettes , making a great journey around the great city . From the initial sequence in which we are in the middle of a hell traffic to the warm rendition of that admirable and unforgettable Anna Magnani the greatest actress of the italian cinema ever , but when you watch the recreation of the WW2 music hall and the unforgettable parade in the Vatican for priest and nuns you will be absolutely sure that no other filmmaker (with the supreme exception of Luis Buuel) has been able to state a freedom state with barroque and dazzling images and sardonic approach as FeFe. 
Would "Caligula" or "Nero" be shocked at what their city, the Eternal City, has become so many years into the distant future? Or would they (probably more likely) find themselves fitting right in somehow? This is one of the notions that I found myself pondering as I watched this movie. It really is a great movie, and it is certainly worth any true film fan's time. I may have even liked (some of it at least) better than (again, some of) La Dolce Vita.  Having grown up in an Italian family - my father was born in a "pagliarone" ( roughly, slang dialect term meaning "stone hut") in an ancient and very rural village in Molise - I myself was definitely right at home , so to speak, watching scenes like the famous "dinner on the piazza". (Personally I could watch that scene again and again and not get tired of it, but...maybe it is "an Italian thing", so to speak, and others would not find it so amusing). However there certainly is no dearth of general humour to be found in the antics of the wild cast of characters which Fellini always brings into his films. And Roma of course is no exception to this. For example the bedridden obese old woman in a hairnet, who owns the building that he stays in in Rome when he first arrives in Rome, who tells him, "now let's just live in peace and not bust each other's balls"! Or the bald old man who does a rather convincing Mussolini impersonation. My personal favorite though would probably be the ultra-tanned "Continental" type of guy who approaches the female American tourist the second she gets off the bus, telling her, "You VERY bella" and offering to take her picture for her. Or the young man in the piazza scene (which is supposed to have taken place some thirty years prior) who is wearing a gold medallion and one of those black nylon "do-rags" (the kind that rap stars wear today), yelling up to his dark beautiful brooding girlfriend to get down to the piazza before he throws her off the balcony. Sure these are walking stereotypes, these characters, and negative ones at that. But, as they say, there is a kernel of truth (at least) in all stereotypes is there not? For instance the entire "dinner on the piazza" scene, any Italian or Italian-American must admit, does definitely resemble some sort of "prototypical" pre-emigration summer-night-in-Bensonhurst or some place like that, with plenty of gold chains, "dago-t's", and "pane e vino" to go around.  On a more serious note however the most touching scene (and this is a point that is usually generally agreed upon I think by most of the movie's fans) is the scene of the sudden (and apparently accidental) destruction of the ancient Roman frescoes by the modern work-crew. Obviously this is Fellini's artistic condemnation , if you will, of the massive industrialization of the City in modern times, and the (clearly potentially disastrous) effects of what we may call the "godless modern" encountering the ancient and sacred. Cruel and loud machinery encountering the long-buried, the "resting-in-peace", the "sacred". Such imagery, like Fellini's vision of the vanishing ancient frescoes, is so evocative it can truly make the viewer want to weep.  Athough Rome has improved much since Fellini filmed it back in 1972, in this film, during both of the time periods that he shows it to us, the City appears to have been delusional. Vaguely delirious with fever perhaps. Or in the throes of a long restless night full of tossings-and-turnings and wild "half-waking" dreams. And it is these dreams that in fact constitute the "images" and "vignettes" that Fellini shows to us throughout the film.    
Boy, it's astounding how many "11-year old viewers" on Amazon are so surprisingly literate and exacting in writing reviews. You'd think that maybe it was just an adult trying to pass themselves off for whatever reason, but no, certainly, it couldn't be that. Besides, we all know how much concern the average pre-teen has for accurate portrayals of historical figures in film 
This is an interesting film with Clint playing a cat burglar who likes to paint as a hobby. He is estranged from his daughter due to his criminal actiity but longs to be involved in her life. Clint plays this part with dignity and grace. The story is well written and interestingly filmed. It was nice to see Gene Hackman as part of the supporting cast. 
Absolute Power is not among Clint Eastwood greatest films, but it's much better than is usually given credit for. A dark thriller, directed as professionally and bleakly as only Eastwood can do it, Absolute Power centers around Luther Whitney, a professional burglar (Eastwood himself, in one of his best performances in the last decade), who finds himself in a classic wrong place, wrong time situation - while robbing a luxurious mansion, he accidentally witnesses a sexual assault and a murder, and the subsequent cover-up, that involves the President of the United States and the White House staff. That scene at the very beginning of the movie is probably the strongest one in it, Eastwood making brilliant use of cinematography, music (and especially the lack of) and his trademark heavy contrasted lighting, and with almost no dialogue at all, it's a remarkably effective scene that overshadows much of the rest of the film. Still, as the film turns into a more standard conspiracy-thriller, it holds its own quite well, mainly due to William Goldman's wonderful script (as his always are, this is the genius who wrote 'The Princess Bride', 'Marathon Man', 'Misery' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', among others) and most of all thanks to the absolutely fantastic all-star cast; other than Clint himself, who is ideal as the charming, ruthless but honest criminal, fantastic performances are also given by Gene Hackman as the President and by Ed Harris as the detective on the case. The rest of the excellent cast includes Laura Linney ('Primal Fear') as Luther's daughter; the fantastic Judy Davis ('Naked Lunch', 'Barton Fink') as the President's sneaky assistant; Scott Glenn ('Buffalo Soldiers'); Dennis Haysbert ('Far From Heaven'); E.G. Marshall ('Tora! Tora! Tora!'); Penny Johnson ('24'); and Richard Jenkins ('Six Feet Under'). As is usually the case with Clint Eastwood's films, all the actors seem to have been hand-picked by him directly, rather than participated in an audition, because each character seems to have been designed specifically for the actor portraying them. Because of that cast and the brilliant directing and dialogue, Absolute Power is an entirely gripping watch, even if the story is at times less than entirely convincing and just a little fragmented. Absolute Power tries to make its mark on three levels - the thriller level is the only one where it completely succeeds, and it manages to be constantly exciting, gripping and enticing. It works slightly less well on the human level, because the inter-character relationships are rather poorly developed. Laura Linney's character in particular is underdeveloped, and so the father-daughter relationship element hardly carries any weight in the story, and neither does her relationship with Ed Harris's character. As there is no interaction between Eastwood's character and Hackman's, the only relationships that are worth mentioning are the ones between Eastwood and Harris, which is strictly superficial and based on mutual respect, and the one between Hackman and Marshall, who plays the old billionaire who funded Hackman's rise to the presidency. The third level on which the film works is as political commentary; there it achieves partial success, as the story often seems contrived (although, one might note, not as contrived as we may imagine). Still, it can give you a general idea of how absolute power corrupts, and of the kind of horrors that the intricate systems of democracy might hide; but it's not to be taken too literally. The strongest elements of the story are the mystery, and Clint Eastwood's character, clearly the strongest in the film; as such it's a solid and enticing thriller with lots of atmosphere and wonderful acting, that will keep you glued to your seat 
Warning: this review reveals many things about the book but nothing about the movie. I don't know how they could say that this movie is based on the book. The only thing that is really the same is the burglary in the beginning. I know how movies based on books how to cut out many parts to make it fit until the right amount of time but i never thought that they could take out the main charactor and hero. Jack Graham was the best part of the book and Clint Eastwood cut him out to make himself the main charactor. Also they made the billionare Walter Sulivan seem like a complete idiot because Luther had to tell him who killed his wife. Sulivan was a very smart man and figured it out by himself. This movie cut out many important factors of the book that made it more suspenseful. Deaths like: Walter Sulivan, Luther Whitney, Sandy Lord, Sandy Lord's mistress, and Bill Burton. I am suprised that they even killed Christy Sulivan in the first place. Also they left out many key elements of the book such as: Jack for a big one, Russell and Collin's affair, the knife being destroyed, everyones death that I mentioned before, and Kate's relationship with her father. This movie pissed me off very much becuase it left out all of the suspence that Baldacci put in. I mean when Luther kills Collin it sounds like something straight out of Dirty Hairy "Mercy," said Collin "I fresh out," replied Luther. I mean come it's cool for an action movie with no plot but this book is one of my favorites and the movie ruined my mental image of it. Don't see the movie but I recommend the book 
When I first saw this movie I wasn't expecting anything great. I thought it was just going to be another 'corruption-in-the White-house-plot' but it turned out to be rather different. At the time such films were popular thanks to the Lewinskigate scandal. Absolute Power is much better than other films in the sub-genre like Murder at 1600. The plot and subject matter are handled with care and maturity and the direction was dignifying to the source material despite having some radical changes near the end. This was the second film I saw that Eastwood had directed (after Perfect World) and I was surprised to see that he is as good at directing as he is acting. Every scene is masterfully edited and framed. Even with a 121 minute running time the film doesn't drag at any point. I was most impressed with the opening of the movie. Despite the fact that Clint in on screen for the entire first 35 minutes he only has two short lines. I wonder why he didn't cut these out and say nothing until after the opening act as a way of giving the film a peculiar edge. Still, Absolute Power has an opening that has more class and masterful storytelling than most entire movies. There are three other main actors in the movie. Gene Hackman as the conniving President, Laura Linney as Eastwood's estranged daughter and Ed Harris as the investigating cop. Despite the scope of the film I thought it was brilliant how Eastwood kept the entire story between a handful of characters. Absolute Power focuses more on these characters and their motivations and feelings rather than giving us ridiculous reasons for set-pieces and shoot-outs. But the movie still has action and it is very well done indeed. I recommend you see this movie but try to see it in widescreen to fully appreciate Eastwood's great cinematography. The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Sadly, there are no extras 
It seemed that the last few films of Clint were slipping overall. But this one is not one of them. I really enjoyed this one as it was well thought out and well performed. Bravo to all hands involved! 
This movie was awful. That's all I can say about it. It killed the book, which happens to be one of my favorites. When I got this movie after reading the book, I excitedly stuck it in my VCR (yes, VCR-- no affordable DVD Players at the time), I was expecting so much more than what I received. I know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into 2-hours, but I've never before seen a movie cut out the main hero! Now, that's just ridiculous! If I were the author, David Baldacci, I would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered. Clint Eastwood had to be the star, so he twisted the whole plot around to make Luther Whitney the hero, when in the book Luther Whitney is gunned down half-way though. In the movie, the book's hero Jack Graham is totally non-existent. My advice to you if you're looking to buy a good movie: look someplace else. Read the book. *sigh* If only the movie would've followed the book a little more closely... It might have been a blockbuster hit. Too bad. 
This movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, written by William Goldman and stars Eastwood and Gene Hackman. So one expects to be kept entertained and one is. The plot is not dissimilar to `Murder at 1600' released the same year but this movie is a bit less preposterous if still a bit incredible. Eastwood is Luther Whitney, a likeable old housebreaker who is robbing a posh big house when he is interrupted. Hiding in a closet he witnesses a murder in which the Secret Service shoot dead a woman trying to defend herself against being raped by the US President no less. Though Whitney is obviously not the most honest man alive he's keen to blow the whistle but how? Surely nobody will believe him against the President and the Secret Service who are soon hard at work trying to wipe him out. This is very watchable, well-made thriller much as was Eastwood's `In the Line of Fire' a few years earlier. The suspense is nicely done and the acting generally pretty good. It's nothing very deep, just a popcorn movie - sadly nowhere near scaling the heights Eastwood reached with 'Unforgiven' - but a pretty decent effort. Its biggest flaw on the credibility front is probably that highlighted when Whitney is interviewed by Ed Harris's cop who thinks he is the burglar if possibly not the killer. 'I'm way too old for that sort of thing' is the line Whitney tries to sell him to avert suspicion and, for the audience, it's maybe hard to avoid the thought that, Yes, Clint, old fellow, maybe you are... 
Martin Lawrence is one crazy man. Anything he is or will be in is worth watching 
I hadn't seen this movie in 10 years until this past weekend when it resurfaced on TV -- whew!!! what a welcomed blast from the past. Martin Lawrence was still in his heyday as a comedian in this movie's 1996 release. A sober Bobby Brown delivers an entertaining performance as Martin's pseudo sidekick, Regina King plays a believable "it girl" role and Lynn Whitfield totally delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as a woman scorned and determined to make her man pay for all the heartache that comes from lies and deception. This is one of those twist-of-fate movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to "get some" and move on. The story is easy to follow. There's tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes. The movie moves along at a great pace -- you won't go to sleep on this! For anyone -- male or female -- who's ever had an "adventure in dating" with a nut you later question why you ever dated, this movie's for you. As the movie's theme song says, "The sweetest woman in the world could (also) be the meanest woman in the world/Did you make her that way?" You're just gonna have to watch this movie to "get it. 
"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate" stars Martin Lawrence, Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown and Della Reese. This is easily one of my favorite movies; I often watch it when I'm feeling depressed because it eases my mood and reminds me that even though we may face hard times, someone is always going through something worse than you. The movie is a about a player (womanizer) named Darnell who is confident that he can get any woman he wants. He was able to get women easily, because he was charming and co-owner of a hot club in town, so he was looking for a challenge. He found that challenge in Brandy Webb. Brandy is not your average female. She is high maintenance and rich. She does not deal with men like Darnell, for they are mid-class players. Darnell wants Brandy badly and goes through a lot to get her. While he is chasing Brandy, though, his old flame Mia is back in town from the Army. Darnell still has feelings for, but mind you, he is still chasing Brandy, and Mia is dating a well to do man. Darnell finally is able to get a date with Brandy, and after spending lots of time with her, he accomplishes his goal and "hits it". After he hits it, he loses interest in Brandy and pursues Mia. However, Brandy is not going to let Darnell go that easily. She does all she can to get revenge on Darnell. The whole while Darnell's mother is warning him about playing women, but he always brushes her off. In the end, Darnell CERTAINLY learns a lesson. I absolutely love this movie. The comedic performance is wonderful. I love the plot. I have never seen a black movie with this type of plot, so it was different. Martin Lawrence showed innovation in creating this movie. It is also neat that he named this movie after the song entitled "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate". The song and movie are about the same subject: "The sweetest woman in the world can be the meanest woman in the world, if you make her that way". This is a line from the song. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some drama. 
A cross between Lawrence humor and Hitchcock suspence. Martin plays the "playa" and uses his comedic style to provide the humor. This time there is less of the absurbed humor than in some of his previous movies. The Hithcock suspense is Lynne Whitfield's character. How many ways will she make the man pay and in the end to what degree does the playa learn his lesson. For the Martin Lawrence fan there is no disappointment. Maybe his best to date 
I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS PRETTY GOOD . THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT LYNN WHITFIELD HAVING A FATAL ATTRACTION FOR MARTIN LAWRENCE I LIKED IT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. BOBBY BROWN CO-STARRED IN THIS MOVIE ALONGSIDE MARTIN LAWRENCE I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT CONTAINS, DRAMA, ACTION,AND SUSPENSE ALSO, LYNN DID A ATERIFFIC ACTING JOB SHE PLAYED HER ROLE VERY WELL. FIVE THUMBS WAY UP!!!!! 
This is funny. Martin Lawrence is hilarious. I loved when his car windows were broken in front of the police station. How funny 
I thought this movie was a mix of Boomerang and Fatal Attraction. It had a nice cast (Martin Lawerence, Lynn Whitfield, Bobby Brown (small role, but he did his thing), Regina King). Ladies man gets caught up when he plays the wrong woman, and becomes a victim of her revenge. The movie is not super great, but it was a fun movie. There are parts that will make you laugh 
Our one year old loves this one, and so do I. The music is wonderful. The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational. The children, little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child. We watch this one most of all the Baby Einstein's that we have. 
When I found out I was expecting I knew I wanted to start a Baby Einstein collection. I had never seen the DVD's and didn't know what they were about at all, but when I was younger I worked at Toys R Us and parents were raving about them. When I went to buy one I didn''t even look at the ages, and happened to pick up Baby Monet which is 6 mos. and up. My son was only 3 mos. at the time and LOVED it!! The puppet shows that I found amusing (Spring and Summer), he did too. That amazed me. By the 50th showing he was cracking up at them. I am not sure if the age group is wrong or if it is because I started him on it early, but he seems to be bored with it now. He has moved on to On The Go, which he loves just the same and it is for ages 1+. He is 5 mos. On a side note, I searched high and low for the zebra puppets in this DVD, found it, paid $14 for it because he loved them soo much, and he will have nothing to do with it. Even when I make a fool of myself and try to imitate the sounds they make 
We have twins that just turned 1 on 3/06. They love this DVD and it gives me time to do a little cleaning, eating, or reading. And at the end when the dancing begins, our twins join in bouncing and laughing 
This is my personal favorite of the Baby Einstein DVD's! The puppets are cute and extremely entertaining. Personally, I think there are plenty of Monet paintings. They've done a great job with balance in this title, between the paintings, scenery and puppet shows. This DVD caught my daughters attention since she was 5 months old. She's now 8 months and still LOVES it. She'll laugh with the puppets and relax with the gorgeous scenery showcasing all the seasons. A definite MUST HAVE of the Baby Einstein collection 
My son loves this movie, its his favorite of the Baby Einstein's we have (we also have Baby Noah and On the Go). He watches it all the time. I definetly reccomend getting this one 
My two and three year olds have almost all the Baby Einstein DVD and this is one of their favorite. They beg to watch it and laugh out loud at the puppets. As usual, I am happy with the classical music, art work, and learning elements 
Yes, the commercials are crass, but once you get past that this DVD is one of the best especially for older infants. I started showing my son Baby Bach and Baby Mozart around 3 months (along with a few others, but I think those two are thest best for young infants.) Around 4 months I wanted to introduce my son to a little more mature viewing. Monet is recommended for 6 months and above, and it was around 5 months that this became his absolute favorite. At 9 months now, this DVD is still his favorite. The puppets are incredibly cute and funny, the music is pretty good, and the visuals are stunning. It is my favorite to watch also!! I would HIGHLY recommend this to slightly older babies. Baby McDonald is okay, but I am still waiting for Baby Neptune to grab his attention. For babies under 5 months, I think Bach and Mozart are the best. 
My son was over 2 before we introduced BE videos. There are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons. Unlike some of the other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired. Concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons. And no I didn't care for the commercial either... 
i placed two orders from this same seller for the same dvd and both came in very quickly in excellent condition there were no problems with making my payment or anything else thank you very much will be looking forward to ordering from you agan. i got two of the same video cuz my daughter wanted her own copy and needed one for the house als 
some the true lives of chicano/a in the california / texas etc area enjoyable 
I saw this movie Yeaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrs ago and the title popped into my head. This is such an intense film, the acting is very well performed. The characters, the plot, everything surrounding this film was well thought-out and organized. Definite 5 stars 
When I first saw this film, some five years ago, it truly knocked the breath out of me. For the first time, director Allison Anders gives us a glimpse into Mexican-American gang life in East LA's Echo Park, from the female perspective, this time. In the past, we have seen our share of male experiences (example being Zoot Suit, written by the playwright Luis Valdez). For once, we see the gritty side of the gang life, as young Mexicanas (or Chicanas, depending on who you ask) struggle to stay alive, amidst rampant drug dealing, the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them. Mi Vida Loca is actually a trilogy of stories. (Mousie Sad Girl, Lowrider and La Blue Eyes) The first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members, Mousie (Seidy Lopez) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles). These young women are best friends, until the day that Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend, Ernesto (Jacob Vargas), and becomes pregnant with his child. The world they knew before is ruptured, as is their lifelong connection as friends. The second story takes a glimpse in LowRider culture. This culture is perpetuated by, predominantly, young Chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing and airbrushing "low rider" cars (many, old school Chevies), complete with flashy airbrush images (example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations), trick tires and rims. This story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism, when the car takes on a life of its own. The third story is centered around La Blue Eyes, a beautiful BROWN-EYED woman who is writing to a convict, that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters. The question is, when they finally meet, will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter, or has the young woman ultimately been deceived, the whole time? I reccomend this film, if not for the fact that it is compelling, but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about. A very important study in gang life, and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news, but never get to know 
I love this movie!!! it is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!! it has so many things that poor hispanics and go through. Its kind of sterotypical but it is still a good movie!!! Yeah it is kinda of rough but it shows so much reality. It has sooooooo much drama and things just happen so randomly. I love this movie i would watch it every day if i could!! 
I love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways...thats where i got my nickname(giggles).I can really relate to Sad Girl .My friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching it..we all relate to it, like mousie,sadgirl,whisper,sleepy,ernesto,blueeyes.We enjoy it.Every one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life 
This movie reminds me of back in the dayz, growing up in Kali, I enjoyed because it puts out there the issues chicana girls have growing up, for other people that don't quite get Chicana Life this movie will help you understand, even though now in dayz it's not that harsh, growing up in city like L.A , the barrio is your familia if you want to survive the gang streets.... a must see movie overall!!! Chicana Love, La Travies 
this is a real good movie. better than american me in my opinion. when i first bought it i thought it would be okay but it turned out to be better than i thought. its about 2 best friends who turn on eachother after they both get pregnant by tha same drug dealer. after he dies they later realize always choose ur homegirl before any boy. tha story goes on about other events. tha only thing i didnt like about it was that i thought it ended too early. other than that this is a real good movie.. 
love this film. as i have reached the ripe old age of thirtysomething (no, don't get me started, I hated that show but cannot resist the anachronism) and am now married with 3 kids, it is just so funny to watch this movie again and relate to/get angry with the characters. been there...done that...and admittedly will probably do it again (and again) 
I WATCHED THIS FILM BACK IN THE 80'S WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED AND I LOVED IT.A REAL TEAR JERKER WITH A TINGE OF HUMOUR THROWN IN.A DEFINATE LADIES FILM I WOULD SAY AS A LOT OF BLOKES DON'T LIKE ALL THAT MUSHY STUFF.GOOD ACTING ALL AROUND FROM KEVIN BACON AND AN APPEARANCE BY A THEN DASHING ALEC BALDWIN LADIE'S FETCH THE HANKIES 
Since I ordered the video on February 13th - I was so impressed by how fast it arrived at my house!! Less than 24 hours later! 
This is just a wonderful, romantic, funny movie, which I finally just watched. This movie seems as timely today as it must have been when it was released in the late 1980s. I've always loved Kevin Bacon and this movie just confirms that he is a multitalented actor. Loved McGovern also as a young and happy wife. Wow, Alec Baldwin was good looking in his younger days! Anyways, this is a great movie. Kick off your shoes, get the popcorn and cozy up! 
*Spoiler Notice* Okay, so maybe the movie was a little quirky, but this was the eighties folks. The thing about this movie on a VERY personal level is that I gave birth to our daughter in 1988 my husband (at the wise old of nineteen, mind you) got to experience the feeling of watching me start to hemorrage (sp?) and be shuffled out of the delivery room with no explanation other than there was a complication. The thing is, while everything around me was in complete crisis, I kept hearing "Woman's Work" didn't have the fear that everyone around me did, I felt calm and reassured. The sound of Kate Bush is always welcome, but at a time like that, it's an absolute gift from the heavens after several blood transfusions, I got to see my little gift from the heavens - who is now 16! So, watch the movie for all of it, but remember that that situation can become very real, very quickly the movie portrayed it beautifully 
I love SHE'S HAVING A BABY Much,,especially That Song THIS WOMAN'S WORK..Kevin Bacon did great in this Movie,I have it ON LASERDISC,And I bought it on DVD too,,A MUST SEE !!! You won't REGRET IT :)) 
This movie is so comforting to me. Its sweet, funny and def. gives you a message. No matter how green the grass may seem (A man that has a lot on his plate: Kevin Bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman) it's not always. moral of the story is you need to go with your heart. He realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his "single self" I absolutely love this movie. love the music, love the actors, love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby. too funny! :) 
Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo. Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters. They are the traditional "Mars" and "Venus" symbols representing masculinity and femininity.  I also understand the last symbol representing "infinity", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of "eternal life" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity.  But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values? (The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity) I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot. Please also forward your thoughts to VBoston at aol.com. 
BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies. she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like "sweet sixteen" or "breakfast club". Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day. Soundtrac is great with kate bush "the woman's work". My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played. i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife. boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever. 
"She's Having A Baby" is a must for any fan of 80's films. If you *are* in fact having a baby or thinking about trying you will surely be able to find humor in watching this. Some people say this is a "chick-flick", but I think it is for anyone. This John Hughes film is another great one. I am happy to finally have the DVD. The soundtrack is great, too 
Bob Woodward, one of the real-life heroes in the movie, is still making news while reporting news at The Washington Post. That's amazing. I used to be a reporter, and still am a Democrat, (although a moderate now), and I never was a fan of President Nixon, so I loved it when it came out, I loved the book first, and I was glued to the TV set and the papers when the whole Watergate mess unfolded. But ignore politics if you can when watching this...there are crooks in both major parties, and [...], and dumb people promoted above their talents. This is well-written, well directed, and well-acted, and can be enjoyed just as entertainment here in the new century. Sadly, the Clinton Years and the Bush Years, too, offer the realization that Watergate-type conspiracies, designed to hold onto power, avoid scandal, or launder money, are still with us 
My 12th grade government teacher showed our class this film, and we were all hooked. If you have ever been in a room of thirty some teenagers, you know that its hard to get their attention and keep them quiet. So really, if a bunch of teenagers enjoyed this movie, everyone should consider giving it a chance. It might not be as action packed as some of the movies out today, such as 16 Blocks, but it's gonna keep your attention, so do yourself a favor and atleast rent it, you might find yourself coming back to buy it 
One of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist. Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States. Redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed. He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics. Redford has always been a political animal, with a reporter's instinct, and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the American political climate. Earlier, he and director Michael Ritchie had made THE CANDIDATE, a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women (and a film well worth your time). It took two years of hard work to get ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN off the ground. It was turned down by several studios, with the excuse that people were tired of Watergate, but he was finally able to get Warner Bros. to say yes, provided Redford himself would star. Dustin Hoffman was enlisted to play Carl Bernstein, Redford's old friend Jason Robards won an Oscar as Washington Post Editor-In-Chief Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden was cast as Editor Harry Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam was Editor Howard Simons, Jane Alexander was Judy Hoback, bookkeeper to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (C.R.E.E.P.), Ned Beatty was Martin Dardis, who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence, Stephen Collins was Hugh Sloan, whose wife Debbie (played by Meredith Baxter) kept his conscience working on the right side, Robert Walden (who would go on the the fine television series LOU GRANT) was Dirty Trickster Donald Segretti, and Hal Holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story: the mysterious Deep Throat, who helped Woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall. Of course, we now know that Deep Throat was the FBI's Assistant Director W. Mark Felt, an old friend of Woodward's and a man torn between his loyalty to the FBI and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on. Redford asked Alan J. Pakula to direct and Gordon Willis to handle the cinematography, and they crafted a look that is part documentary, part thriller. (If you get a chance, also see Pakula and Willis' THE PARALLAX VIEW, starring Warren Beatty. Another outstanding, scary political film.) William Goldman, who won an Oscar for BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, wrote the tight, exciting screenplay for which he won again (this was actually the fourth time Redford and Goldman had worked together; Goldman also adapted Donald E. Westlake's THE HOT ROCK, a very funny caper film, and the poignant THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, which was out for a short time on DVD in Pan and Scan, but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful Widescreen splendor. Universal, where are you?) The efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN a smashing success. It succeeds as an exciting, suspenseful procedural, as a statement on the neccessity of a free press, as a character study, and as a great movie-movie. The double-disc DVD set is the one to buy: the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp, clean 1:85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by Redford himself. The second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film, on Woodward and Bernstein, and on Deep Throat. There is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film, and an interview with Jason Robards on the Dinah Shore show. A deserved landmark in film and in journalism, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be, a must-own. In our darkest hour, when all seems obfuscated and hopeless, it reminds us that light can be brought to bear. People CAN make a difference 
Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman deliver Oscar worthy performances, while Jason Robards won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this movie which is (in my opinion) one of the best "political" films ever made. I'm not even sure if it was nominated for Best Picture, but I have to say...This movie was better than "Rocky" OK. The movie won four Academy Awards; The one I mentioned above, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound. It's also rated PG, which is strange because they use the word f**k at least 8 times in this movie and nowadays, two uses can get you slapped with an R rating. But the movie opens as we witness four men breaking into the Watergate Building, which we all know was the setting for Democratic National Headquarters. The police show up and catch the men in the act of setting up survelliance/bugging the place and the story shows up Bob Woodward's (Redford) desk. Woodward is a reporter at The Washington Post who reports the story and then begins to see oddities about it. Why would men break into the Democratic National Headquarters? Who sent them? Etc. Eventually joining in the act of helping him is Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) who begin a thorough investigation of the scandal that begins to turrn up names very high up in government and eventually even The President of the United States, Richard Nixon. Bernstein and Woodward worked their a$$es off to get this story, through apparent death threats and when people wouldn't talk to them, and they got it all right. Robards plays their boss, Ben Bradlee and deserved his Oscar. Another performance that was really good, although his face is almost entirely hidden in shadow is Hal Holbrook as the mysterious Deep Throat. Deep Throat was one of Woodward's informants who apparently worked high up in the government and seemed to know everything about the Watergate cover-up. Except he refused to just give up and information, only hints and could never be directly quoted or even referred to. Woodward, to this day has not given up the identity of Deep Throat or even gave the vaguest idea of who he might've been. Anyway, for a movie about reporters trying to unravel a cover-up, this movie was incredibly entertaining and exciting. It's never boring, it's never dull; both Hoffman Redford play their parts extraordinarily well, which causes us to like the movie even more. And it's strange too, the movie doesn't end with Nixon resigning; but instead ends with Nixon taking his 2nd Oath of Office. We're given the remainder of the details as they're typed up on a Typewriter. I though the ending was abrupt, but perfect. GRADE: A 
The newspaper room was alive and bustling with typewriters, we got an inside look at how reporting, editing, journalism to politics works...blah, blah...and so forth, which brings up an interesting question concerning the health of U.S. democracy under re-emergent conditions of clandestine acts of war consorting with a political machine. Maybe overlooking the theft of American elections should be looked on instead as a humanitarian gesture so that America can avoid succession by assassination like that strung from Kennedy, to Nixon to Regan. Don't ever listen to republican whining over measly office break-ins known as `Watergate'. It is an asinine snow job if ever there was. There is no `conspiracy' in arriving at, opening and then leaving a crime scene unprotected so people claiming to be `reporters' can carry away the evidence on a political assassin and plant any evidence they please, Bremer: More FBI pooh-pooh. There is no such thing as hiring muggers to do police crowd control in Manhattan in 1970. The republican party is an illegal Class C, totalitarian organizing. It should be hauled in and broken up before it pulls its next stunt. It is Clear and Present Danger to national security from totalitarianism. Copping to the lesser charge, actually came after an elaborate effort to posture innocence, when Nixon had to bluster to Flint (the FBI `deep throat' man) while Hoover's successor was away, that the detaining of Bremer should have been more brutal (even swearing for Pete's sake, gosh!). In another instance of primate aggression, Nixon had to thank personally the lunkheads who swung crowbars and wrenches at non-rioting student protestors. This is not a proboscis monkey who should ever have held public office, he would have looked good in stripes, somewhere with plenty of bars. Let me tell'ya, don't ever beat that monkey in a fair election. Not a good idea, and if you're running mate has to be from Texas (due to the way politicians get married off), never choose a man who has Mao and Saddam sized reliefs of himself in his Presidential Library. Why poke fun at his mug handles? Johnson didn't have to worry about `right from wrong', knowing "what `wuz' rite" saves at least half that effort. One of the slush funded wrecking crew perpetrators intimated their non-involvement by whining about Senate investigation asking familiars if he associated with Bremer. Always whine/deny before being put in the position of making denials. Anthropologists are not certain when planning ahead became a neocortex in those primates, but it seems to have put history in a revisionism spell; whining to steal the banana has become multi-dexterous, `five fingered' in its backward and forward directions. Even CBS'ers `Criminal Minds' has profiled the serial killer's habit of arriving early and often at the scene of their own crime, except that the lone assailant, nut-job model seems to be the chapter on criminal law they prefer above all others. Nixon telephoned a rather heated and timely self exoneration without skipping a beat, amazing the `deep-throat' operative Flint with a verbal lapse of decorum. Preemptive monkeyshine is about all I can call it. Flint's in the clear, has written a book and Bob Woodward has published in 2005, titled "The Secret Man". If that isn't good enough culpability, the FBI will take care of the more palpable actus rhesus. I mean actus reus, the non-tangential connection to either avoidance, nonfeasance, obstruction, or crime scene, open house tampering free-for-alls: candlestick, lead pipe, dagger, etc. It's important to improve the profile of the covert operative at the most open invitation to do a little trash removal and apartment restoration. Sort of perfect the identity, oh...write down a few emphatic journal entries...get rid of all the conflicting material and information aligning the agent with the political offense itinerary--Muskie. Did you know our doctrinal separation, supposed to provide the essential element of integrity, accountability, checks and balances has conflicted the appointing of the FBI's director? Not to mention the freaking Supreme Court Justice too!? I'd have to laugh if I didn't own it, along with you. In "The Secret Man", Woodward skips the mess Flint helped bury in the FBI's litter box surrounding the collusion and assistance to loot/alter the Bremer apartment crime scene investigation zone ; but in the original co-authored "All the President's men", Bernstein and Woodward do faithfully report the FBIs bungling in broad daylight with the nest of an obvious member of the slush-funded competition wrecking crew. Poor boy Bremer seemed to be quite the traveler on his measly $1,600 tax income claim, "stalking several candidates". We have Wikepedia the online free encyclopedia to thank for that citation on Arthur Herman Bremer; however their article blames the apartment owner for the ease of access to the press, not the FBI; Bernstein documents the FBI's arrival and then unattendence for an hour and a half--that's when rummaging was conducted by so called `reporters'. An expense account deficit is not a `conspiracy' (in the modern airhead vulgate), it is called evidence, and it is applied all the time in courts of law. Sorry to spoil the big revisionism on the legal entry in Blacks Law Dictionary, 8th, "Conspiracy"--a whole page of wry variations that is not a work of fiction. Woodward telephones Flint, at that time the number two man at the FBI, (media diversion revelation since 9-11 ). Flint won't discuss Watergate, even though they have had prior conversation about the Wallace assassination attempt. Flint says not to call him again, meetings are arranged with an outdoor semaphore and note left in Woodward's morning paper. In the first meeting of the Post's editors we see the demotion of the Bremer-diary story for a story about `McGovern offering the VP spot to everybody' after `The Eagleton Affair'. Never was George Wallace mentioned. Movies distort and attempt to revise history here, with likely planted disinformation. Monetary incentive fits Bremer's apartment doctored profile. The `Watergate'-construct in American history has and will crumble like the cheap plaster it is, similar to the Valarie Plane deception. 
This movie is a great accompaniment to PBS's recent documentary Watergate Plus: 30 Years later. We watched them back to back as PBS aired them this way as well 
President Nixon goes to Congress to address the nation. We see men with flashlights in a dark office building. A watchman notices something wrong, and calls the police. Five men in suits are caught during a burglary. Woodward is sent to cover this arrest. Woodward notices the unusual circumstances about these five, and begins to investigate their backgrounds. The film shows how a telephone was used to do this. You hear the tapping from many typewriters, now as obsolete as the sound of hooves on roads. Bernstein calls the library to get a list of books borrowed by Howard Hunt (do they still give out that information?) The denials point to a cover-up. [Note how paper records leave an audit trail; the current use of computers may prevent this.] Their story doesn't have enough facts for the front page. Woodward makes a phone call to a secret man [who he first called "My Friend"], then gets instructions for a secret meeting. Woodward is told to "follow the money". Bernstein goes to Miami and learns about Mexican checks. One check was given to Maurice Stans, then ended up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar! The film shows how "Wood-Stein" relentlessly search and interview a list of names. [These dollar figures are now way out of date.] Bernstein's low-key questions provide a tutorial on handling a scared witness. Then a tip leads to Segretti and information on more dirty tricks (infiltration of the opposite party). Their report about Haldeman is denied. Woodward meets his secret man and is told whether he is "hot" or "cold". Nixon is re-elected. Woodward and Bernstein continue to follow the story. The Teletype machine begins printing the names of the officials who pled guilty. The last item reports the resignation of Nixon. Was this another case where an experienced politician failed because his public morality did not match his private life? Did this President believe he could do no wrong and those who object are traitors? What is the lesson for today's America if a President illegally wiretaps people? One unanswered question: what was the state of Nixon's sanity? The purpose of the break-in was to plant forged documents showing the Democrats took money from foreign interests. The bugging of telephones was to gather dirty facts that could be used to force someone to appear as a false witness to these documents. Bob Woodward's book "The Secret Man" explains more about this political intrigue in Washington. Woodward spent four years in Naval Intelligence and met important people like the future head of the CIA, and a high-ranking member of the FBI. 
I am a big of fan of Shirley McLaine and Nicholas Cage. The movie begins and ends with comedy and drama. Nicholas plays a frustrated Secret Service agent to guard a former first lady played by McLaine and she keeps him on the run. The movie is wonderful. I highly recommend it. 
A very pleasant surprise, Guarding Tess, brings to the screen the story of a secret service agent guarding the widow of a former president and all that that entails. Could he possibly be biting more than he can chew? Even though the American Founding Fathers would probably not be pleased with the way their successors have been abusing their powers and with the "royal" treatment that they have been receiving (a far cry from the original humility and anti-monarchist rhetoric), one cannot stand idle and not recognize the strong bond that developed between the former first lady and her protector. Nicolas Cage, Shirley MacLaine, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, Guarding Tess is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! 4 1/2 Stars 
doug [nicolas cage] is an fbi agent assigned to guard tess [shirley mclaine] a widowed, former first lady. he is a rules and regulations guy with no spontaniety, she is a free spirit with little tolerance for the fbi's button-down world. prior to being assigned to tess, doug worked under her husband, the president. one day while watching videotape of her husband's funeral, tess sees doug become emotional, a rare opportunity to see him vulnerable. it's obvious they have more in common than at first glance. doug is tested later and comes to realize he cares for her very much. great movie, with a lot of heart and humanity 
This is the first time that I thought a movie was not worth seeing and waited until it hit a premium movie channel. This time I will admit I made a mistake. This movie was fun to watch. It is well written and the interactions of the two main actors show a great chemistry. Nicolas Cage plays the Special Agent in Charge of the Secret Service detail guarding a former First Lady. The First Lady is played well my Shirley MacLaine. The agent feels he is wasted in such a detail and wants desperately to get back on detail to the White House...and the First Lady wants him to stay. The two seem to thrive on confrontation with each other. She does her best to break every procedure the Secret Service is supposed to follow. If you pay attention in the movie you will see why the First Lady actually loves the agent so much and wants him with her. And I think the picture shows us a very accurate relationship that occurs between agent and his protectee. Though it could be seen as a comedy; there is a just enough drama and a mystery which Cage character solves. A very well directed with perfect pace and timing. I look forward to buying it and watching it again. 
This is one of the greatest movies I have watched. I know I have probably watched the movie twenty times in the past. It has heart and compassion. It is absolutely one of the best I have see 
Guarding Tess is a pretty good comedy drama that becomes a fair suspense drama by the end. Nicolas Cage (Matchstick Men) plays a Secret Service agent in charge of guarding an obstinate former first lady, first widow Carlisle, played by Shirley MacLaine (The Sheepman). Cage wants out of the job to move on to a more important / exciting assignment, but MacLaine bends the ear of the current President to keep him. Arguments between the two are amusing and interesting as they each maneuver to get their own way. Cage insists on following rules to the letter to try to irritate her into releasing him - but she always seems to have more power. The supporting cast includes Edward Albert as Mrs. Carlisle's son, and Austen Pendleton as the driver who's with the first widow .. when ... she ..... disappears..... 
When "Guarding Tess" was released eight years ago, I ended up watching it in the theater because I was bored and because it looked a little more promising than the rest of the pack. That thought proved to be an understatement. To date, I have seen this movie at least eight times, and I tend to enjoy it more with each viewing. Nicholas Cage is perfect as the disgruntled Secret Service agent who feels he has been banished to his current duty -- namely, doting on a cantankerous former First Lady, played to the hilt by Shirley MacLaine. "Guarding Tess" is alternately funny and moving, and even includes a bit of a mystery for Cage to solve. Far more than a one-dimensional film, "Guarding Tess" is satisfying for so many reasons -- the witty script, the fine performances, the deft direction, and the mostly even pacing, to name a few. While you can catch this on a regular basis on TBS (which has made the movie one of its most reliable staples), "Guarding Tess" is definitely worth owning for more frequent viewing 
I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS. It's now 11:30PM, and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago. Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot. There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life. I was touched by the movie. Thank you. I should go to bed now 
The gift is a film about Annie Wilson a young woman with very real telepathic talents. Widow and mother of three, Annie Wilson, makes her living by foretelling others' futures, though her own has become cloudier than even she can see. Threatened by a client's violently jealous husband and plagued by visions of a missing towns-girl, Annie is unwittingly pulled into a thicket of lies and deception in which her extraordinary gift could be used against her and get her killed.I knew someone who was gifted, and from what I can tell, the movie was pretty accurate. And the musical score just heavenly. 
This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the "Spider-Man" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then. Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie. Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child. While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy. In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us. The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's "Furniture Room Lullaby" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer 
This movie has great casting. The actors play characters that they usually don't play. This may be the best acting I have ever seen Keeanu Reeves do 
The Gift is a riveting, very well-acted movie about a woman named Annie (Blanchett) who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her 3 young sons. She gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town. One of her clients (Swank, who you can always count on for a remarkable performance) has an abusive husband (Reeves, fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here) who thinks what Annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again. Then, the daughter (Holmes) of an important man goes missing. She's engaged to a man named Wayne who works at the school where Annie's boys go (I believe he is the principal, but I could be mistaken...sorry, but in any event, played by Greg Kinnear). But there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale, and soon the police, with no clues as to where the daughter is, turn to Annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction. I won't spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen The Gift. Look for an amazing Giovanni Ribisi in the substory as well...he's terrific here. If you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot, The Gift is something you will surely treasure as I have. Even if you question the validity of psychic readings, this is a very interesting movie that's best viewed with an open mind. Very recommended 
I really liked this movie and think is too underrated. It has a great story line and plot. Although Katie Holmes has a small part it is a good one. I really enjoyed this one. HAs quite a few twists as well 
I don't know if I'd say this is a VERY creepy film like "The Ring" and almost scary, but it certainly is strange, starting with the plot: Annie Wilson {Cate Blanchett} is a psychic who's "gift" is to see the future, and/or what has recently happened in a certain place, and she reads cards to the local people. When someone she knows mysteriously disappears, no one can find her. Sooner or later {after she is found dead}, the ghost of this woman haunts Annie and this "gift" is like something to protect Annie and her family, but in the process, the following situations become somewhat disturbing as the movie goes on because the acting and the cast are very well done. The characters make you have opinions about them. This movie is just so weird it's pretty tough to explain every detail...but then I'd be spoiling it, wouldn't I 
The Gift is a chilling tale set in the south written by Billy Bob Thornton, the talented man that also wrote Sling Blade. First off, it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GIVE THIS MOVIE LESS THAN 3 STARS. Why? Because of the incredible cast. Here, you'll find probably one of the best casts ever. It has Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear, an actor whom I can't remeber his name but who is brilliant and Keannu Reeves. Keannu Reeves? A good actor? Damn straight. He was brilliant in this movie and deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. I am not kidding. His performance was remarquable! The movie is about a widow, mother of 3, making her money as a psychic. But, she gets involved with a woman whose abusive boyfriend is ready to do anything. This psychic is a scared mother that only seems to be loved and watched over by one person. And only one. You'll find that one out on your own. This movie is packed with suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. So, watch this brilliant movie that I will definitely add to my collection 
If you are a Sam Raimi fan then you know that his old car is always featured somewhere in his movies. This movie is great in every aspect but especially because if features "The Classic"( which is what Sam calls this car) in almost every scene. This adds a touch of comic delight to a very tense and suspenceful movie. This role is usually filled by Bruce Campbell but in lieu of his precense "The Classic" is a worthy stand in. All kidding aside this is an excellent movie and well worth your time. Keanu Reeves gives an excellent turn as a creepy wife beater. Cate Blanchet is as always flawless. Every role is excellently cast and acted with skill by all. Sam's direction is always great and this is no exception. 
An outstanding, beautifully produced movie with an exceptional cast. Anyone who enjoys historically-based dramas will certainly find this movie quite captivating. 
The intent of the director was to capture the ATMOSPHERE or "flavor" of the Elizabethan court. Intrigue, alliances, deceit, ambitions, trechery and emotions. In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands. On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere. Those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point. An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more. The movie probably could have been a little longer as it is. Worthy of multiple viewings 
This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong. Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
Very few historical movies are historically accurate. Who cares? That is not the point. If anyone relies on movie to get their history lessons, then they are pitiful in the first place. The primary purpose of movies is to entertain. Its likely that anyone interested in 'Elizabeth' is not the run of the mill 'Die Hard' fan to begin with, and probably has some true historical knowledge. Those seeking historical facts should visit their local library and stay away from the video store. 
To borrow from a previous reviewer: A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering. 
To those of you, who have yet to realize what an amazing actress Cate Blanchett is, look no further than 'Elizabeth'. The characters, the costumes, and the production designs are good enough to make this movie watch able, but it's Blanchett who breathes life into the film and makes it cinema storytelling at its best. The story revolves around the rise of the young Queen Elizabeth I (Blanchett) who would soon become one of England's most powerful rulers. Reviled as a heretic by the Catholic Church, surrounded in the midst of traitors, and caught up in a romance with a young Lord that could jeopardize her crown, Elizabeth is forced to learn that as a queen... she must become untouchable in order to maintain her throne. The supporting cast does an excellent job with special nods to the ever elegant Geoffrey Rush, but it's Blanchett who manages to steal each and every scene. Her performance was more than Oscar worthy, and is surely one of her best. Some have compared this with `Shakespeare in Love' which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year. Both are good films, but whereas `SIL' plays generally for laughs, Elizabeth is a serious film that should be taken seriously. There are historical plot holes - but these should not be used as a reason for slating the film. In fact it seems that Hollywood encourages this type of approach these days. There are any numbers of unexplained actions, and characters are sometimes hard to identify, but the camera work, color, and scenic backgrounds are superb. Locations are all real, and the acting is uniformly convincing. If an initial viewing leaves you a tad confused, do a little reading on the period, see the film again, and enjoy it all the more. 
I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie. 
I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film. But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor. Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes. And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever. I was sorely disappointed! If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson. And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell. Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days. Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times. This film just doesn't cut it 
In terms of both format and style, "Rent" - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots fairly firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition. Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters. In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings. This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience. I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts. The story, a modern day update of "La Boheme" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990. This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story). There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them "deadbeats") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block. "Rent" - with its noble "performance artists" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's. Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical "Angel") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man). Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America. When one of the men finally takes a dreaded "job" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck. I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them. With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing. In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching. Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene. As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling. One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of "the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music. It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations. There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture. In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it. I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for "Rent" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially "sensitive" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free 
I saw the Broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the DVD, I think that everyone should see this movie over and over again. Chris Columbus has done a wonderful job bringing this musical to film and keeping Jonathan Larson's ideals and thought-provoking view and dreams alive. The actors are first rate! They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable. I am happy to have the deleted scenes as a bonus in the DVD. I wish that Chris had kept "Goodbye Love" in the film, but thank god we have a chance to see it. It is a scene that has to be seen by all! The documentary on the Disc 2 is something I am privleged to have watched and I'm so happy to now know how Jonathan Larson lived his life. No day but today!! 
Not following the recent Broadway scene very much, I wasn't really aware of what a sensation "Rent" was several years ago when it debuted. I became more aware of it when it was satirized in the Southpark picture "Team America" and after my church intergenerational choir sang the show's "theme" song "Seasons of Love". Then one of the kids that I worked with in a local musical said Rent was one of his favorites, so I was a first-weekend attendee at the theatre. The story is important as it depicts gays, lesbians, drag queens and drug addicts as real people struggling with life, love (and AIDS) just like so-called "normal" people. Being in the rock style, the songs aren't necessarily "toe-tappers" that you end up whistling on the way out of the theatre (though "Seasons of Love" comes close, particularly if you've sang it at least two dozen times, and "La Vie Boheme" is a showstopper--the plot is supposedly based on the opera of that name), but overall the music is very exciting and integral to the story. The cast moved almost en masse from Broadway to Hollywood--Wilson Heredia, a Tony winner as drag queen Angel, should have contended for an Oscar as Supporting Actor. I've read that there was some concern about mainstream Hollywood director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter I and II) getting the job, but I don't see that the picture suffered for it--maybe some unconvincing special effects are the worst of it. As a rock opera, it takes some time to get used to having almost all the dialogue sung rather than spoken. Overall another solid four star film----definitely recommended to fans of modern musicals, to those in marginalized communities, and to those with art in their souls. P.S. Afterwards I got hooked on the soundtrack CD for a few weeks (months?) but that's another review 
I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less. I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs! 
I absolutely love this film. It is one of the best ever. I have been dying to see it on Broadway, but haven't been able to. It's so hard to anyways with Broadway being so expensive. But the film is amazing. The original cast of the broadway show - save for two - are in this film and it's great. I love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really, and I mean, really know how these characters are. It's a great film. It brings a new light to those that haven't heard of the show before. And it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture. AIDS, lesbians, gays, druggies. And it's just a great film. I related to Mark the most, because of how he loves to film things. I think that there is a "RENT" character for everyone! I give the movie a 10 out of 10!!! 
I have to say...I was a little weary when i decided to see this movie...alot of my friends raved about it, but im so picky, i didnt think id like it. so i watched it and i was blown away. i cried the first few times i saw it. I must've watched it about 10-20 times and i can never get enough. it is beautifully done. the music is excellent. the casting was clear perfection. i give props to the writer of the original play...what a masterpiece i could rave forever and ever about it. the storyline is such like todays life...paying rent sucks, and its nearly impossible to get good money around here. i could rant and rave for hours. all i have to say is, if you havnt seen it, it is a must for anyone over the age of around 15...the topics can get a little mature. but it really is worth it 
I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character. Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so "out there" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually. You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of "I'll Cover You", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie. Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material. 
Great music. Makes you want to get up and dance - or sing - or both. Filming in a New York winter helps to really bring you into their angst. I loved it 
Hirohito has always been something of a puzzle to me. As a teenager in the 1980s, I would see this man on the news and wonder why on earth he was still the emperor of Japan. During his reign, Japanese forces committed untold atrocities against the Chinese and all manner of other Asian peoples, Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor in a treacherous sneak attack, Japanese soldiers killed many brave American soldiers, and Japan was forced to sign terms of unconditional surrender. It made no sense to me that Hirohito was still the emperor of Japan, a man who was never forced to pay any real price at all as a war criminal. Even the Japanese people continued to revere him, seemingly holding no grudges over the destruction American forces and bombs brought to the Japanese homeland in 1945. This Biography video sheds light on Hirohito and his Japan, but it fails to deliver on its promises. At the outset, Jack Perkins tells me this video will reexamine Hirohito's role in the attack on Pearl Harbor and seemingly argue that he played a larger role than history and myth tell us; frankly, there is no explication of this issue to be found here. If nothing else, this documentary shows that Hirohito was an exceedingly weak and ineffective emperor, a man lacking the backbone to stand up to his advisors and the military leaders of Japan. He obviously was a good learner, though, as his advisors supposedly taught him from a young age to be a passive ruler. By the 1930s, military leaders saw depression and the dangers of a reunified China as their chance to pursue their own aggressive goals. Without Hirohito's knowledge, they attacked Manchuria, then attacked the Chinese heartland (torturing and massacring up to two hundred thousand people in the infamous Rape of Nanking). Hirohito opposed such actions, we are told, and was horrified by the atrocities committed in his name. He was too passive, however, to do anything to stop the army's aggression. Certainly, the fact that the military assassinated six prime ministers during the 1930s would make one reticent to speak out against them, but an emperor is supposed to lead his country. Hirohito, though, backed down from his anti-military wishes time and time again, eventually acquiescing altogether to everything that happened: Japan's abandonment of the League of Nations, its militaristic aggression, and of course the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is most ironic that the military played up Hirohito's supposed divine nature and made him the rallying cry of its own aggressions. This video explains why Hirohito stayed on the throne (now officially a figurehead) after World War II. MacArthur, as well as planners in Washington, thought he would serve as a stabilizing force in the chaotic days following the war. Rather than being castigated as a collaborator, the Japanese people continued their support for the emperor, which amazes me. He became a symbol of Japan' new middle class and eventually a good will ambassador. He never expressed regret about Japanese atrocities during the war, and he never paid any price for his role in events - in which he was, if nothing else, complicit. These facts were never truly forgotten in the west, however, as some world leaders were criticized for attending Hirohito's funeral in 1989. This would be an excellent video were it not for the introductory promise to shed new light on Hirohito's role in the attack on Pearl Harbor; all we are told on this point is that he seemingly nodded in acquiescence to the plan, showing no uneasiness with the decision. Other than this, all we get are old and tired excuses: he felt powerless to stop the plans, and he feared the possibility of a coup against him. He was angry that Japan attacked before declaring war, though; that, we are told, is the only thing about Pearl Harbor that made him angry. This documentary shows that Hirohito was a very fortunate man. He was a spineless leader who did not dare command his military to rein themselves in and do his wishes; he witnessed the destruction of his country by allied bombs; and he never faced charges of war crimes or lost his throne over the carnage carried out in his name. Despite all this, he retained his seat as emperor, enjoyed great popularity among his people, and lived the easy life for 44 years after the war. This biographical presentation does a fine job of describing Hirohito's life, but it leaves many questions - including some it poses at the beginning - unanswered 
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There was absolutely no plot. Nothing. It was a complete waste of my time and taught me nothing about the Cuban experience in NYC. I love most Cuban movies, and all movies by this director. But, el Super was horrible 
A MOVIE UNLIKE ANY I HAD EVER SEEN, CLEARLY MADE BY THE LENS OF SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING AN ALIEN IN A NEW COUNTRY. WITTY, FUNNY AND PROFOUND AT THE SAME TIME. HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE 
Eden was superb in the lead. She was amazing at conveying both sex appeal and innocence at the same time. The characters on the show are sometimes a little uneven by the way they're written from ep to ep but the talent of the actors overcomes this small fault. I liked the show much better when it switched to color (it was rather dour in black and white). And I like the married Genie stories as much as the eps where's she is single. 
G'D bless you Michael Moore for your crusades not only in the books you have written but also for your doccumentary movies to safeguard the working man blue collar workers. The Big One is depressing and funny at the same time. His political satire and savy humour helps you deal with the horrible reality of the coruption in government and in corporations in america. It is about time someone stood up to the corruption of the ceos and corporations. G'D gave michael moore the heart and the guts to go out there and fight the good fight not only for faith but also for justice. 
This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous. Being that it is a Michael Moore movie I should have expected this but I tried to view it openly. Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars 
I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania that had a lot in common with the small cities of the midwest. There was one employer that paid well and supported the town, and when they moved out the unemployment levels went to Great Depression levels. My hometown took its hit in the 80's during the Regan Administration. Steel was being "offshored" to Japan and put most of the steel mills out of business, and, in turn, lowered the demand for coal. Now, Roger Moore exposes the biggest failure of the Clinton Administration, NAFTA. H. Ross Perot predicted that if NAFTA were signed we would here a giant sucking sound of all the jobs going to Mexico... and we sure did! After NAFTA was signed, many jobs (especially high paying union jobs) were exported to Mexico where laborers are exploited much more easily. The result was catastrophic job loss for the manufacturing centers in the midwest. The film has an "in your face" style as Roger Moore confronts those lining their pockets with riches as hardworking people are merely shoved aside. I watched the film in a sociology class in college. I suggest it for anyone entering the workforce! You won't regret watching this 
No one goes after the "bad guys" like Michael Moore. He is relentless asking big business why not take care of the working man who put you where you are today? He asks the simple question, why not share the wealth? He pursues the answers to these questions in a humorous and compassionate manner. Being a working woman myself, and working in the auto industry, I appreciate where this documentary comes from 
Ever since I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11" (which I thought was ferociously hilarious), I had been trying to check out Michael Moore's earlier work (both books and films). I finally got around to see "The Big One" this weekend. I felt like I could really relate to Michael's disdain for corporate America having had spent time working for a major corporation myself. I could relate to the employees of various corporations who have continually gotten screwed over by the corporate machine. I think it is hilarious how Random House tried to reign in Michael's shenanigans during his book tour with their escorts. While there are lots of hilarious moments when Michael tries to confront various company CEOs on why they are laying off their employees when they are making a good amount of cash, there is also a good mix of drama. One of my favorite moments in the film was when Michael went to the capital in Wisconsin to talk to then Governor Tommy Thompson about his welfare reform policies with two women who were living below poverty level. Apparently the new welfare reform policy Tommy signed when he was governor doesn't work for everyone. I love the politician Michael and the women confront in the state capital was the equivalent of a snake oil salesman, no one was buying his schpiel because those women went through the process of the new welfare reform and they were still living below poverty. One of the most personal and touching moments was when Michael was at a book signing at Borders' bookstore and one of the people in line was a woman who was recently laid off from Ford co.. I was moved by Michael's concern for the woman. I also liked his conversations with other people like the diners in Iowa (I think) and just getting their overall opinions on the presidential election in '92. Like his other films, "The Big One" mixes biting satirical humor with real-life drama. Michael Moore's movies to me are like the MTV show "Punk'd" with a socio-political message and without that talent-challenged Ashton Kutcher 
This is unreal. Of all the CEO types with which Michael Moore spoke to, not one of them answered his question - If companies are making record profits (some in the billions) then why are there so many layoffs? The man from NIKE said that he wouldn't open a shoe factory in the US because he doesn't think Americans would want to make shoes. You've got to see this to believe. Michael Moore is a genius 
Many of the other reviews have summarized Akira Kurosawa's excellent film, so I won't recap it since you are probably familiar with The Seven Samurai. Rather, if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release, rest easy. It is well worth the price. Having seen the movie many, many times, I was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seen new and brought out many details I had missed. The supplemental materials (commentaries, documentaries, interviews, and the booklet (with reminiscences from Mifune Toshiro) complement the movie nicely. If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it. This DVD is worth it 
Thank You Criterion. I just finished watching the new 3 DVD set and it is wonderful! The movie itself has been beautifully restored as only Criterion can. The sound is also very well done....there are not enough wonderful things I can say about the job they did on this film. The third disc is a treat. It was very interesting watching the interview with Akira. The back ground on the movie and the rare trailers were a terrific new addition for this release. Bravo! I cant wait for more 
I've owned the original Criterion version of Seven Samurai. It was nice owning this fantastic movie, especially since it had the Criterion stamp. When the new, 3-disc version came out, I read numerous reviews stating how much of an improvement it was from the first edition. And I am in full agreement. I've never written a review for Amazon.com before, but I feel compelled because of how impressed I am with these DVDs. Criterion has really cleaned up this new version. It blows the older version away. It looks like it was filmed yesterday. The extras are really awesome and the booklet is nice and informative. This is the definitive edition of this wonderful movie and Kurosawa's masterpiece. Well worth the money 
akira kurosawa's masterpiece gets the 'do-over' from criterion. this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film, absolutely no question about it. i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras, let alone watch the movie all the way through. i'm one of those frame-by-frame, shot-by-shot viewers. i have seen the film several times over the years, mostly on criterion's original release of the film, this is going way back. if you have never seen this film don't waste your time with any other version than this one. it does not disappoint. KYDU 
This film only gets better to me with every viewing. And now, with this great new release from Criterion, I can see it in an even clearer light. A great transfer accompanied by fantastic extras that give you insight and information on this film that is hard to find elsewhere. It's like Seven Samurai Film School in a box. There will never be another release to top this one and probably never another film. A must have for Kurosawa and film fans 
I picked this one up mostly because I wanted to see why Directors like Sergio Leone and George Lucas were inspired by this film. It's easy to see why. This is an epic in the same vien as "The Last Samuri" only it is conciderably better and lacks Tom Cruise which is a good thing. The battles and fight scenes are wonderful. The wet muddy battles looked great on a very nice DVD transfer. The picture looked pretty damn good. I usually am not a huge forien film fan, and I don't usually like subtitles but this movie was so good that non of that bothered me. If you liked The American version of this film, The Magnificent Seven' I deffinetly recomend this. An all time great 
The Seven Samurai was the basis for that wonderful western The Magnificient Seven, but is in every way a superior movie. The lighting, the camera angles and acting are all first class. The director is brilliant. Enjoy this treasure 
Seven Samurai is really the greatest story ever told! I won't go into why here because there are plenty of reviewers both here and elsewhere on the internet who do a much better job than I ever could. This brand new Criterion reissue that improves on the older one in every way so you have no excuse not to buy it right now 
Since there are over 300 reviews of this magnificent film already posted, I would like to discuss some aspects of this film that are rarely discussed. The first of these two themes is the various roles and attributes of the heroic male. The second of the two themes is the depiction of classism and a stratified society. However, before I comment on these two themes I must praise Kurosawa, the Director, for the incredible battle scenes. The level of realism, chaos, and accident is very high, giving the viewer a superb look into battle. As the layout of the village is drawn and repeatedly shown to the viewer in Kambei's maps, we fully understand the battleground and the rationale for defending specific sites and barrocading others. We understand Kambei's master strategy and its execution. We understand when it goes wrong or astray and we watch Kambei immediate correct the situation if possible. We see beserk men hacking at each other rather than an over stylized ballet posing as a battle scene. These battle scenes are masterful and rare. That being said, I would like to discuss the two themes I outlined above. First, we see three distinct ways or paths of the hero in this film. We see the character Kyuzo, the master swordsman, a completely skilled killing machine, swift as a scorpion and calm as a cool breeze. He is a craftsman, sure of his talent and skill. He is also serene, having obviously attained a detachment from emotion and day-to-day worries. He takes his skill seriously, as seen in his first scene where a dueling partner progresses from sticks to swords and Kyuzo kills him within seconds. A second revealing scene is the great sequence where wildman Kikuchoiyo and steel-nerved Kyuzo become a team to track and kill the three bandit scouts. The third scene is wisely left to our immagination. Kyuzo learns that three of the bandits hidden in the forrest around the village has a rifle. Kyuzo leaves the compound alone in the fog of night and many hours later returns with a rifle in hand. He hands the rifle to Kambei and goes calmly to sleep. We see that Kyuzo, though a self contained killing machine, can work in partnership with a wildly unpredictable partner as well as follow instructions from the wise leader, Kambei. Kyuzo is seen in all cultures and in all times. He is the totally proficient warrior. He is the warrior that all younger warriors wish to emulate. But he is incomplete because he lacks one virtue, purpose beyond himself. Yet he is wise enough to be persuaded by Kambei and to follow Kambei's wise direction. It is purposefully ironic that Kyuzo is shot in the back by one of the three rifles in the film, since no one can beat him face to face with sword technology. The character of Kikuchoiyo, the wild man who wishes to become a Samurai, the man who can not contain his energy or emotion, the force of nature, is an incredible character. He is the exact opposite of Kyuzo, the serene killing machine. He has little control of his emotions, is spontaneous and rage driven. Yet his character undergoes the most transformation in the film. He goes from being a lying drunken bully imposter to a force of great good, primarily through the strategic hands off mentoring of Kambei. We learn that he is not from a Samurai family but is the orphan of farmers killed by bandits. Kikuchoiyo first gives us a hint as to his background when he informs the samurai that farmers always have hidden resources on which to call, this secrecy being necessary for thier survival. However when the bandits attack the old miller and his family in the grist mill, Kikuchoiyo comes to the rescue and saves a baby boy from the dying arms of its mother. Kikuchoiyo breaks down in mid-action, holding the child in a stream with warfare surrounding him, and wails that this exact thing happened to him as a child. In the Jungian sense, Kikuchoiyo reclaimed his orphan child self at this point, he saves a real child but he also saves an inner psychic child within himself and thus this allows him to be a true Samurai rather than an imposter Samurai. He is a fighting force, full of emotion and power. He taps into the natural, biological forces of injustice in the final battle scenes. Ironically, this is what brings about his end, for those who fight with pure emotion exceed their bounds. When the rifleman bandit kills Kyuzo from behind a wooden screen, Kikuchoiyo is overtaken with rage and attacks the screen trying to pull it apart to reach the bandit. He takes a bullet in the belly but goes on fighting until he collapses. This brings us to the final penacle of heroism, Kambei, the mastermind Samurai leader with a vast range of intellectual, interpersonal, and warrior skills. Kambei has a range of leadership skills including; ability to make realistic assessments so as not to support unrealistic optimism, ability to use small resources to bring down much larger forces, ability to fight on the edges, the fringes, to deplete the resources and power of his enemy, ability to mentor other men by drawing out their unique talent and using that talent for the greater good, ability to judge the greater good from immediate gains, ability to change course in the middle of battle when the facts reveal that a new strategy is needed, abiltiy to recover quickly from loss and mve forward, and an ability to use humor and a personal relationship to move men toward action. Finally, he has incredible humility which allows him to make realistic assessments of conditions and resources and dynamics. Humility is an underestimated asset. Humility is essential to the leader because egotism and grandiosity cloud a man's vision. Humility keeps vision clear - an essential for survival and leadership. Now we come to the second theme of the film, which is understanding the actions of all the characters witin a context of classism and a stratified society. The meek, clownlike, foolish farmers gradually are seen as far from timid fools. They survive amidst overwhelming odds. They hire ronin, which were the masterless unemployeed samurai soldiers that roamed Japan in the 16th century. In the end, four of the seven samurai are burried with distinction in the village cemetary, but as Kambei points out, it is the farmers that won the battle, they overcame a threat to their existence, the samurai being a tool by which they overcame the threat. When the village women kill a single bandit in a chicken house using garden hoes, we see evidence of the willingness of these farmers to fight for survival. However, the farmers, like the samurai, owe much to the realistic strategic leadership of Kambei. Within this epic masterpiece are two subplots of great interest. First, young farmer Rikichi always seems to be hiding something and as the story progresses we learn that his young wife was stolen by the bandits and is now their sex slave. Rikichi volunteers to attack their camp and we learn it is to find his wife. However, as he peeps into the bandit lair, he sees her despondent and in deep grief. When she sees flames at both ends of the shack, her first instict is to scream, but her second is to remain silent in hopes that she and the bandits will all burn to death. She eventually runs from the shack but when she sees Rikichi, her overwhelming shame forces her to run back into the burning building where she is lost. The second subplot was the seduction of the young warrior Katshushiro by Shino, the daughter of Farmer Manzo. I have never seen such masterful body language as is demonstrated by Shino as she seduces the young man while maintaining the pretend role of the persued. This is a fantastic work of art that almost defies description due to its depth and mastery of storytelling. It is a film where many forces of art converge to produce a rare masterpiece. 
Seven Samurai is the greatest film made by perhaps the world's greatest film director. The string of films from Rashomon to Red Beard represents an almost unbroken run of classic films (all but one starring Toshiro Mifune), not the least for the fact that Akira Kurosawa was able to infuse humanism and populism amongst the chaos and indifference in a wide variety of settings. Individuals could make a difference in an indifferent society (Ikiru, Red Beard) or work together for a common cause (Seven, Sanjuro), while in other films the inhumanity of class culture (The Lower Depths, Stray Dog, High and Low) was laid bare. Yet at other times, it could be seen that Kurosawa soured on the idea that society could change for the better in films like The Bad Sleep Well and Record of a Living Being, giving way to the chaos of Fortress of Blood and Yojimbo. But whether pessimistic or optimistic, Kurosawa's films seldom fail to both entertain and inform. Seven Samurai's principle strength is that it manages to do both on an extraordinarily high level. For a film of this length (three hours and 27 minutes) there is almost no wasted footage; nothing here is simply there to be pretty and fill-in a slow patch. Everything has a purpose; there is nothing mysterious about the motivations of the bandits, the conflicting attitudes of the villagers, the quiet charisma of Kambei (Takashi Shimura) which binds the samurai to a cause for which there is little to be gained besides a meal and possibly death. From the beginning there is a logical progression of human action in relation to the problem at had. The viewer has the feeling that the film has a completeness that other epic films strive for but fail to achieve. Although at times it may seem otherwise to a viewer weaned on non-stop violence or cheap emotion, Seven is never a dull polemic. Humor abounds, and conflicts between villagers and/or the samurai are often accentuated to elicit maximum (but never melodramatic) emotional effect. Even during periods of quiet contemplation, Kurosawa won't let the incongruities of human existence escape unnocticed: Kyuzo sits under a tree reflecting on a flower he has picked, and an instant later he rises to kill two bandits just as serenely. When they come, the battle sequences are given over to realism, not style; watching the attack on the bandits' hideout, we are amazed that unlike the stylized wire-fu in current films, we see men who don't have time to pose simply hacking away before they get hacked. In the final battle sequence, Kurosawa turns up the authenticity to a fever pitch. We become so involved in the fighting ourselves that by the time the naï¿½ve, innocent Katsushiro is overcome with bloodlust we too are disappointed that all the bad guys are already dead. Unlike the original Criterion release, the film is split on two discs rather than one, apparently to accommodate a slightly improved video transfer and two additional audio tracks, one a new 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, the other a new commentary track. Michael Jeck's audio commentary is a holdover from the first release, and for me it is preferable since like the film it is lean and to the point--and doesn't drown out the film track, so that one can enjoy the film with the benefit of Jeck explaining cultural idiosyncrasies and film technique. The new commentary track is split between a half-dozen film critics, one taking over a particular section of the film from the other. This gimmick is at times disconcerting, and while it may be of some interest to hear a variety of opinions, the fact that they don't compete with one another means we don't learn anything much that is new. As one might expect from a three-disc set there are a few supplements (whether they are worth the $49.99 price tag may be a matter of conjecture). The most interesting to me of these is "My Life in Cinema" in which Kurosawa discusses the evolution of his art. At the outset the interviewer tells him that his tall stature is not "typical" of the Japanese; as the discussion goes on, apparently neither does the conformist Japanese stereotype apply to him. Despite his reputation on the set, here we see an often bemused, modest and self-deprecating individual; "Foreigners treat us (Japanese filmmakers) like VIPs; in Japan we're treated like tramps" he jokes at one point. Two additional documentaries are the serviceable overview of the film (from the "It is Wonderful to Create" series) and of the samurai film genre, "Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences." There is also a small booklet which contains a few brief comments from a variety of individuals, the one of greater interest is provided by Mifune, who like some other great actors of our time didn't take himself or his profession too seriously. We certainly get the sense that Mifune was proud to be a part of Seven Samurai, but as for having fun doing it, that was another matter. If a film ever deserved special edition treatment, it is Seven Samurai. I would have preferred a more thorough and penetrating making-of documentary for a film of this caliber, and I suspect the price may scare away all but the most devoted film aficionados. Still, if you have to have it, you have to have it. 
After the first time doing this, my arms and upper body were sore for 2 days! This tape works muscles I didn't even know I had. Suzanne's yoga syle of exercise is very relaxing too. After the workout, you'll feel refreshed and energized. Pair this tape with another BalanceBall workout, and you'll have a great hour of exercise 
Another great Deason workout. Really challenges those upper body muscles. Great for the arms, back, abs, etc 
It combines yoga &amp; pilates by using just a ball which in turn is loved by my 5-month old boy. It's creative &amp; helps create awareness in movements. Unlike weight-training, this ball-exercise is more interesting &amp; efficient. Bravo 
More than 20 years old now and a little dated, Spinal Tap is still loads of fun with the "mockumentary" gang including Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (who did the delightful "Best in Show" in 2000). Every aspect of `60s and `70s rock music is lampooned. Surprisingly, director/interviewer Rob Reiner comes off a little flat--but maybe that's just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters. "Big Bottom" (a sendup of "Fat Bottomed Girls"--one of my politically incorrect favorites), the "sophisticated" "Sex Farm", and the controversial "Smell the Glove" (ultimately released as Tap's "Black Album") are among "Tap's" big hits. 
How many times have you seen the "special edition" label in a DVD cover? Many times i`m sure, but that could mean anything. From new remastered picture and new digital audio to boring meanenless interviews, but what about REAL extras? Like deleted scenes, outtakes, i mean real material that realy interest the viewer, and in this cult film's case, THE FANS! Because this cult classic is a matter of real fanatism, we the fans demand all the spinal tap material that we can get hour hands on! And this special edition brings you all that and more. Not only typical extra written material, like filmographies and bios, here you can find all the audiovisuals that weren`t used, tv trailers, movie trailers, commercials, interviews, and enough deleted scenes and outtakes to make a whole new movie of its own! I mean everything! fake interviews, presentations on tv shows, video clips, goofing-around trailers, a crazy audio commentary by the "band" during the film, you name it... Even the main page is commented by spinal tap!!!! In conclusion, A REAL DEAL, don`t miss this edition. It`s not often to find a real cult classic movie in such a fine presentation loaded with such material. Amazing realy. Of course the digital and audio could have been better, but the movie is so entertainning that you can pass that 
Great movie - there isn't anything I can say that hasn't been said 100 times. 
what can I say, on a scale of 1 thru 10 this movie goes to 11! 
Most people doesn't realize that this band SUCK'S!!!! I AM a "HARD-CORE ROCKER FAN" but please!! Is not because this band doesn't know how to play music or is fictional, is beacause it suck's!! The reason that Spinal Tap suck's is because of their bloopers in live-concert and most of all THEIR STUPID LYRICS!!!!! I mean: "YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, OR MAYBE YOU DON'T!!!!!??????" "LISEN, SHHHHH!! WHAT THE FLOWER PEOPLE SAY AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!?????" "THE CATS MEOW!!!???" "SEX FARM WOMAN!!!???" "BIG BUTTON!!!!??" "I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME EARDRUMS BLEED!!!!????" COME ON! PEOPLE!!!! Try to realize why this movie is sooo funny! BEACUSE ALL THE PEOPLE LIKE A BAND THAT IS PURE GARBAGE!!!!!! But don't get me wrong! I did enjoy this movie(documentary really) because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60's, 70's and early 80's. And their music is LOUD, FAST and HEAVY!!! Adios. 
How to be a part of real Rock History without being a musician, singer, producer or someone in the music business? Answer: Make a movie as this one. Almost every serious Rock fan and rock star must have seen this movie or if they haven't, they had better see it before they go out and give another interview. Believe me, there are bands and performers who still talk and give interviews like Spinal Tap did in this movie. This movie is made for these guys. Like me, if you have watched countless interviews of rockstars, popstars and movie stars you cannot do without this classic. The Lead guitarist was my favourite. I could give him an Oscar for his brilliant performance. If Jimmy Page used a bow on his guitar you must wait and see what the lead guitarist of Spinal Tap does. These guys literally become Gods by the way they poke fun at Rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live. In fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands. One of the most famous lines from the movie apart from "This one goes to 11" is when the band is asked about one of their deceased members for which the band mates tell the interviewer (played by the director Rob Reiner himself) that the bandmate died of choking on vomit but they didn't know whose vomit! Hilarious and highly entertaining you'll love this DVD with tons of goodies which are worth the price of the DVD alone. There is so much extra footage on the DVD that is seems like Spinal Tap 2. The extras are as good as the original movie. I couldn't stop laughing when the band goes to the zoo and near the chimps cage when they are talking their usual ridiculous lines they say things like "'..chimps can't talk but can use computers.." and stuff. You wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this. Neatly packaged even the liner notes are funny. Almost every move made and every line spoken is worth being labelled funny. One of the songs even caught my attention though the lyrics were insane. A classic you cannot afford to miss 
A seering exploration of life behind the glitz and glamour of rock and roll? Not quite, but it is an amusing mock-u-mentry on a fictitious band named Spinal Tap and the trials and tribulations on the concert road for a group long past its glory days. Released in '84 'This Is Spinal Tap' is a cult classic amongst those who are in a band, or have ever been in one. I on the other hand have never possessed any musical talent and therefore I'm not privy to the clever nuances and insightful jokes that populate this film, I can only take the word of those on the inside. Be that as it may, if you, like me, find yourself on the outside looking in give it a chance anyway. There's enough funny material, like the Stonghenge bit, for all of us to enjoy 
I should've bought this movie a long time ago. The price was really great and the shipping was very fast 
greatly funny!!! a must get!!! hillarious!!! wow and a ha ha!!! i recomend this movie to all who love rock and to all who love comedy...and those who love both to 
...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point. John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool. This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz. He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters. A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar. The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile. Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae. Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film. It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film). Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug. It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician. So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts. The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol. Watchable, but barely. The Player covered this terrain so much better. 
Saw this movie on cable and it was so funny to my fiance' and I that I went to Amazon and bought it. I do not think you will be disappointed if you buy it 
Great movie, although it is very similar to get shorty I liked this one better, just because Uma Thurman rock 
Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie. Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it. As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad. How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me. She is not attractive nor can she act. She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit. I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better. His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak. And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so. The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn. Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie. I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping. While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again. Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good. 
The problem with this film is I read the book. I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent. The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example. Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!" But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit. "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made. A few laughs are provided. A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature. Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved. Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½. The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot. Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room. Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug. I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director. Enough said there. My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.' 
Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments. However, the film is a bit uneven. The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record. An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. Andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood. F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it. 
My first time seeing this movie I was in the barbershop. I said to myself, this is a must see movie. I like John Travolta as an actor. I have a few of his films already. This movie is a bit comedy,drama,gangster,and Pulp Fiction. The Rock's character was amusing,who would have thought he would play as a gay bodyguard. I'd recommend adding another good movie to your library. 
All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over. 
Two people made this moving hilarious: Zaboo and Vince Vaughn. Although I'm a huge Travolta fan, these two supporting characters kept me in stitches. Cedric the Entertainer also added to the success of this movie. 
There is a funny thing about certain comedies; they may have been flops and regarded as horrible by many people [critics especially] but you just can't help liking them. Case in point "Vibes." Now I know many people who don't like this film, and that's okay with me. I like it! I found the film funny, and more importantly, it's one of those comedies that are watchable through repeated viewings. You know when a film is enjoyable when you like watching it again and again. I have this DVD, from Japan, however, it is not a very good DVD. It is not widescreen, and the features are pretty horrid. In fact, the VHS cassette is much better to watch. Therefore, when is this film going to be released [Do you hear studios]. I thought Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum were magical in this film. I have written that many comedies are trite, and lose their appeal after awhile, whereas others seem eternal. This is one of those comedies that I really enjoy. It's not the greatest comedy. But I really enjoy watching it. Once again, there are some things that cannot be described about certain films. I have seen comedies people rave about, and I find them stale. Yet, here is a film that is not considered great, and I think it's terrific. That's that beauty of comedy. I really wish the studios would release this on DVD, because the one I own from Japan is not that good. Stick with the VHS if you own it. The picture quality is much clearer. And those who have not seen this film, it was released in 1988, try and get a copy of the VHS if you can. Eschew the DVD import from Japan however, as the transfer is pretty bad. The film deals with Jeff Goldblum as a psychic sent to the Andes in South America in search of a lost person. However, there is more than meets the eye. Cyndi Lauper is an unorthodox psychic [aren't they all?] who also journeys with Goldblum. The film is funny and enjoyable. I highly recommend the film. [I may be a bit biased]. 
It's been a long time since i've seen this movie, but it was cute and funny as well as fantastical. I never thought the Cyndi Lauper / Jeff Goldblum combo would have worked, but their cooky combo made a lovable eccentricity and bond between their characters as well as with Peter Falk. Lots of humor in this movie depsite the subject revolving around two Psychics headed for South America chased by other psychics trying to beat them there. Surprisingly infused in this cooky caper are some short poignant, heart-warming interludes with Peter Falk as well as some neat special effects. Bombed at the box office and did okay on cable, but a much underrated story with its own quirky charm. 
They don't come much more offbeat than this. This is a great gem of a movie. A lot of fun. Great cast and offbeat plot to the max. 
Yes, I know, to most this movie was not good. But, I'm a huge Cyndi Lauper fan, so I LOVED it and have to give it 5 stars. Don't you love how they left it open for a sequel? But I want to know why there is no DVD??? They put EVERY other movie I can think of on DVD, so why not this one? TEEN WITCH is on DVD so why isnt VIBES? and yes, the video for Hole in my Heart (all the way to china) SHOULD be on the DVD! It is a MUST 
Vibes only lasted a few weeks at the box office before Critics tore it to shreds. No one at the time thought a movie starring singer Cindy Lauper could be any good. Despite what the critics thought, Cindy held her own. Jeff Goldblum and Cindy, as well as every other actor really make this film enjoyable to watch, despite its age. Jeff and Cindy are psychics hired by a charming as ever Peter Faulk to use their abilities to find a lost Inca City before another group of baddies do. The City however is not exactly what everyone thinks it is. I dont know why its not on dvd but it should be. Yes, its campy and very '80s but the actors make it believable and actually a joy to watch. A definite lazy Sunday afternoon movie 
Lauper is a sarcastic character coupled with Goldblum's dry humor it was pretty funny. I'm sure most would think it was stupid, however I am drawn to 80's early 90's flicks. It was no Goonies classic, however I'd watch it just as quickly if either were on tv. Lots of laughs for a person with an actual sense of humor who likes to smile. 
This is a very funny movie that went unnoticed by many. I'm also waiting for the DVD because I won't buy any VHS tapes 
This movie is a complete gem, and I don't know what exactly the critics that panned it (I've even read that the closing theme voiced by Lauper was a flop) were thinking. Granted, it is probably funnier if you've had any sort of involvement with psychic phenomena or got swept up in any sort of New Age spirituality, but even if you don't get the "psychic" humor, the script is great, the comedic timing is impeccable, and the cast is completely delightful. (For example, psychic Lauper letting her spirit guide work through her tells one of the bad guys, "Your [dead] mother wants you to let us go, Ingo." Immediately, Falk adds, "And she wants you to give us all your money." This was one of my all-time favorite Peter Falk vehicles, and I thought Lauper was charming and had great on-screen chemistry with Goldblum. Really, what was not to like here 
An excellent movie.....fun and entertaining. A little suspense, great laughs, great music and some beautiful scenery. All done with talented and very funny stars: Peter Falk, Cyndi Lauper, and Jeff Goldblum. Hope it becomes available on DVD SOON 
Where is the DVD? This is an awesome 80's quirky comedy that I enjoy quite a bit, but I refuse to buy VHS. I'm personally a fan of Goldblum's (and this film in particular) and think he paired well with Lauper in this film, but would really like to see this distributed in DVD format. By the other reviews, I'm not the only one; who do we have to complain to, to make this happen? Cheers 
I found this movie to be amazing. You really connected with the characters. This is the type of movie that you either hate it or you love it. I for one loved it. The scene with Lee Grant screaming at the end is a tear jerker. I've seen this movie numberous times and still cry during that scene. I love the closeness he had with his friends and the distance he had with his father. It was very similar to my family and friends. If you like emotional movies, buy it. If your not into the sappy movies, don't buy it. 
Waste of money. Waste of time. Well-known cast. Amateurish direction. Plotless. Politically correct to the point of being stupid. The film's incessant attempts at humor fail. Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film. He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false. It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character. The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant. The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss. Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off. Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments. If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
I saw this one in the movie theatre. Since then, it really made an impression on me. Some think it is depressing (my family, specifically). I enjoyed the acting and the premise behind the plot 
A brilliant, but sad movie about the effects of AIDS, both to the patient, and to the family and friends. Eric Roberts, Gregory Harrison, and the rest of the all-star cast were phenomenal. For those who have lost loved ones and friends to this horrific disease, you will definitely be moved to the point of tears, then laughter, then tears again. I thought this was definitely Oscar material. It is right up there with "Philadelphia" in my book 
this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.  
A wonderful movie. Have a box a tissue ready!! Eric Roberts is incredibl 
This movie is my all time favorite movie. The cast is awesome, you really feel the pain and anguish in Amalia (played by Lee Grant) as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son's life. This movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved. I love the way that Randal Kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless. The movie at times feels a little forced but I can't think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours. 
This has to be one of the most moving films I have seen! The story involves a man infected with HIV (back in the early days), who decides to end his life when he is diagnosed with AIDS. The character decides to say goodbye to all the special people in his life by throwing a party. This movie will make you laugh and cry at several points throught. As everyone has said, watch it with someone and have lots of kleenex handy 
This movie will make you laugh and cry with a who's who of hollywood. The music alone will move you to the kleenex box. If you have lost someone to aids, this movie will touch you deeply. I was told not to watch this movie alone. Watch it with someone to hug. How right they were. Bronson Pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have. Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples I know. Bravo! Get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect 
"El-Hazard: The Magnificent World" is an anime very much in the "Tenchi Muyo!" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in "El-Hazard" aren't developed as deeply as the "Tenchi" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, "El-Hazard" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, "El-Hazard" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved! The dub is also pretty darn good, though it tends to get overly shouty, especially in the segments centering on Jinnai. Can't the guy ever just speak in a normal tone? "El-Hazard" is hardly the type of show that will change your life, but if you like "Tenchi" or other anime in this vein, this box set is probably a good bet. (The set actually contains two separate shows: the original "El-Hazard" OAV and its 4-episode sequel "El-Hazard 2." The sequel is an inconsequential side story that unfortunately doesn't really add any value.) 
I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard "The magnificent world". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon). Well, I have to say that the bad reviews are wrong. This DVD series was totally awesome (although I admit it started a bit slow). I promise the more you keep watching, the better it gets. The plot is highly intelligent (involving dimensional and time travel) and the characters are very interesting (with distinctive special powers). Some say the humor in El Hazard is juvenile (but I would argue no more juvenile then southpark), and seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile? Some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant (because many episodes involve a doomsday device), to which I respond "Do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star"? no, ofcourse not. yes this DVD set lacks some extras, but I think Pioneer did a great job. The DVD menu presentation is beautiful, and the box is very elegant too. Hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on Ebay (beware of bootlegs). It's very hard to find a good authentic set. The sequel "alternative world" which I just ordered, individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart. For my fellow anime comedy fans, I also reccomend "Niea under 7" and "His and Her Circumstances". animation=5 plot=4 music=4 characters=5 comedy=4 Total= 4.4 Star 
ive seen alot of anime, but el hazard has to be one of the best. my only regret is that it was so good that it ended too soon. if ur looking for something with humor action and even some romance, i highly recomend el hazard 
I started out by watching the The Wanderers firts and was sort of disappointed. But I still but the the OAV series. I completely and utterly love it. It kind of reminded me of Tenchi, but it is completly different too. This is definately much better than the TV series so if you want to watch the El Hazard series be sure to start by watching the OAV first you won't regret it 
To speak of the Spanish Civil War is extremely difficult today. To speak of it from an English point of view is even more impossible. Yet Ken Loach manages to keep his tone and our interest totally measured and awake from beginning to end. Never he lets us go down into forgetting that we are speaking of one essential defeat of the revolutionary movement in the world in the late 1930s when confronted to the frontal violence from Hitler and Mussolini. And he does remind us of the fact that the Soviet Union never helped the Republicans and that Stalin both refused to hear the call and manipulated the communist party in Spain into dividing the republican movement in order to try and take the control of it all. The point is to wonder whether Stalin and the communist party of Spain knew that it would mean defeat for the republicans, and hence did they want that defeat ? The accusation, even in the form of a question, is crystal clear. Stalin's motivation on the other hand is extremely unclear and Ken Loach prefers not to enter any speculation on the subject. The conclusion is there to be heard and understood and it was a catastrophe in Spain, in Europe and in the world, a catastrophe that never had had and never has had any equivalent in history. But is Stalin the only culprit ? No one can say for sure, and quite a few elements point in a more all-inclusive explanation without entering details : Stalin refused weapons and support, the west refused weapons and support, Hitler and Mussolinin sent their bombers and ammunitions, be it only to test them on a real battlefield. The great merit of Ken Loach's film is that seventy years (sixty years whe the film was shot) or so after the events, the wound is still open, the question has not yet been answered and the dramatic consequences are still there to be assessed and regretted. Our modern world of liberal frenzy is the direct child of what happened in France and Spain, Germany and Italy, England and the Soviet Union seventy years ago. And we are still on the same line of division and antagonism, of change without risk and non-change to avoid any risk, in a world that is gaping and howling for change while hoping this unstoppable change will not put the whole fragile balance of reality in danger. And there is no guarantee against this risk. That's what to be poor is all about today : to be haunted by fear in front of the risk the change we desire may mean. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne 
In 1936, unemployed working class labourer, Dave Carr (Ian Hart) attends a Communist meeting in Liverpool and is recruited to fight the Fascists in Spain. He heads out with little idea where he is going, but with his Communist party card in hand, he soon meets up with a loosely banded detachment of the POUM militia group. The POUM organisation was a Marxist Communist union that formed an alliance with FAI/CNT Spanish Anarchists with the common goal of defeating renegade fascist general Franco. The militia live in rough camps, lack weapons, and engage in a type of trench warfare with the fascists. Dave's adventures include the liberation of a fascist-held village, and a slow tender romance that simmers with fellow militia member, Blanca (Rosana Pastor). Dave's disillusionment sets in when the POUM militias come under Stalinist control. With Stalin supporting the Communist Party of Spain, the militias are ordered to accept new rules. The women--who've fought alongside the men--are ordered to become either nurses or cooks. In spite of the fact that new weapons are promised, nothing appears. The militia members are divided by conflicting opinions--some seeing that the militia is now effectively de-fanged, join the Stalinist International Brigade, but other members stay faithful to the militia alliance. "Land and Freedom" documents Stalin's betrayal of the POUM organization and their allies the Anarchists--soon POUM and the Anarchists (who've made some significant military advances) are under attack by the Stalinists and the Republican army. The Stalinists shut down the POUM newspapers and arrest some of their leaders. Instead of fighting the fascists, the parties who are supposed to be allied against Franco, are fighting each other. It's the old divide and conquer strategy--but this time the Stalinists effectively divide the Anarchists and the Marxists and squash them--betraying the revolution, and betraying Spain. The film makes it quite clear that Marxism is not the same thing as Stalinism, and that the Spanish Civil War was a war within a war. There's one great scene when Dave--fighting with the International Brigade-is holed up on one side of the street shooting at a group of Anarchists barricaded on the other side of the street. Insults are shouted from each side and then Dave exchanges comments with a British fighter from Manchester. They ask each other what they are doing there, and each man answers "dunno." It is this event that causes Dave to cease fighting with the International Brigade and return to the militia. "Land and Freedom" is first and foremost a political film--the romance between Dave and Blanca is never forced or even central to the plot. The era portrayed by the film is a complicated subject, and this Ken Loach film does an incredible job of putting large political ideas into an understandable format for the average viewer. One scene, for example, portrays the arguments that take place between villagers following the village's liberation from the fascists. Some of the villagers wish to divide up the land immediately and begin collectivism (one of the goals of the newly elected democratic government that Franco intended to squash). The argument whether or not to begin collectivism illustrates the different arguments that the villagers have on the subject, and this scene also includes information regarding England and France's refusal to sell weapons to the Spanish republic--even though it was a well-known fact that Franco was receiving support from Germany and Italy. Dave is a marvelous character--an everyman who "leaves Liverpool with a daft romantic idea" that's trammeled by political realities. Ian Hart's low-key acting style is perfect for this role. We know that Dave's disillusionment is complete when he rips up his Communist party card. Ultimately--the film is an avowal of Socialism and the ongoing struggles of the working classes. "Land and Freedom" is an important political film, and anyone even remotely interested should dig out a copy of this buried film. It's informative, but it's also an excellent, excellent film. Well done, Ken Loach--displacedhuma 
I had heard about this film by director Ken Loach a few years before getting to see it, and I can't emphasize how impressive the film is - it not only has realistic war drama, but examines and expresses the complexities of one of the greatest problems in the 20th century - the struggle of working class people for some kind of system other than capitalism that was not tainted with the authoritarianism and anti-humanism of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin's USSR or Mao's mainland China. Regardless of the downplaying by right-wing "business as usual" extremists like Angel Garralda Ortega (who wrote a review that attacked this movie below), there really was (and still is) a libertarian communist movement - made up of anarchists - that was based on the idea of worker's shrugging bosses and landlords off their back - not forcibly banning exploitation with the use of the state and it's laws, but rather the libertarian idea of not letting oneself be exploited, and not exploiting others - abandoning the essence of capitalism in an anti-authoritarian manner. Also, Mr. Ortega has it wrong - the sporadic killings from the Republican side at the opening of the Spanish Civil War only amounted to some 3 or 4 thousand deaths of Fascist supporting landlords and Spanish catholic church officials who had orders to kill the libertarians and republicans on sight. The anarchist CNT organization opposed such vigilantism and punished those individuals that did it. Contrast this with the hundreds of thousands to millions of tortured and executed republicans, libertarians, liberals, workers, small businessmen, progressive Catholics, protestants, and so on who opposed Franco after the civil war's end in 1939. Also, the POUM was not trotskyist. It was an independent socialist organization that had broken from Trotsky, and it's leading figure, Andrs Nin, was executed by Stalinists - like so many militia fighters such as anarchist Camillo Berneri. In another Amazon review, Jonas Liljestrm of Gothenburg, Sweden has explained the basic point I am making better than I could: "Historians who attempt to rehabilitate Franco's reputation often tend to overlook the fact that whereas the Republicans generally tried to avoid unnecessary acts of brutality during the war, the Nationalists did exactly the opposite. Mass killings, rapes, looting and wanton destruction were commonplace as they terrorised the civilians in the newly conquered areas, trying to discourage them from putting up a resistance. The repression of political opponents continued virtually throughout the duration of the Franco regime. The fact that Franco fought communism is no reason to glorify him. After all, Hitler did the same, but the homicidal aspects of his politics are so blatantly obvious that it would be quite impossible to depict him as anything resembling a heroic figure. In my opinion, defending Franco is as outrageous from an ethical point of view as it would be to defend Hitler, Mussolini or Stalin." But I digress... this film accurately shows how there was a popular libertarian socialist revolution in Madrid and Barcelona in Spain in 1936 that was crushed by Stalinists a year later, leading to the inevitable disheartenment and loss of the civil war by those who wanted to preserve liberty and democracy. The actors in this film are likely to be unfamiliar to US viewers, but I know that the lead, Ian Hart, was later in the first Harry Potter film. Be sure to also see the magnificent Spanish Civil War film "Libertarias" directed by Vicente Aranda. It's focus is more squarely on the anarchist CNT, instead of the independent Marxist POUM. Artificial Eye is releasing a region 2 DVD of this film, available from the UK version of Amazon. I very strongly recommend this excellent drama as one of the best ways to learn about the Spanish Civil War 
I really enjoy this movie..it makes me laugh, a lot! I highly recommend it. Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow make a good team 
The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete 
This is one of my Favs of the 80s. Not the best story line, or the best jokes, but parts of this movie really make me laugh. Basically two guys are spending a weekend in a resort doing nothing but trying to get laid, but in the process are getting nothing but trouble. Just one of my favorites, one of those 80s classics. May not live up to what some people expect from a movie anymore, but for it's time, it was funny up there with Animal House,The Nerds, and Porkys. Buy it only if you are a fan of 80s flicks as mentioned above and can just relax 
This movie is adorable and very funny !!! One of the earlier classic "slapstick" comedies. It is fun to see Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow when they were very young. Hector Elizondo is hilarious as a jewel thief who is also very obsessed with how his hair looks. My mom, sister and I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out on DVD. This movie is right up there with "White Chicks" in comic escapades. A true "must have" for the avid collector of classic "slapstick" comedies from the 1980's !! 
The DVD is scheduled for release on 06/27/2006. Keep an eye out for it 
I have searched the net high and low for this movie on DVD, I can't understand why it isn't available.....pleeeeeeeeeeese someone put it on DV 
I admit that I'm a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, but this wasn't anywhere near one of his best. He IS adorable in the movie, but the plot is extremely corny, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud. Guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini-sporting girls, but not much else. Although there are a few remotely funny parts, it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is. But then again, it was worth it to watch Johnny 
OK, for Johnny Depp fans everywhere, I request a DVD version of this movie. It's a great movie and it definately speaks for itself...a must see 
Love story meets dark comedy. Cameron Diaz said it best in "There's Something About Mary" - Harold and Maude is the greatest love story of all time. The story is great, the humor priceless, and the soundtrack is fabulous 
After watching this movie one Friday night I immediately watched it again. "Did I just see that" was my initial reaction. A fantastic film that sticks with you for weeks. Initially rented from a local blockbuster before purchasing it via Amazon, I watched it over 6 times before returning it back. I loved the Cat Stevens soundtrack and it makes me sad that there is no Harold and Maude soundtrack that has all of the songs especially " Tea for the Tillerman". You appreciate the brilliant directing and although it has been considered "creepy" it is never truly unsettling, but rather it makes you examine how you add value to life and for myself created ways to be Maude-a-licous! 
On the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as "niche" as you can get, but don't overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you'll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a "coming of age" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours 
Prior to VHS or DVD - back in 1971-75 - when movie theaters (remember those, the ones where it was only $1 for two films and a short and the films were shown in BIG theaters - so what if the sound wasn't Dolby or DTS - films were still films not; just 1 of 10 stock plots enhanced by computer special effects. Well, this film was so absolutely brilliant and profound, innocent and ageless that I saw it every time it was advertised "in the newspaper" - in the movie section. I believe I lost count at around 75 - now with the DVD in my closet it just is not watched as mcuh but remains for times when it is necessary to remember that people are really alive and giving souls - whether they represent the protagonist or antagonist. "Give me an "L"; give me an "I"; give me a "V"; give me an "E"; L I V E, live! Else you've got nothin' to talk about in the locker room." A hint to the seeing of this work of art -"allow no preconceptions of what it will be or what it is, just let it be - observe without judgement and you will KNOW 
This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all. The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with "Foul Play" and "Nine to Five") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone. Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in "The Graduate", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included 
People who watch this movie either love it or hate it. 
Harold and Maude is simply the most joyful movie I have ever seen. Not only is it laugh-out-loud funny, it is touching and moving and odd. If you haven't seen it in a while ... see it again 
I love this movie so much. I first heard about it while listening to a Henry Rollins spoken word performance (I know so random)when I was in my teens. I went out and rented it right away, and I have watched it about 100 times since then. I tried to get a copy for years without realizing I could just order it on Amazon. It's such a sweet touching story. It's a bit off the wall, but that's of course what I love about it 
"Harold and Maude" is one of those movies that's hard to categorize. It's a black comedy, an offbeat romance, and a little morality play all in one. There are some really hilarious scenes - my favorite is the part where H outwit Harold's uncle, a crazed militarist - and also some touching scenes between the two protagonists. I can't quite give this movie five stars, however, for several reasons. First, the production quality is mediocre at best. Second, while Maude's antics are amusing at a distance, she's not really all that loveable. A lot of her "advice" seems too much like warmed-over late 60s "do what feels good" drivel; apparently it's OK to steal cars if you're 79 years old. The Cat Stevens songs are often intrusive and annoying . And finally, the scene with H in bed, presumably after having sex, is just ... creepy 
I saw this movie as a child and it simply stole my breath away! This is from the age of great movie making in Hollywood! Black and white makes it even more dynamic! Considering that the major actors are NOT really Chinese,but made Chinese by clever makeup, it is even more amazing. They make their characters come alive and REAL! The story of a poor farmer living with his father, the story takes you from his wedding to a slave to his rise as a rich Landlord. The journey is the thing! The slave he marries is meek on the outside, but strong inside. She even goes out DURING LABOR to help save their wheat crop from the coming hailstorm! And it is done with REALITY although for its time, the special effects are amazing and devestating. A famine comes and they must kill and eat their beloved ox. It is the WOMAN who can only kill their beloved friend so they can survive. When someone offers pitance for their land, the woman kills her newborn child so they can keep the land and go to the city for a while to survive. It is the woman who finds a bag of jewels that propels them to a life of riches. There is a lot of happiness, heartache and truth in this movie. It will NOT disappoint. OUTSTANDING performances!! 
There were only Chinese in the background. Just like in Memoirs of a Geisha (the actresses - or at least the main ones where Chinese instead of Japanese) the actors and actresses in The Good Earth where not Chinese either. I certainly cried foul when in Memoirs of a Geisha Chinese actresses where asked to play Japanese roles. The actresses in Memoirs of a Geisha did not pull it off then and The Good Earth's stars Paul Muni and Luise Rainer did not pull it off either - sorry. Now, would the role of O-Lan have been better played by Anna May Wong is arguable. As a Chinese American - she was removed from here Chinese ethnic roots - or was she. Nevertheless, the point is there were only Chinese people in the background. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung, a peasant Chinese farmer. Conversely, Luise Rainer is O-Lan, his once slave now wife. This cinematic adaptation of the Pearl Buck novel (which is arguably the source of the problem) has Wang Lung and O-Lan trying to make their way in what is an epic battle against poverty, nature, and a whole host of other impediments - like their own personalities. Starting from scratch and building their land holdings up from nothing, then as the famine hit, losing everything. The family moves south only to slum it on the streets of the city. O-Lan - the perennial luck bringer finds a cache of jewels during a riot (in which she was almost killed herself), she and Wang Lung become the landlords once again. Wang Lung sets up a stereotype of the disloyal Chinese fellow who hurts his wife deeply - one who brought all the luck by engaging in a second, younger wife. To get biblical, our protagonists - using the skills gained by their young son - battle against a plague of locusts and win! Predictably (and it is all over the place) there is a tone of inexcusable jingoism in the movie. The Good Earth more a reflection of how we saw Chinese rather than an authentic rendition of the Chinese themselves. Muni and Rainer (who won an Oscar for this role) are miscast for the roles, and particularly the minor characters (many of whom are also played by Non-Chinese) do a terrible job of playing Chinese - they are all in caricature. One could only give kudos to a movie like this if (1) One thought this was a wonderful rendition of what we think Chinese are, and (2) One has never been to China. It is Orientalism and should be seen as such. Miguel Llor 
A B/W Film Classic. Excellent story and performances from all the stars, perhaps the acting style is a little dated. A very god qulaity transfer to DVD except for one scene that is a little grainy. I will watch this film again and again 
I read the book back in high school and thought it was amazing! I've always wanted to watch the movie and finally got it on DVD a week ago. I never liked black and white movies but this movie was excellent because the pictures were very clear and the sound was excellent. My only objection is that the movie left out lots of details that's in the book. But thumbs up anyway! Highly recommended 
I love this film. It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing. I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used. I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches. In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture. I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves. I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print . One of the worst I've ever seen 
This movie exemplifies what was good and what was bad about Hollywood in the 1930's. The good part was that they could take a major work of contemporary literature and convert it into a major motion picture. The good was that they could create special effects like the swarm of locusts attacking the fields. The good was that they could adhere to a code of standards that enabled them to suggest sexuality without showing it. The good was that they could make a moral statement without hitting us over the head with it. The bad was the fact that they used Caucasian actors to play the leading Oriental roles. Paul Muni never came across as an Oriental of any nationality and no amount of make-up was going to make it happen. Luise Rainer came off fairly believable but to have Uncle Henry from "The Wizard of OZ" playing the venerable father was too much. The problem that Hollywood had for years (and, to an extent, even today) was that they couldn't seem to accept non-Caucasians in leading roles. Orson Welles plays Othello, Peter Lorre plays Mr. Motto, Anthony Quinn plays an Eskimo in "The Savage Innocents", Ricardo Montalban plays a Native American (and, in a bizarre twist, so does Woody Strode), Ben Kingsley plays Gandhi, and on and on and on. I realize that the attitude is that a big name helps sell the movie but why not let an Oriental play an Oriental, a Native American play a Native American. I don't think it was a lack of talent. I suspect it was a lack of interest. Having made those points, I would conclude by suggesting that "The Good Earth" is about 20-30 minutes too long but it is otherwise a very good picture. I believe that Luise Rainer was awarded the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Olin and I came away impressed that the award was well earned. 
"The Good Earth" must be considered a "milestone movie." As yet, there is no DVD but one packed with out-takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome. There was no Oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939; otherwise, "The Good Earth" would have 'taken home' that award! The lovely Luise Ranier did win "Best Actress" award. The 1937 movie was based on Pearl Buck's novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Interest in "The Good Earth" was revived in Fall 2004 when it was selected for "Oprah's Book Club". Perhaps women's rights advocates should also give it a boost? The story is about China in the 1900s. A simple farmer, Wang Lung, is 'given' (by his father) the slave O-Lan, for his bride. I do not remember much from childhood about this film, but I definitely do not recall Paul Muni having such a mouthful of teeth! (special effecrs?!) Luise Ranier had won an Oscar the previous year for her role in the "Ziegfield Follies" -- what a contrast! Here she is the completely docile, loyal wife; as someone wrote, she was bound to her husband in "eternal servitude." And her devotion was betrayed. Partly through the machinations of "Uncle". At every time of crisis in the story along comes (GROAN!) the crafty, manipulatve uncle (Walter Connolly) who whines wheedles - - inserting humor (?) into the script and at the same time destroying family amity. From the Internet Movie Database are the prophetic words of former slave O-Lan: "When I go back in that house, it will be with my son in my arms. I'll have a red coat on him... and red flower trousers... and a hat with a gilded Buddha and tiger-faced shoes, and I'll go into the kitchen where I spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe, and I'll show myself and my son to all of them." (Smiles, contented) Wang Lung: "Well... Now, I... I haven't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house." Isn't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago? I found the quality of framed camera shots surprising the production of many scenes quite amazing. READ Susan Wong's wonderfully perceptive review on amazon.com. Today's movie-goers don't seem to care about "true life" documentation in films, but animation couldn't convince as the 1930s true-life locusts do! That tired word "awesome" truly fits this vintage film: the choking drought famine, the beautiful 'condensed' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm, and the terrifying scenes of revolutionary uprisings. REVIEWER mcHAIKU HAILS THIS FILM, and others that made an impact on my childhood! 
Very rarely in my life have I come across a movie that makes me cry. All you would have to do is watch the last 10 minutes of this movie to understand what I'm saying. However, you should see the entire movie - what perfection. It has comedy, drama, and great acting on all parts. Tyrone Power (my favorite actor) gives a grade A performance. Never will you find him as loveable, or as dignified than as Martin Maher, Jr. I find it hard to believe that John Ford (the director) originally wanted John Wayne for this movie. Not to nock Wayne, but Power can convey sensitivity better. As a side note, John Wayne's son Patrick appears in the movie. Maureen O'Hara, lovely as ever, gets back to her Irish roots in this film, and it makes for a point-perfect characterisation from the Queen of Technicolor. It isn't any wonder John Ford loved her as an actress. She's one of the best. The movie spans 50 years at West Point Military Academy, and the life of Martin Maher and the people's lives he touched. It is a great American story. Definitely, worth every bit of the two hours and seventeen minute running time. I love this movie, and if you read this you really should be watching the movie. Seriously, it made me cry!! 
The movie overall is really a great story; the quality of the DVD is what really is what I find as poor quality. It's almost as though some one copied it using a video camera recorder. I already own a copy of the VHS tape and it is a far better version of the film. The actors are classics. I can only say good things about Maureen O'Hara and Tyrone Powers. Ward Bond also. There were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention; still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of Americana that deserves remembering. 
I first saw this movie at our local in the late 50`s here in the U.K. The Memory of Marty Maher never left.. Looking through Amazon one evening i noticed it was available. Well done it arrived in 6 days. Some things you order locally take longer than that.After all these years since i last saw it it`s still a great movie and still brings a tear to the eye. Tyrone Power was perfect, sadly nearing the end of his life as Marty Maher. Nothing against John Wayne who i understand was the first choice but this was`nt his part. Maureen o Hara is wonderful. Ward Bond as "That blackhearted master of the sword" as Marty calls him and Donald Crisp as Marty snr. Its a long movie covering 50 years but never you loose interest. Its perfect. John Ford wanted to be remembered as the man who made westerns. Well he made other great movie`s as well. In my opinion this is an equal to The Quiet Man....The Long Gray Line. The best Ford without John Wayne 
This is a good old fashioned film similar to the English film 'Goodbye Mr Chips'. It has lots of old fashioned values and contains humour, pathos, passion and sentimentality which will tug at the heart strings!!! I defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat or a tear in the eye when the long awaited Marr baby dies shortly after birth, or when James 'Red' Sandstrom Jr. comes to vist Marty at Christmas with his mother. I just love the whole tone of the film - the director has got the atmosphere just right. A real cracker of a film lacking in any real violence or nastiness I am pleased to say. It is a film I can watch again and again. Even my husband, normally quite reticent with such films, was impressed. That to me was praise indeed 
Highly enjoyable tale of the life of Marty Maher, the Irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become West Point's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years. Despite personal tragedies, and through two World Wars, Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers' academy, including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage, Irish accent intact all the way. The scenery and West Point pageantry is fun to watch (although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio -- but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the Military Academy). Interestingly, there's not really all that much football in this film -- there's a little, but it's mainly the story of Maher and his family, and the young men he came to love like his own sons. With the flame-haired Maureen O'Hara as Maher's Irish wife Mary, giving a radiant performance. Sentimental in that '50s way, of course, but the legendary director John Ford (working with a cast made up of many of his favorites) always puts a bite behind the sweetness 
I truly enjoyed this movie. I found it moving, funny, and above all, beautiful. This is one of those movies that leaves me feeling something amazing for hours after it has ended. Some of these scenes were absolutely breathtaking - in particular towards the end. LOVED IT 
The traveling plot seemed like a take-off of 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles' - traveling from NY to Savannah vs traveling from Chicago to NY. Same sequence: airplane delays, then train occurrence, then bus, then jalopy-type car. But, since I totally enjoyed the Steve Martin movie, I also enjoyed 'Forces of Nature'. The writer even threw in some weather and fire, same as 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles'. Because of the similarities, I rated it four stars instead of five. I thought the movie was cute and I like both Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. I saw the movie as being typical of infatuation with a good-looking person to whom we've been thrown together with for a brief unlikely encounter and of indecisiveness prior to the marrage ceremony , but Ben was, indeed, committed to his fiance and to his future, which was a positive attribute on his behalf. Unlike some other reviewers who stated commitment was void, I felt it was very much stated in this movie, in spite of other's around them having their own relationships fall apart. Sarah's life was to be her son and her relationship with him - to build it up after some years of absence. The movie ended correctly. Everyone got what they wanted. Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'. 
Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part. I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them? Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC. I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up? And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted? What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending. It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience. I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that. I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other. The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen. RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all. Huh? He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back. This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after? Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously? It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway. It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after! It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
Ben affleck is one of my best actors, and so is sandra bullock. I really enjoyed this film,it was kind of funny on the aeroplane at the begginning of the film. The plane goes all wonky due to a bird flying into the fan of the plane. Ben hits sandra on the head with a laptop and it is so funny. It is quite unusual to other films and that was why i liked it really. HALF ROMANTIC AND BRILLLLLLLL FILM 
Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the "class divide". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail? The problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves. There's very little "energy" at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic. Molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural Kentucky. When her stepfather begins fondling her, and her mother does little to help, Molly tries for the only escape she can find - marrying the older bad-man-in-town, Viggo Mortensen. She claims she never slept with Viggo - only used him for escape. Then Viggo's father began fondling her, and now she wants out of this house as well. To get momentary relief from her homelife, she hangs out at a friend's home, which is a 24 hour party. Here she runs into Andrew. Andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high-class, wealthy girlfriend. The girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns, having children and living the perfect life. Andrew goes with the flow until he sees Molly - and is instantly in lust. Molly leads him to believe she's 20, single, and interested in him. It takes maybe 3 days before he's sleeping with her. To his credit, he does tell his fiancee promptly, and breaks off the engagement. You'd think everything was wonderful now, right? However, Andrew learns from friends about Molly's lies. He decides to keep seeing her anyway. However, he doesn't want to introduce her to his family, and has no intention of marrying her. He says he loves her - but his feelings seem to be more related to sex. At one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off. There's a telling scene near the end when Andrew thinks Molly has been publicly stripped by her husband. Andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with Viggo. Andrew is deliberately rude - laughing at Viggo's artwork and putting him down. But it's Viggo who is the calm one here. When Molly shows up, Viggo points out that Molly's been doing all this lying and scheming so that Andrew would be a Knight in Shining Armor and ride off with her. He asks Andrew - if you're saying I'm not good enough for her - it seems that you think you're too good for her, right? Andrew finds himself agreeing - that he won't take on Molly himself. He wants to get Molly away from Viggo, but then is going to abandon her to her own means. How could he figure that Molly would be better off with nobody at all, vs with Viggo? Fast forward to a year later, and Molly has in fact found herself a "wealthy college boy" to take care of her and is taking classes again. She's happy, and Andrew is sad. I suppose you have to give them credit for a not-typical Hollywood ending to the story. The landscapes are often gorgeous, and the various details of high class, low class, city, country are all played nicely against each other. So the problem really comes down to the main actors. Molly and Andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth. You really get a sense of shallowness when you're watching this movie. Andrew has an entire life including a long-term romance, that he's set in. In just 3 days he's thrown it all away for Molly - but you never get any real sense that he cares about her. Molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life - including seducing and lying to Andrew in order to convince him to rescue her - but she never seems to care much either. Intriguingly, only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie. One is Ben Stiller, Andrew's best friend. It's ironic because Ben's character IS shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him. Even so, Ben really seems authentic as someone who isn't used to having to worry about others - but who really does try his best, many times, to get Andrew to wake up to reality. The other is Viggo Mortensen. You only glimpse Viggo once until the end of the movie - he's just referred to as a "rough guy" who has done many bad things. When you actually encounter Viggo (after Andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him) you're prepared for the worst. However, Viggo is very patient, very well spoken, and quite intelligent in his commentary. He doesn't thrash Andrew for sleeping with his wife. Instead, he lays out the situation and makes both Andrew and Molly face their failings. Molly deliberately lied and used Andrew as a tool of getting a better life. Andrew, for his part, knew he'd never actually rescue Molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her. Some have said this is the worst movie ever. Many sections of it can be very painful to watch. However, I do find glimmers of meaning - especially in the ending discussion with Viggo. Even there, though, you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for Andrew and Molly. Instead, both seem to think, "Yeah, I guess that's true. Oh well, see ya." I don't mind gloomy movies at all - in fact I really appreciate them sometimes. However, if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting, it just makes the whole experience fall flat. 
All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid ( underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you! 
First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New York", but that is a different review. No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak. More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I II). Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection. 
I love this movie. Admittedly, it looks better after all these years than it probably did back in '88. The cinematography is great, Molly Ringwald looks great, and it has a dark and peculiar charm all it's own. I was never into the Brat Pack movies, but this interesting failure came out at the tail end of the Brat Pack era, and as such perfectly captures a moment 
This is seriously the worst movie ever. The last time I saw it was in the theater, and I still can't get over how bad it was. In fact, it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy.... We didn't speak for six months after we saw it together! I too wish I could give it no stars.... And obviously people aren't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002! I can't believe you can even buy it on DVD 
This is an extremely dry anime. The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor. Not so for the anime. The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking. These really make the movie crawl. One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism. Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that. Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story. Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it 
an anime must have. an introduction to an incredible movie series. It started the ghost in the shell stand alone complex. 
This one still can't be beat for its quality story, anime, sound, action. The story might be a bit complicated for simpletons but what can you do. If your an Adult looking for a Full length Action oriented Anime Feature with a Great story with no kiddy factor you found the best 
Let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime. The plot is basically a cybernetic government agent, Major Motoko Kusanagi, who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called "The Puppet Master". From start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline. I think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough. There is a lot of violence and some language. Also, some slight nudity, but very non-sexual. Overall, I think this is one of the best anime ever 
This is an incredibly conceived animation. I'm intirgued by how it has been dubbed into english, there are lots of blank spaces in the dialogue and stillness in the image that I'm guessing might come from a more involved Japanese original. The effect is that sometimes the pace looses dynamism, All in all though its an astounding vision and what really mkes it is the depth of the surround sound track, alongside some really great drawing of course 
In Mamoru Oshii's outstanding Ghost in the Shell (1995), the director/writer gave himself little time, at less than 90 minutes, to explore the many questions he raised in that script. With his long-awaited sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, he succeeds in answering many of these questions whilst at the same time giving us many more to ponder, in a film that, though flawed, deserves a 5 star rating. Rather like a Disney animation, the film can be viewed on more than one level by more than one audience. On the surface it is a sumptuously-animated film in which a fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds; robots are murdering humans, and a crime specialist is brought in to solve the case. Period. We have already seen equivalent plots in films such as Blade Runner or I, Robot and this film has nothing new to add to the basic idea. However Oshii's world is far more disturbing and complex below the surface. He subverts the ending of the film which, could be taken as a triumph of good over evil. However, when distinctions between robot and human become blurred the central notions of good and evil in the film fall down. He pulls other tricks to undermine our assumptions about humanity; at one point the main cop character puts a coat over a robot to hide its nakedness; another time a robotic character philosophises over the meaning of existence, whilst chain-smoking. It is in the director's treatment of the paradox of what it means to be human that the film's value lies, not the superficial plot. Characterisation is a little scimpy (with the notable exception of the depiction of Oshii's own basset hound, which is drawn with clear devotion) but visually the film is stunning. Oshii is one of the few directors able to practice the delicate art of inactivity on screen. He is not scared to abandon the plot for minutes on end to luxuriate in, for example, an extended arial shot of a city, or to dwell on a completely motionless face whilst we register its owner's emotional state, or to allow his main characters, motionless on the screen for what seems like ages, to quote western philosophical and religious texts. None of these scenes moves the plot forwards and yet the film would be immeasurably poorer without them. Too many sequels to outstanding films try to provide glib answers to the issues raised in the original and most fail by this approach; examples such as 2010 and Matrix Reloaded spring to mind. With this film Oshii has avoided this pitfall and given us a rare sequal, that takes the theme of the original and finds something fresh to say. In summary, the film deserves a 5 star rating, but I think that it falls short of greatness. 
This is one of the best anime's of all-time, not only for the animation, but for all the layers of psychology in the story. Sometimes it's hard to know what's going on, but that's part of the amazing atmosphere. Plus, the whole idea of The Puppet Master has to be one of the all-time great concepts for a villain. The notion of a hacker using you and not only wiping out your real memories, but also creating false ones really plays out in a terrifying way in this movie. The music is also killer, and the English dub is much better than is typical for Anime from the nineties. If you're into anime, this is a must-have. 
As an anie fan, i know that a lot of us like anime cause of the attention japanese animators put on their work but believe me, the attention on the detail in this anime is just incredible. One of the best (if not the best) anime outside there 
Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way. There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted. The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's. The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is. In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex 
This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell. 
This movie could've been something, had they gotten some real actors, a script and a director. Well, they didn't, and this movie is an embarassment to mankind 
This is a really great prison film that truly shows what really goes on inside those dark prison walls across the US. The casting and storyline made the film. We were lucky to recruit incredible Eric Roberts,Martin Cove,Matthew Ansara and introducing our Producer, Tommy Lee Thomas who stars and of course, moi as "Jeanette" co-starring with Eric Roberts who plays Officer Hopkins. Definitely rent, buy and let it sweep you off into the world of action and intrigue........... 
On its own terms, this movie is a winner. Why is it that totally true to history or not, actors today cannot be this believable. The performances are universally convincing. Made in 1985, why is it that everyone in this movie put their heart into their performance, and thus I was mesmerized and delighted. When you shed a tear for these young people caught up in the tragedy of political manipulation, it will be no more than the tears of these young actors, so convincing and so deeply rendered. How I wish I could own twenty films like this one! 
I can remeber being a little over eight years old the first time I saw this movie. While I didn't understand it then, I found that the music and the scenery was breath taking. Seeing this movie years later along with other great's such as Young Bess and Mary Queen of Scots, Helena Carter's and Cary Elwes performance's are right up there with such great names as Stuart Granger and Jean Simmons. I would recommend this movie if you like period piece movies, but like I said, don't take into account that the history is a little jumbled, just enjoy it for the tragic history that is burried underneath the plot. 
I own this film on VHS and it's one of the jewels of my collection. I've been a Tudor fan and a Lady Jane Grey fan ever since I watched "The Six Wives of Henry VIII" on CBS in the summer of 1971. I first saw "Lady Jane" in 1986 in the theater and never forgot it. Yes, the movie's not accurate in its depiction of Jane Grey and Guilford Dudley, but I was so happy to finally see a movie about her that it didn't bother me, and the couple's ultimate fate was devastating; it resonated deeply with me. I loved the film then and I love it now (especially with Patrick Stewart in a supporting role as Jane's father, Duke Henry Grey) 
Lady Jane Grey, niece to Henry VIII, was appointed to the throne due to the corrupt machinations of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. Her cousin, King Edward VI of England was a mere boy of 15 when he deeded the throne to her by deeming his sisters bastards (and thus severing the throne from the Catholic side of the family and ensuring that Henry's reformation would continue). Mary, Edward's sister, wouldn't sit still for this and she sought to overtake the throne upon Edward's death. Northumberland led the troops in an ill fated attempt to repel Mary. She regained the throne after only 9 days of rule by her cousin Jane Grey and her young husband, Guilford Dudley (an arranged marriage at the bequest of Northumberland and Jane's parents). Jane Grey and Guilford were subsequently executed for treason and heresy. All of these points come out in the film "Lady Jane". However, the film is geared to being a romance and as such, the historical facts get a bit muddied along the way. The acting is quite fine - indeed. Helena Bonham Carter, as Jane Grey, kicked off her "costume drama" career with this film. Cary Elwes, with only a couple of films under his belt (Another Country), as Guilford, strikes a handsome, roguish pose and delivers a finely controlled and believable performance. The rest of the cast is made up of fine British actors who are more than capable of carrying their own weight. The sets, costumes and script are fantastic! This is a film I purchased for my meager DVD film library. It's one I tend to revisit from time to time. I highly recommend it 
Personally, I quite enjoyed this film. I orginally chose to watch it out of an interest in the Tudor family. However, I had little specific knowledge of Lady Jane's history. It was a little slow at times, and I'll admit to finding it a few minutes too long, but, overall, I rather liked it. Naturally, I was quite disappointed to learn afterwards that the romance between Jane and Guilford was wholly fabricated. Some may complain that it ruins the film, but I disagree. I felt it was a welcome addition, as it added humanity and beauty to a bleak, tragic story, making it easier to relate to. I actually found the romance plausible, though not terribly likely. But I am a romantic, not a realist. Those who prefer action films or accurate factual reports may not enjoy the film, but it's a must for any idealists in possesion of true Rennaissance hearts 
History, so it seems, does not make good stuff for movies, so moviemakers tend to add bits of their own invention to make it all palatable to the moviegoing audience. In the case of poor little Jane Grey, one might just wish that her desperate and short life would at least have offered the comfort of such a passionate marriage as she gets here - which, alas, it didn't. Played out as a pawn in an elaborate succession ploy cooked up by her father-in-law, Jane was forced to marry a dispicable man, became queen for 9 days, and then, thanks to an inconceivably stupid eleventh hour rebellion by her father, went to the block with a calm dignity belying her mere 16 years. This movie has the gist of it, and makes for over two hours of good, solid entertainment. As costume drama goes, it is caught somewhere halfway between Errol Flynn and the BBC Virgin Queen. Sets and costumes are sumptuous if not quite historically correct (dresses, for instance, did not have all-round bodices, but were assembled from lots of bits and pieces pinned to the undergarments). Clearly, costumes were chosen for their dramatic effect, and as such work very well. Splendid Queen Mary in her red dress looks almost like Disney's witch Malificent, and the all white winter hunting party is very stylish indeed (though Star Trek reminiscenses are inevitable when Patrick Stewart appears in his stylized Tudor garments). The acting is altogether quite good, with Bonham Carter, unsurprisingly, taking the laurels. Elwes does all he can with the heavily romanticized version of Guildford Dudley on offer in this script. It is hardly his fault that the rapid transformation from dissolute drunkard and whoremonger into ardent lover and idealistic defender of the poor does not come across as quite believable (he does better with the drunkard than with the idealist, by the way). Sara Kestelman is excellent as Jane's cruel and selfisch mother, and John Wood even better as the sinister, scheming Northumberland. Warren Saire deserves mention too, for his sympathetic and moving portrayal of the doomed King Edward VI. Jane Lapotaire brings subtlety to Queen Mary's character, and succeeds in making it felt that this queen isn't up for a very happy reign either. This is a quiet movie, with a slow pace, that is carried by the believable chemistry between the two leads. It communicates a strong sense of the cruelty of those days, when death and disgrace were always lurking around the corner and individual fates counted for nothing. It does not eschew the clich, to which it occassionally succumbs in rather silly ways (e.g., Jane muses on her impending death and a flock of birds flies by). The music is horribly bombastic and at times quite misplaced. Yet none of this results in serious damage, and the end, featuring a minute reconstruction of Jane's execution, may well leave you a little shaken; - the image of the blindfolded young girl desperatly groping for the block, is quite unsettling. In all, a worthwhile and interesting movie 
I hear Helena is a bear to work with, but the results are always worth the wait and the grief. Even so young, she brings such intensity to the screen, you can't bear to look away. A little piece of history dramatized and played before your eyes with passion and vitality. Wonderful midweek escapist movie with tea and crumpets 
This film just goes to show that sometimes your family can be your worst enemy. Ms. Carter was an excellent "Queen" Jane and the actress who played "Bloody" Mary was outstanding! I am so glad that I was not around in Tudor England 
I have this movie in VHS format. I simply loved it! Being a Renaissance/Medevial fan, I found the costumes just wonderful. Even though, the history books tell us that Jane Grey and Guilford Dudley weren't as passionate as the film depicted, I found the love scenes nice. I have read all the books about Jane Grey to know that she came from a time of abuse. Historians potray her as a "plain" girl with reddish hair. She probably looked after her great uncle Henry VIII. I can go on and on about this, but I won't. Just read up on the history and enjoy the film for what it is made for...entertainment 
Dated, derivative, self-indulgent unintelligent. This is truly bottom of the range stuff. The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire. None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully. I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour). Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase. 
Like most people, I saw this first on cable. About the same time, I saw Sean Penn's directorial debut, "The Indian Runner". I had a great respect for Independent films, like, forever, and "One False Move" is among the best. Carl Franklin is to be commended for putting the script (Billy Bob Tom Epperson) to film in a concise fashion. I don't agree with previous reviewers who thought it needed more ground. This is indeed an original. Bill Paxton, in his first lead role, is excellent, and hasn't been as good since (though I liked his smarmy performance in "True Lies") and the wonderful Cynda Williams won awards for her performance as Fantasia/Lila. The film score is legendary...indeed, Peter Haycock Derek Holt wrote a score that has been used in a whole bunch of cheesy films of the 90's; I don't really know if it was original for this one, but the use of the music by Terry Plumeri was effective and haunting. Billy Bob was a fine psychotic, and the most frightening performance of all came from Michael Beach as Pluto, never breaking a sweat as he slit a throat. Paxton really carries the film, along with Ms. Williams; you really want these people to survive. Life might be like that; a great exposition of good and evil, and delivered in fine fashion by the wonderful Carl Franklin. 
I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie. Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language! A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
I caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and I could not remember the name but I did know who stared in it...so when i went online to get the name of this I was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price...Thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly!!! Thanks again!! 
Billy Bob co-wrote and stars in this tightly woven, deeply textured, well-written off-beat thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from CA to AK; combines the personal, the interpersonal, the deviant, with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle. This was on Roger Ebert's top ten list the year it came out. Although there are a couple of plot flaws, it works well enough to keep you anticipating the "showdown," because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny. This is a rare type of film nowadays: the kind that comes from the heart, not from the sterile factories of M.F.A. programs and lunkhead studios. 
i saw OFM when it first came out, over ten years back. it was on cable the other day. it still keeps me glued to the set. bill paxton, billy bob thornton, michael beach....great work. too bad this one didn't get more media and a larger audience 
I really liked this film. Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker. This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today. You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors. I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest. It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World. It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time. Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year). Moore in recent years has become a "political celebrity", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America. It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too. They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows. A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods. I don't know if Moore is like that or not. But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America. 
Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by GM's unhealthy cost structure. The company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney UAW sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it. Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
Leftist-Anti Establishmentarian Michael Moore is mad as hell and he's not taking it anymore as his smalltown America, Flint, MI has just lost 30,000+ jobs as greedy G.Motors Exects move plant to Mexico and put above mentioned thousands out of work. Moore does a good job of keeping the subject serious for a change. Other good Moore films included Fahrenheit 911 and The Big One. Others he's done get too far into his leftist politics which I am (far-political-middle/Populist) am not into. Good job here, Michael 
The film is a wonderful snapshot of the decline and fall of an American town. The scenes of parties for Flint's rich folks and GM executives, interspersed with poor workers being evicted from their homes, are great. I also loved seeing Reagan and hearing the Flint citizens talk about how he was going to bring the jobs back. This is the President who put our country on the road to bankruptcy. Moore wants to save his home town and help people in poverty. He's a sincere guy. I'm less convinced that the proposals he has in mind would accomplish anything. As I see it, the problem in Flint is not that GM is a bad corporate citizen, or that the government isn't doing enough to help the poor. The real difficulty is that Flint's prosperity in the 50s and 60s was an illusion to begin with. After the Second World War America chose to base its transportation system on the automobile. This seemed to work OK for a while, because gasoline seemed to be plentiful and cheap. Unfortunately, this approach to transportation had some nasty side effects. It made our towns ugly and our people fat, not to mention changing the climate. Today we're coming to the end of the era of cheap oil with the passing of Hubbert's peak. Oil comes from millions of years' worth of stored sunlight, and when it's gone, it's gone. In the next few decades getting around at all is going to become increasingly difficult. We'll be wishing that we had invested in streetcar lines and walkable cities instead of all those freeways. The automobile is still subsidized to the tune of billions of dollars in America today. That's just money down a rat hole. For more perspective on the dominance of the automobile in American life, I would suggest Kunstler's books "The Geography of Nowhere" and "The Long Emergency." I also highly recommend Shoup's book "The High Cost of Free Parking. 
What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void. The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it. Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both. 
what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke. I hated it 
I gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary. It falls more along the same fodder as "Spinal Tap". It is missing a counter point from GM. One could argue that Roger had chances to talk with Moore, but choose not to. One the other hand, Rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold. I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film. An interview would have killed the tone. Watch the nightly news NOW. Last night, March 22nd 2006, GM offered a one time buy out to some of it's employees. The news reported that GM cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW (Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film). This same thing happened in the late 1980's and brought forth this extremely biased movie. This film is entertaining in a strange way, but should not be considered to be the absolute truth. Watch it with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Under close examination, Careful consideration and Keen intellect, you will see a undercover message You might need to examine closely the content. Outwardly, things are not what they seem Until you look more closely. Many times the basic concept is Misread in the dialog Once you see this, and Open your mind to it, Rational thought will Emerge 
Michael Moore's first major film was one of his best in my opinion for two reasons. First off, since he did not yet have a trademark style, he did not try to go over the top in this film as much as he does in his subsequent efforts. He does his normal routine of tracking people down in an effort to embarrass them by asking them pointed questions, but for most of the film he lets the story and the citizens of Flint do the talking. As you probably already know, this is the story of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan, and the utter despair that fell upon it after GM began shuttering auto plants under the supervision of then CEO Roger Smith. The film really highlights how clueless Flint's elite are as to the suffering that all of this "consolidation" is causing. At one point in the film Moore is talking to some wealthy people at a party who seem to think they are doing the unemployed some kind of favor by hiring them to act as living statues at one of their fetes. When he asks the partygoers about what is going on in Flint they seem somewhat offended that there is such "negative publicity" circulating and say there should be more emphasis on the positive things going on in Flint - they name the symphony and the opera. Ah yes, let them eat opera glasses! The second reason I consider this film to be one of Moore's best is that even though this film was made in 1989, it is still interesting and relevant today. This is because the contrast between what average working people have to endure - the struggle to find secure jobs with decent benefits and their increasing vulnerability - and the desire of the captains of industry to improve the bottom line at any cost ... as long as it doesn't cost them ... has only worsened and deepened over the last 17 years since this film was first made. 
Documentary on the destruction of Flint, MI, with the closing of GM plants there and the laying off of 30,000 workers. Michael Moore is the filmmaker and Roger is Roger Smith, the head of GM at the time, whom he tries, without success, to interview on the tragedy at Flint. Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too. The movie goes on a bit too long and certain scenes seem to be there for effect only (for example, those with a woman who raises rabbits for food - we see her actually skinning one), but it's a good documentary nonetheless 
This is a great family movie, a fresh take on enchantment stories. It's rather in the style of E. Nesbit's books, using contemporary references. I find it far superior to many of Disney's usual works. It's enjoyable for adults and kids 
Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) is an unusual child. As a baby, a bumbling fairy godmother named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gave her the gift of obedience. Every time anyone gives her a direct command, she must obey. Despite, or maybe because of, this "gift," Ella grows to be a headstrong woman. She goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres, giants, and elves. Current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only. But Ella campaigns for their equality. She is also one of the few women in the realm who doesn't swoon at the site of Prince Char (Hugh Dancy). When the two meet accidentally, Char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman. Trouble is brewing at home, however. Ella's stepsister Hattie (Lucy Punch) has figured out Ella's secret. Now, Ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do. So she leaves home and sets out to find Lucinda to give the gift back. I had missed seeing this movie in the theater, and finally got a chance to watch it. I missed a real treat. The movie is funny from start to finish, and I had a grin on my face the entire time. While the story is a bit predictable, it isn't super preachy. The cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life. The only drawback to the movie is the special effects. While some worked well, most of the time they weren't up to today's standards. While the main audience might be teen girls, this is one adult male who loved it. It's sweet, charming, and entertaining. What more could you want 
I feel deeply for those who have had their favorite books ripped to shreds by a movie (nothing on earth could tempt me to see the new Flicka movie)--but I haven't read this book. I absolutely loved this movie with all of it's 70's songs. The costumes, sets, and fx were cheesy and cheap--but I'll take them over the cold, computer-generated world of Shrek any day of the week. This movie even made the Princess Bride seem a bit dreary--I'll take Ella over Buttercup any day of the week, too. The cast pours their heart and soul into this and obviously had a blast making it. I had a blast watching it--I laughed out loud a number of times and sang along with the tunes. This is 96 minutes of pure escapist fare--buy it and enjoy. It's definitely for kids, but sometimes that's a good things for adults 
this is movie not every one will like. it is loosley based on the book by gail carson levine. the movie is about a girl named ella who at birth got the gift of obedenice. ella has to do everything she is told, when she gets fedup she runsaway home to find the fairy who gave her this gift. along the way she meets a elf and prince. this movie is like the wizard of oz meets cinderella 
ok SO FIRST LETS GET ONE THING STRAIT THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER AND THATS ABOUT IT.ok so I really liked the book and i was excited when i heard they were making a movie of it but then i saw it and didn't even end up finishing it it was soooooo bad they ruin everything nothing is the same...and when they go to the giant village there like belly dancing and Ella is singing?????? alright that doesn't even sound good but theres a ton of other things as well but it would take to long to right it all down. I really sugest that you don't wast your time on this movie its not funny cute profitible not anything except bad. ITS A WAST OF TIME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. 
Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination. Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead? I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers. But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal. And the film design! Bleh! Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake. The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated. I felt so much dumber after watching this movie. I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book. Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites. I don't know why I thought of that book just now. I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much 
I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book? If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do. I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright. If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds. It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even. I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful. I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is. I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right 
It must have made a HUGE difference for me that I saw the movie before I read the book - and that I have 3 little girls - based on some of the other reviews for this movie. I really enjoyed the movie (as did my girls - they watch it over and over). It was just fun and sweet. I really enjoyed the "modern" and comic spin on the fairy tale, medieval setting. I couldn't wait to read the book. I will admit I was a little bit confused when the storyline turned out to be different, but as I continued to read I really started to appreciate the common themes between movie and book - and how they'd chosen to portray them in the movie. I also appreciated the book on its own. I was glad that it was different from the movie. It was the same yet different in a way that made it fun to read. I didn't already know how everything was going to go or how it would end - except in a general "happy ending" sense. After reading the book I could also understand why they chose to put the story on screen the way they had. From my perspective anyway, I think to put it onscreen exactly as in the book would have taken some of the magic out of it. It was definitely magical and just right in the book but in the movie I really think it would have come across as cliche - just another telling of the Cinderella story. Instead, the movie honored the themes of the book while stepping things up for the screen - spinning the story differently and making them bigger than life/outlandish (if you will). Highly entertaining and I'd recommend book and movie to anyone - especially if you have little girls. Just remember - to get the best out of both - watch the film first 
If I could make one change to this movie, it would be near the end when Angel (Isaac Hayes) tells what happened to each of the characters...I would have added a brief cameo of Muriel (played brilliantly by Rosie Perez) getting her just desserts...I would show Muriel, working in a nail salon, with a bitter look on her face, slamming things around, with a rude customer barking orders at her. Other than that, great movie! 
What a disappointment! I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy. Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never. Very predictable plot from beginning to end. And Rosie Perez was truly offensive. A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying. There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other. Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language. Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene. It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way. I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners. Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler] But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
Light-hearted rendition of the true-to-life story of a police officer who was forced by his conscience to share his lottery winnings with a waitress, fulfilling a promise he made when he was otherwise unable to leave a tip. Presents the ways in which sudden prosperity changes people, for the better or worse. A little sappy in order to please the ladies; a little action and a good story so as to please everyone - even us 'macho guys'. 
It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day. The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all. Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong. Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
May be you don' t believe it, but from time to time, there are certain poetic films that would seem to recover its majesty even in the most unexpected circumstances. The plot is a fairy tale indeed, but in last instance, who cares about it ?. The final intentions are precisely what it counts. A winning lottery ticket will become the sparkling breach to narrate a story that surely will enchant you. A marriage in disgrace due both of them would seem to talk by different TV channels. His marriage is far to be a dialogue, but an exchange of monologues. A honest man, a good guy, a candid man, is a cop in NYC, an ambitious wife; a disillusioned woman plenty of good feelings who suddenly will meet one each other in this little picture of low budget perhaps, but loaded of spring vision. There will be a gradual, very emotive and absolutely expected love affair between these solitaire souls, that will experience certainly new, varied, encountered and cruel emotions. I have always been engaging with Bridget Fonda as actress. She possesses that delirious touch just reserved to a few artists. She illuminates the screen with her mesmerizing sidereal beauty ornamented with her nave smile; she is a lovely and very talented artist who stole the show along the picture. Rosie Perez is fine as the ambitious wife and the great Seymour Cassel as the elegant Jack Gross is terrific. Nicholas Cage in one of his best performances ever; very natural and credible in that character The script has no fissures, the frame is the always changing City of the World and the fit camera of Andrew Bergman, will allow to reconcile us with the life through this unusual film, without special effects, free of violence, chase cars and sensationalist explosions. I swear it. A beauty parable of the Good Samaritan, and the expected boomerang reaction of the community respect this very weird behavior. The Angel 's device is imported from "The wings of desire". And the final shot of the red balloon floating over Central Park is a well deserved homage to Albert Lamouirise ` s The Red Balloon. 
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
I got the fortune of watching this movie when it was reraned on Showtime. I never liked anything I seen that had Nicolas Cage, but watching this movie made me change my mind about the guy. This movie is excellent from beginning to end. Another solid 1990s love story, where wins and loss of lottery doesn't change a person's attitude 
This is a nice love story, a little dumbed down, but with a great message, the money may be the root of all evil, and what is important is the human heart. This is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world. Nicholas Cage is one of our finest commercial actors. He proves is versatility in this picture. What ever happened to Bridget Fonda?? J 
I was 7 when I watched these shows. Great memories. And Soupy Sales is an added bonus!! Just amazing how things have changed... Not sure if this set will appeal to the younger crowd, but for us aging baby boomers it's a fun trip 
These shows are excellent capsules of the early 60's, featuring not just The Beatles, but Davy Jones (part of the Oliver! cast), Frank Gorshin (whom I remember better as "The Riddler" on Batman), Soupy Sales, Cab Calloway,etc. The point of sale, is of course, the 20 performances by The Beatles, presented in very good shape here (as opposed to the numerous copies of copies boots and chopped specials). The sound and pictures being from a 4-decade old videotape are better than expected, and kudos to whoever did the mastering. In other reviews, the other acts get panned, but they are good as well, Sullivan wasn't just a vaudeville rehash. Part of the problem with seeing the comedians,etc. now is that you need to know about the people being referred to (such as Allen and Rossi's bits with Sonny Liston and LBJ). Overall,well worth the price of admission for these trips back to 1964 and 1965 
As my brother is a huge Beatles fan I got this DVD set for him this Christmas. I too am a fan, especially of the early days and we immediately fired up the DVD. I am too young to have seen these performances originally and all I've ever seen our clips or perhaps one complete song performed by the Beatles. But in this set you get the complete Ed Sullivan shows from the the Beatles four appearances in 1964 ad 1965. Not just the Beatles mind you, but you get the ENTIRE show with all of the other performers as well as the original commercials. Really incredible! Many of these performers have long since been forgotten but some are familar such as Cab Calloway, impressionist Frank Gorshin, Mitzi Gaynor, and Soupy Sales. One thing I never knew until now is that the Beatles didn't perform just one song but they did as many as SIX songs everytime they appeared on Sullivan! This really is a testament to just how popular they were. In fact, Sullivan actually took his show on the road to a Miami Hotel where the Beatles were performing JUST so he could have them on again. Many of the songs are repeated over the four appearances but in all you get the Beatles performing 20 songs including seven #1 hits. "All my Loving", "She Loves you", "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", "From Me to You", "Twist Shout", "Help" and "Yesterday" are just a few of the songs on this two DVD set. The quality of the prints are very good. Truly a time-machine back to a magical time and place 
Thanks to Sofa/GoodTimes for doing up this set the right way. So many variety shows presented us with great entertainment during the golden era of television. Yet, I know of very few which are available in their entirety on DVD! The majority of nods to this genre are done in a "Best Of" edited format. This is not the way the shows were meant to be seen, and certainly not the way I want to watch them. (This carries over to numerous genres, as well. I don't want a DVD of World Series highlights. I want the whole games!) Sofa/GoodTimes has maintained these four shows intact, including both the good and the bad acts....and even including the commercials!!! They should be congratulated for the former and applauded for the latter. The video varies in quality. But one must remember that these shows weren't preserved in the same manner as "I Love Lucy", and thus, can't be expected to be pristine. Now if only someone would issue full episodes of "The Hollywood Palace" 
I give it 5 stars just for the ads alone! I'd already seen the Beatle footage over the years, most of the other acts were very ordinary with the exceptions of Soupy Sales, Morecombe and Wise, Cab Calloway, and Acker Bilk. The ads make the buying of this DVD worthwhile. My favorites were the silly 1965 Lipton Ice Tea ad with George Fenneman in the little boat, the Stepfordish 1964 Lipton ad with the wife making her husband a cup of tea in the creepiest looking kitchen I've seen, and of course the cute "Pilsbury Push Button Cake Decorator" ad from the second show. If Pilsbury made and sold products in Australia I would have bought one just because I like the old commercial so much. Who said old advertising doesn't work? But seriously, that's what I personally like about this set, buy it yourself, even if you don't like ads or whatever. You can always skip thru them, they couldn't back in the 60's 
it's interesting to see the beatles within the context of their contemporaries in the entertainment world of 1964. i wasn't born at the time so it is something of a revelation to me. some of the other acts on the show are embarrassingly bad, but this was the state of the still infantile tv of the time. the beatles ushered in a period of unbridled creativity that was only hinted at during this period. the video quality is poor much of the time when compared to the same clips as presented in the beatles anthology series. ed himself seems to have all the charisma and savy of a stuffed hippo, but he certainly managed to pull in some of the finest musical acts of the sixties over the course of his run. he was mtv, vh1, and soul train all rolled into one. ed gave america the beatles and we shouldn't forget him for that 
I am old enough to claim that the Beatles were still technically a group when I was born. But I wasn't one of the millions upon millions of people who saw these shows when they were originally broadcast. Considering so many people (listeners, fans, musicians, journalists) all agree that this was a pinnacle moment for them, the shows themselves had been pretty much hidden from public view since they aired. I had seen the clips of them playing in the "Anthology" and other documentaries. I thought their performances were fun, but I never had a feeling of how they fit in with contemporary 1964 culture and why it was all such a big deal. Until now. The two-set DVD has the four Ed Sullivan shows, complete with commercials, from February, 1964 and September, 1965. All I can say is... wow. The shows themselves feature a variety of acts, but they all share one thing in common: they are all totally lame compared to the Beatles. Mitzi Gaynor singing "It's Too Darn Hot"? Yikes! The comedy musings of Dave Barry? Oh dear. I can commiserate all too well with the Anacin commerical as it intones, "pain... pain... pain..." Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh here. I did enjoy Tessie O'Shea. She's not cool and she's not trying to be. She's just having fun and it's infectious as she belts her way through a bunch of old standards. The bit from "Oliver!" was cute (see the young Davy Jones, later of Monkees fame) and it was historically amusing to see Sonny Liston take a bow as the "heavyweight champion of the world"... when we know he will be knocked out by Cassius Clay the following week. You begin to understand how much of a shock the Beatles were to the national psyche. Long hair? Maybe not from today's standards, but look at what everyone else looks like on these shows! Music? Well, today Beatles music is all mixed up on the radio, played against songs made some 10 - 20 years after their debut. Here, you can see what they were up against at the moment... and they just blow the doors off of everyone including Cilla Black, one of their contemporaries. The video is clearest on the clips that feature the Beatles (as you would imagine). The rest varies. Some looks a bit blurred and there are some analog tracking issues. Well, the videotape is 40 years old, in a format that has been dead for at least 20 years. It's probably a miracle that the shows look as clean as they do. The sound is pretty good, but keep in mind that these were live performances. And "TV" and "hi-fidelity" didn't exactly go hand in hand in 1964. The second show in "Myamuh Beach" has some serious audio defects, but that's how it sounded then. I enjoyed the live performances, warts and all. Unlike a lot of shows from the 1960's, the performances on Ed Sullivan were live rather than lip-synched. DVD extras? Not a one. The shows themselves are the extras. There's no documentaries necessary, no secondary audio channel needed to explain the phenomenon, it's just, "Ladies and Gentlemen... the Beatles". And really, that's all you need in the end 
I taped these performances on my old monaural reel-to-reel back in 1964. The recorder and tapes are long gone, but the memories of a time when four "twenty-something" guys in suits could be considered revolutionaries still stands out in my mind as a golden age. Like it was yesterday, I remember John wrestling with his microphone, Ed admonishing the audience about their behavior, I even remember the other acts we had to sit through to get to the Fab Four. What a time capsule! The image quality and sound will blow you away - much better than what we ever received over the air back in the day. You even get a choice of monaural or surround sound - sharp. This CD set is a great treat for anyone over a certain age (the break point may be 50 years old/young, I imagine). Kids today may find it difficult to understand how one band could generate this much excitement and energy but if you were around in '64 and you saw them live you know! Buy this with confidence and throw in the DVD of a Hard Day's Night - both are a must have for any Beatles fan. Now if I could only fit into my old Neru jacket, life would be perfect 
If you are interested in Gypsy music and dance this is an incredible look at the culture, sans boring narration blah blah. Because Mr. Gatlif had unprecedented access to these relatively unspoiled groups of performers, the viewer feels like a traveler on the Gypsy Trail, starting out in India,through Egypt, Turkey and through the Balkans, ending with a lively village Flamenco scene. I wish that they had continued into England and Ireland, but that is a minor quibble. Each scene goes directly into the performances, with so much feeling and joy. Not to be missed 
The Gypsies left their original homeland in northern India around 1000AD. This much has been established by historical and linguistic research, but the reason for their exodus westward is less certain. They reached Europe by the early C14th, crossing from Asia Minor by way of Crete and the Peloponnesus, and continued their dispersal westward and northward. By the end of the C14th they were already settled in large numbers in the Balkans and Danube lands, where an undeveloped economic structure and primitive technology gave Gypsy smiths and cobblers the chance to compete with local artisans. Early accounts of their arrival suggest that the curiosity and sympathy they originally aroused were accompanied by suspicion and hostlity, and soon their status changed dramatically from protected guests to persecuted outlaws. Within a 100 years of their first appearance, most countries in western Europe had passed savage laws for their expulsion: some even legislated to include the death penalty. 'Lacho Drom' is a wonderful travelogue of Rom music which traces this migration. The music and demeanour of the people says it all; languages that transcend regional barriers. Clearly, by Czechoslovakia, we have entered the Rom estate popularised by European literature's cliches, extolled by the excessive practice of all vices known to Man. The film's concluding lament caps an increasingly sad tale of persecution born, nevertheless, with brave equanimity. The appropriate footnote, if you can source it, is Joseph Koudelka's grave portfolio of Gypsies that was published by Aperture in the mid 1970s. I hestitate to trumpet aesthetics here, where it obviously hurts, but Koudelka's images are some of the most stunningly beautiful you'll ever see. There's nothing vouyeristic about Koudelka as in nearly every instance he's acknowledged by his subjects. And that implicit trust is rarely evinced anywhere, anytime, resulting in a candour that might well move you to tears 
This is one of my favorite documentary, still wish that they would release on DVD! I love the stories, and the beauty that it shows. It also is a great way to see the life style of Nomads from all over the world 
Fascinating, educating, beautifully done. Congratulations to the film maker and the sound maker. A story in music louder than words 
If you enjoy flamenco, Indian, or middle eastern music, you will love this movie. I did! I discovered it by accident a few years ago and I've never forgotten it 
A seamless cinematic journey--a musical video of sorts-- tracing the history of the Rom people, also known as gypsies. Through music and dance, using non -actors, this movie shows us a world little seen by outsiders. Colorful, vivid, at times heart breakingly tender, showing impoverished nomads through time. Ultimately life affirming, at least to me, it is a film I return to again and again. I wish it was on DVD. Highest rating. 
A beautiful flowing story without dialog or plot, that opens a window into the traditional music of the Romish peoples 
After searching for hours, I found the DVD in a online store in Japan called CD Japan (cdjapan.co.jp) 
If you love your fellow man, your love will be reinforced. If you enjoy exquisite cinematography,direction and editing, you will be glad you saw Latcho Drom. Tony Gatlif was possesed by the Supreme Being, to have constructed such a mosaic of souls,songs and faces. Now painful now joyful; a historical human continuum that proves we are all innocent children of the Universe - much Loved. 
The house of Eliott is an excellent British series about two sisters suddenly left penniless in postwar England. To make ends meet they take in sewing, and eventually open a dress shop. The two sisters are very good friends with the older sister (Bea) being the more practical sister and the younger sister (Evie) more impulsive and kind hearted. I liked the series a great deal. The costumes, historic detail and characters are wonderful. At times I found myself annoyed by Evie (who I thought was occasionally inconsiderate and selfish), but that's what makes great characters. They are memorable and flawed. I also didn't care for the suffragette character who was a bit harsh in her judgement of her fellow man. Sometimes listening to her scolding other characters for their selfish ways ruined the mood (at least for me). While I concede poverty and inequity are serious issues, having her bray about it bored me. 5 stars. Excellent 
This fabulous series, a hit around the world, was not filmed in London, but in my ex home city of Bristol, in the Clifton district and in the country houses of Wiltshire, such as Stourhead, and surrounding countryside to be exact. Many locations I know well and recognise. Clifton is a mini Bath, with similar fashionable features, buildings and parks, and my distant ancestor, the Spanish Empress Eugenie also lived there in the 19th century. However, it provided the BBC with an ideal place to film this series and it created a gripping rags to riches tale of two sisters making it in the 1920s fashion trade, and the stunning costumes were second to none. An added dash of romance, a horrible villan who got his just deserts, a gorgeous damsel, the perfect English rose at his mercy, plus lots of other characters providing fun and entertainment and plenty of meaty story lines, not to mention glamour by the bucket load, and you have a dvd set to treasure. Having the series on dvd now, means it is preserverd for future generations and the picture will never fade. Once again, this is the BBC at its very best, justly proving its reputation for great drama at home and abroad. The dvd set is a worthwhile addition to any home collection and I will certainly be adding each set as they come.  
Although this series is from the early '90s, I only recently discovered it. A timeless story about coming of age - for both of the main characters, as well as the transitional time period of the 1920's for women. The story caught me immediately as I could relate to the characters struggle. While the two sisters have grown up comfortable and sheltered, their father's sudden death leaves them with an uncertain future. Their realistic fate greets them with constant challenges to be overcome. The older sister Beatrice has a great deal of emotional baggage from having to raise her sister and missing her chance at marriage. According to her time period she might be considered an old maid, so she is understandably a little bitter and uncompromising. However, she is a likeable character with much creativity and sensibility. Evangeline, the younger sister, seems intelligent but often immature. Portrayed as most young adults as being opinionated without experience, but her innocence makes her charming and creative. She is free from the baggage that her sister carries, however life will not leave her unaffected. Obviously it is on this age difference and maturity that the sisters often clash despite their close relationship. The series also delves into the 1920s lifestyle describing women on the verge of independence. Some are clinging to the outdated traditions, while others are embracing the change. Needless to say that the sets and fashions in the series are excellent. The DVD visual quality seems adequate, although I agree with another review that the sound quality is poor. Music seems loud, while taking too low. I've had the volume at max as well. And a shame there are no captions or subtitles to make up for this audio lack. I also wish there were some extras to go with the series. Overall, I would highly recommend the series. I watched it with my mother, so its a great show to share with someone else 
If you love British costume drama, this is for you. Set in the roaring 20s, the story of the two Eliott sisters starting their own fashion house is a delight. Their challenges - professional, social and personal are set out in 12, hour-long episodes. The cast are all competant actors, the script and story well set up, not to mention the gorgeous dresses! This is a quality BBC production. I agree with another reviewer that the sound can be a bit variable at times. A minor annoyance. In every other way, technically sound 
For some bewildering reason, the transfer for this wonderful series has very poor sound. One has to raise the volume to the max, to even begin to hear it. Much of the dialogue is swallowed. A pity. And no, I am not going deaf: when you put another DVD title in, at the same sound level, the track is deafeningly LOUD. Otherwise, a terrific romp through the '20s 
I first saw this show on on A several years back and taped it then. The DVD version has a few small scenes that were cut for A commercials,the story is great , the digital color remastering is superior!!! The only thing I miss is the commentary at the beginning and end of each episodes by Jean Marsh which was part of the A presentation. I also hope and pray that Acornmedia will also put out the second and third seasons of this great drama....If you love costume design, this is the one to watch!!!!!!!!!!! 
This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is smart, classy and of coarse very British 
In this scary movie. Mark's mum dies when he is about 10 years old and he goes to stay with his uncle, aunt and cousins for a fortnight while his dad goes on a business trip. He is also under psychiatric treatment because of the trauma of his mother's death. Mark innocently gets involved in Henry's evil plans to kill and maim for fun!! Henry gives the impression of being a little angel to his parents and uncle and only shows his darker side to Mark. He even tries to convince everyone that his evil ideas have come from Mark because of the traumatic loss of his mum. Mark fails to convince his father, his uncle, his aunt or his psychiatrist of the evil doings of Henry right up to the end of the film. I won't spoil it for you by telling you the outcome. A very enjoyable film that had me on the edge of my seat almost all through 
this must have seemed like a great idea at the time,"cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor". the problem is his range is all the way from a to b. this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many "chance" happenings. in the end all we get is this "thriller"(and i use the term very loosely)that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling 
This film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it. The plot is not very intriguing, and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life, so it lacks this sense of reality. A dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer, which is exactly the point of this movie. However, this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end, and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute. Elijah Wood is stunning, only due to his efforts can the film get some believability. Caulkin is perfect in this role too, portraying the bad boy, I have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor. Maybe only comparing to Elijah, but hey, he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever, so no wonder you cannot compete with him... Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for Elijah Wood fans! 
Culkin(henry) does a good job portraying a scary lunatic, because he gives off a spooky air. His acting, however is very dull, and takes away from the movie. HOWEVER, Culkins dry (but convinving) performance is completely compensated for with the performance of Elijah Wood (Mark). Not only is mark the most adorable, loveable child, but his performance is jaw-dropping. The spotlight for this movie really belongs to Wood. He acts every scene out with the utmost emotion, and passion. He makes this movie one of the best. It is the battle between good (Mark) and evil (Henry). Henry plays a lunatic son, who does awful things to his family and others. Mark comes to live with Henry and his family for a while after his mom dies. Henry is Mark's cousin (too bad for Mark). Mark can see the evil lurking within henry, but can he prove it to his aunt and uncle(henry's parents) before it is too late? 
Two great child stars blended together into one suspense movie. Although, you don't really get the feel of suspense because of the peaceful and flowing music, the message behind the plot would really give you the chills. Elijah Wood acted out every expression he had to act out fully with his face. You could really see the fear in his eyes when he realizes Henry(Macaulay Culkin) is planning to hurt someone. The story begins with a vast highland then starts off with Mark (Elijah) playing soccer with his friends. Then, out of the blue, his dad appears and we are brought to a hospital scene where Mark sits beside his mother's deathbed. He promises her that she won't die. Unfortunately, she does and Mark is full of sadness at her funeral. His dad has to go to a business trip to Japan for 2 weeks leaving him behind with Henry's family. At first, he gets along well with Henry but soon finds out his evil schemes. Henry always gets away with all his schemes with his angelic smile. I thought Elijah was great, as he always is in all his movies. Though he was only a kid back then, he acted from his heart. As for Macaulay, I thought he really showed a sense of madness and jealousy but lost expression at times. He was great at expressing silent anger and suspense. He showed that he was fully in the dark side. Although he had little changes in facial expressions and reactions from that of 'Home Alone', I still have to give him credit for acting such a difficult role. If you've never been on stage or films before, you'd never know how hard it is to act as a villain than a hero. Some scenes really impressed me especially the cliff scene. It's amazing how the production managed to shoot that part without any visual effects especially with two young lads. All in all, I thought the movie was entertaining. I was impressed at how 12-year-olds could do really well at their age. I'm already 15 and have experienced acting on stage and you all must know. It's not easy. Before critizing their acting, you have to think that they're only kids and I have to say, they were very professional. If you like movies with suspense and drama, you'd better watch this. Along with these two very expressive actors. Highly recommended 
{spoilers}: "If I let you go...do you think you could fly?" This is what I think is a special quote when I watched the theatrical trailer on my DVD of "The Good Son" and it is a very interesting opposite turn in Macaulay Culkin's career from the "Home Alone" movies to this where he plays a murderer named Henry. This is really worth watching if you've never seen it and if you like thrillers. Mark Evans {Elijah Wood} goes to live with his aunt and uncle and his cousin Henry after his mother dies and his father goes away on a business trip. When Mark first meets Henry, they are great friends. Their friendship goes too far when Henry soon becomes evil and Mark is the only one who sees the truth about his cousin after he kills a dog with a crossbow and Henry wants Mark to have fun in his own way when Henry throws his dummy Mr. Highway onto a crowded highway and causes a pileup, and while Henry tries to kill his sister several times. Later on, Mark keeps trying to convince Henry's mother Susan {Wendy Crewson} that Henry is murderous and she doesn't believe him, so Mark is left to confront Henry before anything worse can happen. I usually don't watch thrillers, but this is cool. I thought it was worth seeing to see Macaulay Culkin's psychotic acting and it is worth about 4 and a half stars because it starts out a little slow, but when Henry's friendly behavior changes, it's worth all the rest that it's worth. 
After the death of his mother, Elijah Wood is left with his uncle's family while dad David Morse takes off for two weeks to settle their future. Uncle has two children: a little girl and an older boy Wood's age: Macaulay Culkin. Behind Culkin's angelic visage, naturally, lurks the soul of a devil. Wood suspects the evil, but no one will believe him, and so he is left alone to try to stop the increasingly deadly games his cousin is playing. Director Joseph P. Ruben made something of a career of telling tales of domestic horror, what with this, The Stepfather and Sleeping with the Enemy. He claims, in the featurette, to want to reverse our expectations about Culkin's character, which is, of course, nonsense: we know going in that he's bad. And familiar as Evil Child territory is (think The Bad Seed, The Other, The Omen, etc., etc., etc.), this is still an effective example of the genre, benefiting from an admirably economical narrative. The menu is basic, as are the extras: the theatrical trailer, and the usual featurette. Nuthin' special. Very much a catalogue-filler release, with no real value-added on this disc. Sound and picture are acceptable, and the movie is a decent 86 minutes 
Dated, derivative, self-indulgent unintelligent. This is truly bottom of the range stuff. The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire. None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully. I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour). Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase. 
Like most people, I saw this first on cable. About the same time, I saw Sean Penn's directorial debut, "The Indian Runner". I had a great respect for Independent films, like, forever, and "One False Move" is among the best. Carl Franklin is to be commended for putting the script (Billy Bob Tom Epperson) to film in a concise fashion. I don't agree with previous reviewers who thought it needed more ground. This is indeed an original. Bill Paxton, in his first lead role, is excellent, and hasn't been as good since (though I liked his smarmy performance in "True Lies") and the wonderful Cynda Williams won awards for her performance as Fantasia/Lila. The film score is legendary...indeed, Peter Haycock Derek Holt wrote a score that has been used in a whole bunch of cheesy films of the 90's; I don't really know if it was original for this one, but the use of the music by Terry Plumeri was effective and haunting. Billy Bob was a fine psychotic, and the most frightening performance of all came from Michael Beach as Pluto, never breaking a sweat as he slit a throat. Paxton really carries the film, along with Ms. Williams; you really want these people to survive. Life might be like that; a great exposition of good and evil, and delivered in fine fashion by the wonderful Carl Franklin. 
Billy Bob co-wrote and stars in this tightly woven, deeply textured, well-written off-beat thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from CA to AK; combines the personal, the interpersonal, the deviant, with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle. This was on Roger Ebert's top ten list the year it came out. Although there are a couple of plot flaws, it works well enough to keep you anticipating the "showdown," because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny. This is a rare type of film nowadays: the kind that comes from the heart, not from the sterile factories of M.F.A. programs and lunkhead studios. 
i saw OFM when it first came out, over ten years back. it was on cable the other day. it still keeps me glued to the set. bill paxton, billy bob thornton, michael beach....great work. too bad this one didn't get more media and a larger audience 
M:I:3 had a tough year. It had a lot of difficulty being a satisfieing blockbuster for the moviecompangy Paramount. This had to do with Cruise's acting in his personal life which made a lot of people skip this movie. Now, I think that is totally unfair. Mission Impossible III has become a fantastic adrenaline rush, and has become the best in the series. So put aside all those thoughts about couchjumping and give M:I:3 a change, cause it highly deserves it. The third mission of special agent Ethan Hunt is both impossible as spectacular. J.J Abrams, the director, shows everything he has got and squeezes this all in a timeframe of two hours. So expect a high pace throughout the movie which gets the adrenaline pumping. But eventhough the pace is fast, this doesn't mean that there isn't any time left to meet the characters. Between the actionsequences, there are situations thats lets us know Ethan Hunt, like Abrams said, as a humanbeing, not as just a spy. This gives nice dramatic, romantic scenes which feel nessessary to catch your breath after each action sequence. Once again, put all your negative thoughts about Tom Cruise aside and then watch him. One thing is forsure: The man sure can act. He shows an emotional side to Hunt, which wasn't seen before which leads to great acting. And you gotta agree, he does most of his own stunts in the film, which is very brave and worth to see as a result in the film. Next to Cruise there is a fantastic supporting cast. In his team there is once agian, the funny and cool Ving Rhames, the sexy Maggie Q and the also funny and cool John Rhyes Meyers. They all give the film a nice sense of what real teamwork is about. Then as the badguy there is Philip Seymour Hoffman. Trust me, he does such a great job that you want to step into the screen to punch him in the face personally, thats he great he is as the bad guy. As Ethan's girlfriend there is Michelle Monaghan, who also does a good acting job, but was for me the one who was the least satisfiening. Also starring are Keri Russell, Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup and Simon Pegg (who is absolutely hilarious) who all give a nice performance. The film, considering the technical aspects, looks fantastic. Every scene looks spectacular because of the lighting, maqnificent locations and the spectacular editing. Because of this editing, the actionsscenes get even more tense than they already are, which is great entertainment of course. The locations, from Shanghai to Rome, they all look alive and are delicious eyecandy. Then there is the music that helps feeling that adrenaline pumping through your vains. So M:I:3 should have been the biggest summerblockbuster of the year, but it is a big shame that it hasn't become that. Cause with Fantastic suspence, action and alot of spectucular moviemagic, this film is worthwhile to see and makes it not impossible to be entertained to the max! 
This is a very entertaining movie with great car chase, gun fight, explosion, face off scenes and an acceptably suspenseful storyline. Good acting from Cruise and Hoffman, I must say. However, you can feel that something is missing. Scenes as memorable as those in I and II are rare, if any. The style of J.J. Abrams is much weaker than those of his predecessors. In fact, he didnt leverage on the score at all. In short, disregarding the MI label, it's still an outstanding action thriller. Recommended 
I liked but didn't love the first two MI films. The first was artsy but somewhat convoluted and not well-paced. The second was exciting to the extreme, but bloated, pretentious (e.g. the signature John Woo doves) and lacking any sort of subtlety, as we've seen in other Woo films (e.g. Face/Off). MI:3 feels completely different than its predecessors, thanks to the writing and directing of JJ Abrahms, the creator of "Alias" and "Lost." You can see his style all over this film. The best way to describe MI:3 is this: The first half is like a really, really good episode of "Alias," but with a $50 million budget. The second half is like a really, really good episode of "24", but with a $50 million budget. If you like both of these exciting TV shows, I am pretty sure you will like MI:3 a lot. I know Tom Cruise has lost of lot of folks' goodwill, with the couch-jumping hysterics, his totally out-of-line comments about Brooke Shields' post partum depression, and other high profile screw-ups. It would be totally understandable if you didn't want to bother with his films anymore. But I respectfully ask you to cut him a little slack, just for 120 minutes, just long enough to enjoy this film. It's worth it, trust me! 
This first disc on all editions of this movie on DVD includes a making-of featurette that should more than please the casual fan of the film. The second disc, exclusive to the Special Edition, goes deeper into just about every aspect of the production, I just wish they'd lower the amount of mutual "pats in the back" and "Tom does all his stunts" a bit. I guess my favorite "Mission" would be the first but all of them have great things going on for them. As action films go, they really belong at the top of the crop. the best thing going on for MI3 is Ethan Hunt's supporting team which for once work together the way they used to in the old series. I have a hard time understanding the cold shoulder audiences have given Tom Cruise over his couch-jumping thing, sure, it's hard getting excited about a Hollywood star wanting to marry for the third time but as celebrities go nowadays, it's not even worth mentioning it. This reminds me the time when James Cameron joked about being "king of the world" after winning an Oscar and people becoming bitter towards him. I guess some people don't like to see others being too happy with their lives. If Cruise follows some religion which to some of us sounds more than a bit loony, at least he hasn't done anything to attack mine like all those involved in the Da Vinci Code. At any rate, don't let the mediocre box office results of MI3 discourage you from watching it. You can see a real effort to make an outstanding film in every scene 
The great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes.The plot is easy to follow and all is the action and I think JJ abrams did a great job as director.This dvd is worth looking 
Considering all the bad press Tom Cruise and this film got earlier this year I wasn't expecting this film to be all that great. I mean, by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left. Granted, this film is not the most original of plots, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, what a great job J. J. Abrams did, and what a great cast the film had. It was much better than I expected it would be. As you watch the film, you can definitely see J. J.'s "Alias" touches all over the place. There were even a few times when I wondered if Sydney Bristow was going to jump, which would have been SO cool. Tom Cruise too a lot of crap for this film, whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics I don't know, but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish. If you're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted, M:I3 is your film 
Tom Cruise's third (and his last) Mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels. It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy&lt; It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise. It is not your father's Mission Impossible...it starts at a point towards the end and works back. The amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece. The puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwheming there are a few missteps in the action and the ploting, However Cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings. I will say Phillip Seymore Hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against Cruise's hot and cold action man. Ving Rhames is so under used in MI3. Michelle Monaghan is a star who shined as Cruise's love interest. it is a good action flick for those who crave action Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD 
Great visual of the battle where my great grandfather fought with the 6th SC. Entertaining and educational 
There is no questioning this film is done very well. That said, it should be pointed out that it may not be for everyone. If you are not a fan of cliches, stay away from this. There are TONS of monologues that go on for long periods of time with epic music in the background, and maybe not everyone can handle that. Most of the performances are incredible, my favorite happens to be Jeff Daniels. One performance that doesn't do it for me is Martin Sheen. He shares a lot of scenes with Tom Berenger and it seems like Berenger is the one keeping those scenes afloat. C. Thomas Howell has a steady part but you won't recognize him as the kid from the Outsiders. Great battle scenes, especially the big one in the open field at the end. 
After the heart-rending nobility of Abraham Lincoln's verbal tribute to Gettysburg's fallen, there is not much else that could do those men justice. Yet GETTYSBURG does so. This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history. A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle. Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College. The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance. This one is for seeing again and again, remembering, and bowing one's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood 
If you're into the Civil War, this is the movie for you. It tells the battle from both sides. It follows the activities of both sides. This is a must have for fans of the Civil War 
This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in "Gods and Generals", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case. I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end 
Almost a complete scope of the battle of the size of the battle in numbers and cause. Would have like to have heard Lincoln's Address at the end for now it is a rememberance of the dead of both sides of the battle that, I think, unitesw us now into this great nation 
This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle. I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary. It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park. When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened. Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle. These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows. As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class. When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time. Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie. Read The Killer Angels and then see this outstanding movie. Kyle Prat 
Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works. I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast. But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice. And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting. Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping. Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief. But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production. I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable. The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance. If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator. It falls a bit short of that, however. Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery. They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept. Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war. The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book. The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War. The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg. C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie. Still and all, the film is very watchable. And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film 
This movie is pure fun. My whole family loved it. It's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it's amatuer hour, but its fun to watch. We made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing. Watch it and enjoy 
This is a deliriously silly little movie, but it's fun to watch. Kim Basinger utilizes her breathtaking beauty to its fullest as she discovers the joys of becoming human, from sneezing to sex to ham and cheese on rye with mayo. Basinger's comic timing carries the movie, and even the usually disposable Dan Aykroyd's performance is comic and he and Basinger have a good chemistry. There are some delightful sequences, e.g., when Kim has to discover how to kiss, her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses, and when she has to have sex, she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all. Jon Lovitz is around for comic relief as Aykroyd's bachelor brother, and it's all mindless nonsense; it's also quite entertaining. Basinger is a blast 
The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
This is a very tedious and unfunny riff on the "fish out of water" films that were so popular in the 1980's. It is about this Major League Geek Astronomer Scientist played by Dan Aykroyd who falls in love with an Alien woman played by Kim Basinger. After watching this movie one can only come to the conclusion that good Comedic Acting is an Alien Concept to Ms. Basinger. This movie is redeemed soley by the performance of Jon Lovitch who has excellent taste in cars and is the only funny guy in this entire movie. I give this movie 5 stars because thankfully Ms. Basinger has disappeared from our screens in recent years and her real life antics are a lot funnier than this movie 
There are four movies that serve as the pentultimate example of how to effectively utilize the comedic genius of Dan Aykroyd, a man who I will remain a stalwart fan of for all of my days. The movies are "The Blues Brothers", "Trading Places", "Spies Like Us" and of course, this film. "My stepmother is an alien' is the tale of an astrophysicist(Aykroyd) who mistakenly penetrates an alien world when he sends a signal from his lab one stormy night. Soon, a beautiful denizen of that planet (Kim Basinger) arrives on earth in order to convince the scientist to send the signal again so that her world might be saved. The scientist..who is a lonely widower with a teenage daughter- falls in love with the sexy ET and marries her- thus the title. This is a fun movie, filled with top notch performances by its cast (Jon lovitz has an extremely funny early supporting role as Aykroyd's brother, and future Buffy alumnus Alyson Hannigan plays Aykroyd's daughter), and a genuinely amiable wit. The key to the film is that director Richard Benjamin understands that he has DAN AYKROYD as his star, and he plays on that. Aykroyd demonstrates such energy in this film that his performance probably WAS picked up by an alien radio in a another galaxy. His character is immediately likeable, and he plays off of Basinger very well. As the title creature, Basigner is actually quite funny and charming, and the result is a fun little picture that may not set any new standards, but nonetheless delivers the goods with a solid one-two comedic punch. This is worth many repeat viewings. Add it to your collection today 
This is just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy. The plot-an alien (Kim Bassinger) comes to Earth to study the planet and in doing so falls in love with a scientist (Dan Akroyd). But things are not all sun and fun! Dan's daughter (played by Alyson Hannigan!) suspects things are not all gravy on the home front and investigates his new love interest. Needless to say-hilarity ensues. The best part of the film is the scene when a really young Seth Green comes to take Alyson on a date. Buffy Fans!!-You'll really like seeing Seth and Alyson together. Rent the movie if you see it, you'll have a good time 
I first bought the DVD for my mother for Christmas. She let me borrow it. I am glad that I finally watched it. It is a truly great movie. It is a funny movie and very entertaining. I suggest either renting it or buying it 
this documentary takes you inside the robin hood hills case, and for me it made me doubt the outcome and imprisonment of the three teenagers. it is honest, graphic and sad, but i think it takes you inside better than most other documentaries i've seen 
Everyone should see this movie. Also, everyone should buy it so they can show it to their friends, so the word can keep spreading, and hopefully and finally, justice will be served 
This is by far the best purchase that I have ever made. I knew a lot about the case even before i saw the documentary and it even solidified my confidence in the innocence of Damien, Jason, and Jessie even more after watching the Testimony of Dale Griffis (The mail order doctor. John mark byers is full of crap and because of that he would make an excellent actor in hollywood 
One of the best documentries in its genre;"Paradise Lost" will keep you rivited till the end.And then it's not over - cause you will start thinking about what you have seen and wonder what in fact REALLY happened. I know that loads of people firmly believe in the innocence of the WM3, and I wholeheartedly support a retrail. BUT, never have I wished more for something like a "time machine" - so one can go back in history to this incident and see what the TRUTH is; to see what REALLY took place there. We must guard against the notion that the WM3 are without any blame, and keep in mind that they have troubled backgrounds. I firmly believe that someone like Damien did dabble with various cults and unsavoury influences, and I thought it was a mistake to try and deny that outright. For instance, I don't believe for one moment a rebellious teenager would change his name to Damien in honour of some priest who lived amongst lepers. That just doesnt ring true. And maybe that was their undoing - to try and paint them as misunderstood (totally) spotless youngsters. But PLEASE, I am not implying they are guilty. Not in the least. You HAVE to watch PARADISE LOST 2, once you have seen this one, as it is a compelling follow-up to this tragic story 
This film motivated me to do my own research and I read as much material on the case as I could possibly find--especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty. To be honest, I had a natural skepticism about the West Memphis Three's claims of innocence. A coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her "friends" who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder. I refused to believe it at first. But it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive. Still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends' innocence. When all is done and said - it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts. First, please allow me to correct a few misconceptions from some of the other reviewers. The Michael Moore mentioned in the credits refers to one of the little eight-year-old child murder victims, not the filmmaker. A couple of reviewers mentioned a necklace worn by Damien Echols which supposedly had blood on it from some of the victims. Actually, nothing more determinable than common blood types was found. One almost microscopic spot on the pendant was consistent with the blood type of Damien Echols (one of the accused), the other micro-spot was consistent with the blood type shared by both Jason Baldwin (one of the accused) and Steven Branch (one of the eight-year-old victims) -- as well as 11% of the rest of the Caucasian population of the United States. All experts agree that tiny micro-spots of blood can be transferred by a number of ways--especially a teenage boy wearing the necklace against their bare skin. Police photos verify that Jason Baldwin had also worn Damien's necklace. Police photos taken two days after the crime--show Damien without his shirt and reveal absolutely no cuts, abrasions or scratches whatsoever. The closest thing to credible evidence the prosecution could manage to produce were four very tiny fibers found in the houses of Damien's family and Jason's family which were deemed by the prosecution to be microscopically similar to fibers from two of the victims. But even the prosecution's expert witness, Lisa Sakevicius a criminologist from the State's Crime Laboratory acknowledged that this was inconclusive and could have just as well come from mass-produced products obtained off the shelves of the local Wal-Mart. Furthermore, Charles Linch of the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Science in Dallas refuted the claims of microscopic similarities in his testimony. No fibers whatsoever were found in the home of Jessie's family. During the appeal process forensic scientists examining the crime scene photos and autopsy photos identified human bite marks on two of the victims. This was confirmed by a forensic odontologist. Teeth impressions were taken from the three young men in prison. None of these teeth impressions from Damien, Jason and Jessie matched these bite marks found on the victims. The highly coerced "confession" from Jessie Misskelly Jr. (a 17-year-old borderline retarded boy with an IQ of 71) was so filled with obvious errors that it is an obscenity that it was treated as the basis for making these arrest. I should mention that this so-called "confession" came after submitting this boy to a 12 hour grueling without lawyers, parents or counsel of any kind and included a polygraph test which he had passed but was told by the police that he had failed. Judge Burnett would not allow the jury to hear about these interrogation techniques. Jessie Misskelly Jr. refused to testify in court against Jason Baldwin and Damien Echols stating that he simply "was not going to get up there and tell a bunch of lies". This was in spite of an offer to remove his life sentence. Read Dan Stidham's (Jessie's lawyer) case synopsis by copying and pasting the web address below: http://www.wm3.org/live/caseintroduction/synopsis_dan.php The scenario painted by the police and the prosecutors against the three teenagers is simply a scientific impossibility. How on earth could there have been the massive blood loss caused by ceremonial satanic cult killings of three persons in the middle of the night without leaving one single micro-speck of blood or any other body fluids at the scene? Did they sneak in the FBI Forensic Team to clean up after them when nobody was looking? Luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where the police had laid or transported the bodies. It should also be mentioned that none of the scarce shoe prints at the scene matched Jason, Jessie or Damien either. . For a scientific view--see this crime scene analysis and profile by one of America's leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight on who might have actually committed the crime. I must warn you - it is a bit gruesome to say the least: Copy and paste this web address: http://www.arwar.org/wm6caseinformation/Turveyequivocaldeathanalysisandprofile.html So let us briefly summarize. Much of the so-called evidence was based on the notion that Damien admitted an interest in the Wicca religion and the occult which many local people perceived as Satanism. This is not evidence of committing murder. You can go to any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere in Middle America and find plenty of books on such subjects. Furthermore, neither Jason nor Jessie had ever expressed any particular interest in Wicca or the occult. Both Damien and Jason wore mostly black clothes and loved heavy metal music. So what? The police actually confiscated 15 black T-shirts from Jason's home as evidence to prove God knows what. Damien was undoubtedly a troubled teenager from a troubled family. He was a bit of a wise-ass teenager. He wrote some morbid poetry. So what? A couple of young girls claimed months after the fact that they had heard Damien say that he committed the murders. Any reasonable-objective person listening to those testimonies would have found them implausible to put it politely. A young burglar/drug addict who was in the juvenile detention facility claimed that the shy and reserved 16-year-old Jason confessed to him the second time they ever met ghastly stories about drinking blood from the genitals of a murdered child while worshipping the devil. The counselor from that facility warned the prosecution that this young man was not credible and gave them detailed reasons. And there is no evidence that Jason and this young man ever met. Even if they did--the story is ridiculous. Still, Judge Burnett would not allow the jury to hear counter-testimony or information that could have challenged the credibility of this witness. The so-called "confession" of Jessie and the scenario put forward by the police and prosecution would have involved massive amounts of blood left at the scene. There was not even one tiny micro-spec. That is a physical impossibility. The simple fact is ALL FORENSICS were either exonerating or completely inconclusive. "There was a lack of physical evidence to tie anyone or anything to the crime scene." --John Fogleman, prosecutor of the West Memphis Three-- Sadly, the West Memphis Police would not do anything more than a cursory and disinterested investigation of the most obvious suspect. (See the forensic profile mentioned above) Probably because that obvious suspect who had a violent history including family violence and a lifetime as a penny-anny career criminal was also an undercover narcotic informant who was in a very tight relationship with the West Memphis Police. Anyway, for God sakes--see this film along with Paradise Lost 2 and read Devils Knot. . This is not a political film. This case has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, left or right or even whether you support or oppose the death penalty. I hope that we of all political persuasion agree that locking up the wrong people and letting the real killers get away is a very bad idea.

The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act, but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer, presented by material in the film, is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three. The film's strengths are that it doesn't preach, at least not in an overly wrought narrative, and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone "I hate them... I hate them and the mother's that bore them." Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No, quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time. On the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid, Jessie, with a 72 IQ, hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof, a knife found behind Damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies, and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca, he must be a Satanist. To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie, a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason, and the most important, is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera, smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them. All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other, more sinister and shocking, suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it, and terrifying to think they didn't 
This film is a good overview of the case, and primer for the book "Devil's Knot" by Mara Leveritt. It's tough to present the details in the 90 minutes or so that it runs, but it does a pretty darn good job of it. While the Echols necklace evidence isn't presented in the documentary, it should also be noted that Judge Burnett's incessant denial of every motion made by the defense, while at the same time placating the prosecution at every turn, isn't presented either. It should also be noted, for the benefit of some of the other reviewers, that the blood specimens recovered from the Echols necklace couldn't be analyzed for DNA, only blood type. One was a blood type match for Damien Echols and the other matched both Jason Baldwin and Steven Branch. It seems highly implausible that 3 young men, one mentally handicapped, could pull off this horrific crime and only leave secondary fiber transfers and a spot of blood on a necklace, (the blood type of which matched one of the alleged perpetrators and only one of the victims). If the documentary is biased, it can't begin to counter-balance the bias of the trial judge who would later also serve as the appellate judge. The documentary is gripping, but at the same time fails to show that the miscarriage of justice was almost entirely the handiwork of an anything but impartial prosecutor in robes named Judge David Burnett. You need to read the book too 
I watched this movie documentary with my husband a couple of days ago and I can't get it out of my head. It's one of the best documentaries, together with Paradise Lost 2 Revelations, I've seen. I've read lots of reviews on Amazon about what people think of these three guys and I see that lots and lots of you think that they are innocent. I just don't know what to think - this is a very difficult case. But I found some things very disturbing, like when Damien said he changed his name because of religious beliefs - I actually think it's because he's probably watched The Omen. I also think that, if they did it, that he was the leader, because when you look at Jason Baldwin when he was interviewed alone he came across as this cute boy who hasn't hurt a fly in his life - well, I sort of have my suspicions, because when you see him together with Damien he immediately starts talking like Damien and taking after him, saying the same things as Damien and laughing nervously. As for the father, I think he's innocent. I know that there have been cases when people fool a lie detector and comes out "clean", but I actually don't think he's guilty. The supportgroup that they showed in the second Paradise Lost movie Revelations has this blond woman who's talking about Damien Echols as if she's in love with him. I want to know why they didn't put the West Memphis Three through lie detectors. They should have done that from the start. I also would like to know if they knew the boys they supposedly killed, since police found fibers from the WM3 boys clothing at the crime scene. Now, what does that tell you!! I know that there are lots of people who won't agree with me on this, but this is my opinion. Also, if I was the one wrongfully accused I wouldn't sit and look like nothing happened, as I think they did. They could have at least showed some feelings. But if they are innocent, I feel very sorry for them, but I'm going the other way one this one. 
Seriously guys... if this film says ANYTHING to you, then it is your DUTY to do something... these young men were WRONGFULLY imprisoned.... Im not saying you have to donate your college fund... but atleast spread the word... tell people about www.wm3.org tell people about wm3 awareness day (July 23).. go to events... tell EVERYONE YOU KNOW about this cause.... and while you are saying "I don't have time for this" remember that what is 5 minutes to you, could help these boys have 5 minutes more of freedom.... seriously, think about it 
Great book. I can't believe that I never read it or remember reading it as a kid. I found it very entertaining. The only reason that I bought this book was because I was reading Lost in the Wilds, the true story about the kid that disappeared to Alaska by himself and ended up dying of starvation. He brought different books along and one was Call of the Wild and the other was Walden Pond. I read both try and figure out what he was thinking. 
I read it when one of my kids had to read it. A great story and brings up a lot of American history for teaching and learning (about the Gold Rush) 
The Call of the Wild The book called The Call of the Wild is a book that takes place in the north Yukon where Buck (the dog) and John live at that time. After a while when Buck and John matured they started entering the dog sledding races and winning them all. Then Buck got in a fight with the leader of the dog pack. While Sprits went for help, Buck started defending him self from this. The leader couldn't last any more so he ran away. After that they got back to the race. The story is written in first person point of view. When I was starting to read this book it felt strange and boring, because it is a book about a dog and not a person. I disliked the book at the beginning because it is boring to me, but then towards the ending the book started to be more fun and exciting for me. If you love animals or book with dogs you will totally love this book. I rate this book 4 out of 5 stars just because it is written and revolves around a dog instead a person. 
That this book is a classic should come as a surprise to no one, so my reveiw is strictly based on the audio version. I first read this novel years ago but recently listened to the tapes on a long car ride with my children. The reader did an excellent job and the story kept us all interested. I recommend this as a great way for a family to share a classic. 
Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, "Cabin Boy." It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss 
This film can be interpreted any number of ways: as a farce; a tragedy; or just plain Shakespearean comedy. Brenda Blethyn has, in the past, acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into Saving Grace with exquisite skill 
I absolutely loved this movie. It was so funny and light hearted. Craig Ferguson was very good. It is just a good movie to watch if you need a little uplift 
This is a delightful film. A very funny British comedy. Craig Ferguson, who wrote the script and co-stars, is one very creative guy. If you haven't seen it, check out the Late Late Show on CBS, which he now hosts. He is the funniest guy on late night tv, in my humble opinion. I've shared the Saving Grace dvd with a few friends and they have all loved it. Just sayin' 
This is a fall-off- the-couch funny film, and one you might as well buy, because you are going to watch it again and again for the silliness and comfort. For Craig Ferguson fans, it's a must -own. Tcheky Karyo fans will chortle as he pops up yet again where least anticipated. Newly widowed Grace (pertly played by Brenda Blethyn) finds her dissolute husband has left her nothing but debt; creditors and re-possessors now besiege her lovely Cornish seaside home. As she seeks solace in tending her greenhouse orchids, she ponders how to get out of the financial quagmire. For distraction she charitably tends to her feckless caretaker (Craig Ferguson)'s ailing personal-use cannabis plot, and a joint venture blooms. As Grace and Matthew modify the greenhouse, cultivate the crop, and go to market, hilarity, as they say, ensues. The villagers - all characters we wish were in our local pub - are perfection as they feign ignorance of the entire enterprise, while quietly lending unseen support to their beloved neighbor. No one is as he or she initially seems, and the various `reveals' in the subplots are charming and delightful. There is much 70's style stoner humor, but with an updated, wonderful, and uniquely British twist. Obligatory "locals inadvertently get stoned" sequences are not only original in their construction but, somehow, innocent and sweet. The ladies and the corn flakes scene is certainly one of the finest pieces of physical comedy ever put on film. And as the story progresses, it evolves from a tale of potentially puerile marijuana mishaps to, instead, one of the power of love and redemption as Grace and Matthew each find their salvation in the unfolding of a future neither of them foresaw. The ending is pure bliss, and an absolute upper. Get it. You'll be delighted. 
This movie has it all, especially for baby boomers of the early 1970's. Blethyn, as a betrayed widow is priceless and Nigel Ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks. The English scenery is charming and Blethyn's loyal village friends top off the movie's touching humor and happy ending. I have given this DVD as Christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too. A MUST OWN 
This is a must see movie for lovers of British comedy. This movie had me in stitches. In short, the plot of the movie is about a widow trying to raise money to pay off the debt her husband left her. How does she go about the task? By growing pot. Lots of laughs to be had. 
This is the very best series I've ever seen. It is addictive in the best possible way 
I LOVE everything about this movie. It has a way of showing how people will help each other, even if it means going to extremes (I don't want to give away the movie plot). It has it's laughs and tears and frustrations. It was through this movie that I discovered Craig Ferguson. I highly recommend it. It has a happy ending too 
I loved this movie right from the start. Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn are wonderful together, and some of the scenes of little old ladies geting (unknowingly) giggly on "tea" are just a hoot. I'd always liked Craig Ferguson as Mr Wick on the "The Drew Carey Show", and it's nice to see that there is so much more to him than just that character. 
I can't stop watching this documentary about the recording of the cast ablum of a wonderful musical Broadway show. And I found watching the film with the commentary was as entertaining as watching the movie without the talking heads. The film quality of the transfer to DVD isn't perfect, but it's a minor flaw. To top it off, you listen to great songs by the great Stephen Sondheim. I fully recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the documentary about Bob Dylan, "Don't Look Back," which was made by D.A. Pennebaker as well. Pennebaker just records what's in front of him and let's everything play out without manipulation. It's pure and simple and top-notch filmmaking 
If you like Broadway, if you like Stephen Sondheim (or even if you don't), if you like behind-the-scenes looks at show business, you'll probaby like this DVD. It's a documentary of how the original cast recording of Company was put together a few days after the show opened in New York. All one Sunday and through 4 a.m. Monday the tracks were rehearsed, changed, critiqued, redone until with one exception the record was finished. The exception was Elaine Stritch's recording of the big song from the show, "The Ladies Who Lunch." It's a dramatic show stopper, and Stritch just couldn't nail it. All the other cast members had been dismissed, so it was just Stritch, the orchestra, and the recording and creative teams. The more takes they took, the more flaccid her performance became and more tired her voice sounded. This section alone on the DVD is high drama. (They finally recorded the orchestra track and had her come back two days later--when she did nail it, to everyone's relief.) The program takes less than an hour and there's no voice over (unless you access a fairly interesting interview made 30 years later by Stritch, Harold Prince, the show's Broadway director, and Pennebaker). You move from song to song seeing how adjustments were made, how help was given, how nuances became highly important. Interspersed are snippets of discussion by Sondheim and Prince of how the show came about. Everyone was acutely aware that they were making the permanent recording of the show's score. The stress, no matter how professional the actors were, had to have been incredible. There's Dean Jones with a fairly brittle voice who was probably chosen for the lead because of his movie name recognition. He clearly looks uncomfortable throughout. At one point the recording supervisor, Thomas Z. Shephard, says to him, "You're very good and I don't want to spoil something that's potentially marvelous..." Uh oh. Pamela Meyers was a young singer in her first Broadway show with a big song to perform, "Another Hundred People." She looks a bit like Brigitte Jones. Sondheim works with her to get a single note where it should be. She is so serious listening to him and he takes the time to be gentle with her. And there's Stritch, an actress who seems unable to turn it off. She draws the center of attention to her just enough to be noticeable. Most things tend to be dramatic with her, and her struggle with "Ladies" is as much self-involved as it is her aiming for excellence. I'm not one of those who thinks a great deal of Company as a show. I've seen it on Broadway and two or three times in rep. It's a musical about marriage and relationships and the inability to commit...or rather, it's a story about relationships and marriage amongst rather superficial upper-East Side New Yorkers. Those are easy targets and the point of view gets, for me, a little tiresome. But the songs are great, and the show was exciting and different when it opened. As I said, if you like Broadway musicals, Steven Sondheim, and behind-the-scenes looks, you'll probably get a kick out of this. 
Company is, to say the least, an unusual show. What is it, really? Certainly a brilliant musical, by Stephen Sondheim. But it's taken a very special place in Broadway Lore, thanks in great part to the Cast Album that was recorded in front of D.A. Pennebaker's cameras. If you're an aficionado of Broadway, you already know a lot about Sondheim. So, it's fascinating to see the young composer coaching his singers and consulting with the recording engineers during this marathon session from 1971. It's a truly exciting and vibrant look at the process, shot entirely hand-held, with raw focusing and close ups on the vocalists. The performances are for the microphones, not the lenses, so you see quite a few candid moments throughout the evening, and this gives the film a heightened intensity, and even moreso because the whole thing runs just under an hour. Still, if you have played and played the cast album, it's very refreshing to see the alternate takes shown here. Dean Jones emoting on "Being Alive" is as incredible a performance as you'll ever view, and Elaine Stritch's "Ladies Who Lunch" recording is the lynchpin on which this whole film is hung. My only complaint about this DVD is the "commentary" track. Granted, this commentary track was done particularly well. Some statements were clearly scripted, like the ones that filmmaker Pennebaker makes at the opening. Also commenting are Hal Prince, Broadway Director extraordinaire, who has some interesting insights and Elaine, the superstar diva, just being her gabby self. They carefully drop comments in where it doesn't take away from the original interview moments in the film, and there's a minimum of rambling, which is all too typical of such tracks on other DVDs. But the fact is, this commentary track should have been a complete and separate interview section, perhaps gathering a few more of the participants, and sitting them down in a room for a chat. It would have been another chance for Pennebaker to roll more film in revisiting this alchemical moment in time. Ah well, there's very little to complain about here! If you're even mildly interested in documentary filmmaking, Broadway shows, Cast Albums or Sondheim, you know what you must do: Get this disc! Highly Recommended 
This DVD is a valuable piece of Broadway history, as it documents the process involved in recording one of the landmark cast albums of all time, "Company". It is interesting to see the mechanics involved, naturally, but what sticks with you is the determination of these tired actors (they recorded on the Sunday after opening night, their day off) to get a permanent record of this brilliant, groundbreaking musical. It's fun to watch them subtly interact as if on stage. It's also touching to see these actors as they looked thirty-four years ago-- Barbara Barrie before her harrowing cancer battle, Beth Howland and Charles Kimbrough before sitcom fame, Elaine Stritch before England, marriage, widowhood, and beating alcoholism. The intriguing backstage story of lead actor Dean Jones' impending departure from the show is still moving; his misery over a crumbling marriage back in California led to a deal with director Harold Prince to bring the show into New York-- then to leave the role to Larry Kert. Certainly there are some wonderful performances captured here (Dean Jones, Teri Ralston's silvery vocals, Beth Howland's hysterical patter song, Pamela Myer's run through of what may be the greatest song written about New York, "Another Hundred People"). But the centerpiece is indeed Elaine Stritch's struggle to get a good track down of what she has called her "three-act play", "The Ladies Who Lunch". On that memorable first night, her fatigue gets the better of her and nuance gives way to angry shouting. Her eyes, wide and wild with exhaustion, tell volumes. Her quiet, dignified exit to get rest while the orchestra records the backing track is pure theatre. And her triumphant return to the studio to nail the perfect take (indeed, the film documents the take that actually made the album) thrills. She must have known this would be "the one", as she made sure her hair was done and her makeup perfect (down to full false eyelashes)-- she looks beautiful and sounds spectacular. Stritch's present-day commentary protests that she had a matinee later that day, hence the full stage face. Whatever the reason, her tough-as-nails beauty shines. The DVD's extras add a fun commentary (by Pennebaker, Hal Prince and a typically feisty Stritch) and photos from the original production-- I wish they had added more! This is very much worth it if you are a student of theatre history or of theatre music 
GAWD!  Just watch her do take after take .... and then that MAGNIFICENT EXIT ... only to return later to complete the session and BLAST 'EM AWAY!  SO? Name an Award after her, a Thetare ...? A Lane next to a Theatre?  ENOUGH GUSHING ... a brilliant DVD ... the rest ? Incomparable.. With this DVD youget exactly what's expected - professionals - over the course of a gruelling sesssion [schedules ya know] creating perfection under the auspices of masters! One for all the ages 
Stephen Sondheim's "Company" was a revolutionary show in the American Musical Theatre - not unlike "Show Boat," "Porgy and Bess," "Oklahoma" and "West Side Story." It broke new ground and expanded the medium. It set a higher standard. Considering Sondheim's genius it isn't possible to label a single score his "best" or his "masterpiece." Truly, when you listen to the various and varied Sondheim scores one inevitably thinks "this is the greatest of his achievements" - which is only true until you listen to the next score and find yourself having the same thought. This DVD offers a unique look behind the scenes of the recording of the "Company" album. All of the best remembered songs from the score are represented - "You Could Drive a Person Crazy," "Another Hundred People," "The Little Things You Do Together, "Being Alive" and the incomparable "The Ladies Who Lunch" featuring Elaine Stritch's knock-out performance. If you love Sondheim or Stritch or the American Musical, you shouldn't be without this DVD. Order it now 
Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) is on a downward slide as an ambulence-chasing alcoholic lawyer when his associate (Jack Warden) tries to slap him out of his stupor in order to remind him that he is throwing away an opportunity to get back on his feet. Galvin starts going through the motions of collecting information about a case that involves a young child-bearing woman who suffered brain damage as a result of being given the wrong anaesthesia. Some of his old fight comes back to him when he starts to realize the negligence involved, and before he has thought much about it, he starts on the path of what he takes to be doing the right thing. But doing the right thing can be a formidible undertaking. He had once lost a prestigious job and his wife had divorced him after he tried to do right thing. Now, as he struggles to clear out the cobwebs, before he realizes it, he has managed to alienate almost everyone, including his previously very trusting clients, and faces almost all by himself a power structure that is aware of and capable of subverting his every move. The judge (Milo O'Shea) is always eating in his chambers, the defense attorney (James Mason) and his legions of lawyers are constantly winking and nodding at each other: they are like caricatures used as devices to condense the viciousness of self-interest. The greatness of this film especially concerns the script and the acting force of Paul Newman. The contrast is striking between the muddled, uncertain man on the verge of being a complete failure and the flashes of brilliance that he shows as he fights with his back against the wall. Some of the oratory has a Shakespearian quality to it 
Man this movie rocks. Paul neuman is an acting God that should have more Oscars then Jack nickleson. It's a great dark flm that no one should miss 
That was Paul Newman's response to Jack Warden, as Warden massages Mr. Newman's back and tries to assuage him by telling him there will be other cases. ( Pardon me, I always wanted to use the word ASSUAGE in a review ). I live in Connecticut, and my wife and I drive thru Westport regularly, on our way to Trader Joe's. I know exactly where Mr. Newman lives,( I'll never tell ) and I always kid to my wife, " I wonder what Paul is doing today? " Then I jokingly say that maybe we'll see him at Trader Joe's ( grocery store ) or at Mario's ( great place for lunch or dinner). Of course if I ever did actually meet him, I'd be stammering and babbling just like Jackie Gleason used to do in his old Honeymooner's television show. But enough of my dreaming. So, how was the movie? Sometimes there are events or moments in a movie that stay with you for a long time. In this movie, those times were: " There are no other cases..This is the case! " and the confrontation Mr. Newman had with the judge, when he proclaims, " I know about you! " as he taps his fingers on the judge's desk. Classic moments. If I ever had a chance to become an actor, and had my pick of acting coaches, one of them would be Paul Newman. I'm not sure how he does it, but somehow, after watching him on screen for a few moments, I forget he is Paul Newman, and believe he is the character he is portraying.I guess that's the " magic " of great acting. They make it look so effortless. And now onto Jack Warden. He is perhaps one of the most under-rated actors in history. A great performance from a great actor. Back to Paul Newman. The next time you watch one of his movies, watch the pauses...the times when he's not speaking. It's the entire package that makes an actor great. It's the phrasing, the reaction, the eye movements, the pauses and how long he holds them. ( Sure the director has a lot of input too)- but just watch him. What you are witnessing is a STAR in action. As I write this ( June 29, 2006 ) Paul Newman is 81 years old. He may be a little slower, a little more wrinkled, but his acting just gets better with age. ( Watch Empire Falls ). I truly hope he makes more movies. And who knows, perhaps one day I WILL run into him at Trader Joe's or Mario's place. And in true Jackie Gleason form, say to him, " Hubba, Hubba, Hubba. " And that, my friends, will be no act.  
His words to the jury, a petition for strength for them against great odds, for himself against greater odds, for a system sometimes blind to justice, and for the victim of negligence who has no voice, puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'The Verdict.' TV bytes and news reports of lawyers' greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best. And the courage and brilliance of "Brown v. Board" and "Heart of Atlanta" exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past. But once in while a movie ('Mockingbird') comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession: to do what is right, or even better, to do what is right against great odds. Frank Galvin, drunk, ambulance chaser, liar, failure, had that dream once but a mistake, an error of judgemnt, a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now, sucking on breath mints and bourbon, handing out cards, working for booze money. His old friend Jack Warden handed him a case, a no-brainer, a lovely Irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead. The Defendants? A squeaky clean, Chaired, lauded, published and handsome OBGYN and . . . . the Diocese of Boston. And Frank's going to cave. Hell. It's the eve of trial and he's been drunk through the 24 months of discovery. And then he prepares for the Settlement Conference with the Dfense Lawyer, James Mason (just positively brilliant) and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos. But a funny thing happens. Lke Marcellus (Burton) winning the Robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first AA meeting, Frank's not sure but something's different. And he begins to wonder if maybe this time he won't cave. Great, morbid, wry, ironic, gallows humor. Warden says after the Settlement Conference, "whadja' think of (Mason)?" Galvin: He's good. Warden: Good? He's the [. . . . .] Prince of Darkness. A cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief. I don't know that there is a better trial movie. People say that Newman lost but wasn't robbed for the Oscar because Ben Kingley was so wonderful in Ghandi. He was robbed. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury 
Paul Newman is great as a despairing, alcoholic "David", once second in his law class, once part of a prestigious law firm, once married...till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury. The above is past history...just mentioned in the film. It is some years after, and alcoholic Newman, with only 4 cases in the last few years, ...has an epiphany...where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens as he gets the picture, so to speak, of a woman treated unjustly, whom he can help. He forgets himself and his troubles, and the people who have pushed him around, ...and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman...against the hospital and doctors who damaged her. He will later awaken the conscience (as the movie hints) of one of the "Goliaths" he goes up against. However, there are pitfalls... as opposing lawyer Concannon is not above using any trick---or person...to destroy the case. Paul Newman's epiphany scene (which I won't describe further to spoil it for you, but which is clearly recognizable) is quite moving. His Goliaths include: The biased, hostile Judge, the "Prince of Darkness" superlawyer Concannon (played well by James Mason, always good at suave villians), the doctors and **most** of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate Deborah Ann Kaye, ...and the somewhat hesitant Bishop Brophy, head of St. Catherine's, the hospital where Mrs. Kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage. Set in Boston, a largely Catholic city (I am told) we here have nominal Catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the Christian "Good Samaritan" story seriously. My family caution: There are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene.  The Verdict implies the barely seen 12 who also are key players...the jury, who must deliver the verdict. Will they go with the letter of the law? Or---its spirit? (If you are familiar with this phrase from the Christian faith, you have the answer...) (Hint of spoiler below) My wish is that brain injured Terri Schiavo had had a jury who could see the spirit of the law!  Instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a Congress that dared (how DARE they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude) to merely ask for a second look at the whole case. Meanwhile, Terri slowly starved to death...Shame on us! Shades of Nazi Eugenics!!! 
a very powerful performance film by both paul newman and jack warden a film of the past delivers jack warden was underrated but in this film he certainly gives his bst paul newman was always an excellent acto 
A searing, moody courtroom drama masterfully directed by Sidney Lumet, the film earned five Oscar nominations in 1982, including one for writer David Mamet. As Frank Galvin, Newman shows a rare vulnerability as a man struggling to redeem himself before it's too late. This film represents both courtroom and human drama at its finest, with veteran player Jack Warden superb as Galvin's only colleague and friend. 
This is one of those mystery/suspense movies that I can watch over and over because it is so well made. "The Verdict" stars Paul Newman in one of his best roles. It was a tough year for Best Actor Oscar in 1982 but it's still a shame he didn't win it then. He plays a ambulance-chasing attorney who spends too much time drinking his lunch and too little researching his limited work. A friend of his with some connections steers a fairly routine lawsuit his way but even that case he manages to mess up. Having tossed away a large out-of-court settlement, he now has to make his case against a well-staffed powerful opponent. That's probably more of the plot than needs to be revealed so I'll leave it at that. Like most excellent movies, "The Verdict" combines excellent writing directing and acting. The supporting cast includes great preformances by James Mason and Jack Warden. There are twists and turns as the movie evolves into a great courtroom drama. Newman is outstanding in his portrayal of a man who suddenly realizes that he is about to blow his last chance at making something of his life. The writer and director gave him the opportunity and he delivered with a home run. This is one of those movies that would be enjoyable for all but the very young. If you haven't seen it yet, then it's about time. 
Paul Newman plays a Boston lawyer on the skids with alcohol who takes on a negligence case against two prominent doctors and a hospital run by the Boston Archdiocese. It's a sort of do-or-die case for Newman, and it goes pretty badly against him, until he is able to get the help of one of the nurses who was in the operating room when the negligence took place. It's pretty much a one-man show for Newman, and he does a bang-up job. We can see into his character thoroughly, and it's not all goody-goody idealism: after he's turned down a $210,000 "payoff" (out-of-court settlement) thinking he has a chance to win, and then his chief witness is bought off, we see him try desperately to get the settlement money back. The trial is pure Hollywood, with the judge, too, against him, and Newman winning the jury over with a plea for compassion and doing right. Jack Warden does a good job as Newman's senior partner and mentor, as does James Mason as the suave and wily defense lawyer. But Charlotte Rampling is a total non-entity as the double-dealing woman who falls in the sack with Newman. There's much hokum and predictability here, but Newman is so good he makes the movie hum. Definitely worth a watch 
Hilarious movie!! Dustin Hoffman and Jason Schwartzman were incredibly funny. If you're a fan of existentialism it's a great movie, but if you're not it is still worth seeing 
This movie is obviously not for everyone. It's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour's. Nope, instead you get the muscle a-cranking. Huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in. This film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart, soul, and body of every other thing in existence in an ever-changing world. This film is a big orgy of questioning. And who doesn't like questioning? This film, in its own right, is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films. "Huckabees" offers us an impressive cast with Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Mark Wahlberg, Isabelle Huppert (one of my favorite international actress's) and Naomi Watts. Most notable performances by, namely, Dustin Hoffman as it's nice to see him in an exceptional role. He hasn't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997's "Wag the Dog." It's very nice to see Hoffman play a great character, as Bernard, the quirky husband half of the existential detectives. Also, most notable is the performance of Mark Wahlberg, as Tommy Corn, another client of the detectives that befriends Albert. Tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather, rides a bike to the fire saying, "We'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum." Mark Wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably "Boogie Nights" and "Three Kings." However, this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else. The ensemble's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless. The most credit to this movie goes to writer/director David O. Russell. Russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story. But the story is amazingly written. The script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that. 
...the most original screenplay since Citizen Kane. At least that's my take. How do I describe this movie? I can't. It's bizarre in the extreme, but I mean that in a good way. It's like nothing you've ever seen before. It takes screenwriting to a new level. Maybe that sounds a tad pretentious, but sorry, it's true. I can't imagine how they sold it. To the suits, I mean. I can't even imagine how the script reads, how one can make sense of it on paper. But I'm glad someone did, because the result was a stunningly-original film. But how do I describe it? I can't. I'm not the only one with this problem. I read the back of the box in the video store: it made no sense. I read some capsule summaries on the Internet Movie Database: they made no sense either. It's very stream-of-conscious, proceeds more by gut instinct than by logic. Basically, but not entirely, I [Heart] Huckabees is a philosophical discourse where the various existential elements are personified and characterized. And these existential elements get into arguments with each other. If you're the type of person who thinks matters of importance through only to have your own brain argue with itself, to hear little voices competing for your psyche's attention, then you'll understand this movie. If you aren't that type of person, you may find yourself, like many (Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli) feeling on the outside, frustrated that you can't crack the code and get "into" this movie. From the first frame I had no trouble identifyinjg with these extremely strange situations. But many will, and it's understandable. I'll skip all the obvious jokes about how maybe the right drugs will help. This movie is like a drug. And you may have a bad reaction to it. Or not. But how do I describe it? I can't. Just rent it. The performances are a joy, except maybe oddly for Dustin Hoffman, who never really seems to find a unique voice to match his unique haircut. Paired with Lily Tomlin, she blows him off the screen seemingly without trying. Jason Schwartzman and Mark Wahlberg are wonderful as the screwball main protagonists--Schwartzman in particular shines in this sort of offbeat role. Isabelle Huppert made me laugh just by her what-is-she-doing-here presence, but I couldn't tell you why. Ditto Naomi Watts. You can read all the reviews you want of this film, but they won't do it justice. You'll either hate it or it will blow your mind. Ebert didn't like it, but he didn't like Brazil either, and for many the same reasons. For him, neither film "made sense." For me, they come from deep within our psyches, and owe more to the irrational than to anything in the neocortex. How well you respond to either might be determined by your imagination, how far it can go, how many different ways you can see something. But how do I describe it? I can't. Go see it. 
"I Heart Huckabees" is the ultimate love it / hate it movie. Few will say, "I could either go see 'I Heart Huckabees' or whatever else is playing at the multiplex." Me? I loved "I Heart Huckabees." I loved it so much I can't even review it. I loved every performance, every line of dialogue; I loved it so much I want to form a club with others who loved this movie ... Normally, I can't stand Jason Schwartzman, and even he didn't ruin it for me. How can you tell which camp you'll fall into? Here's a test. Agree or Disagree with the following statements: 1.) My friends and family tell me I think too much, and that my life would be much easier if I would just relax and not rock the boat. 2.) I've tried meditation, but gotten sidetracked when I found myself imagining taking a machete to people who annoy me. 3.) I could pick Franz Kafka out of a line-up that included Jean Paul Satre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Buster Keaton. 4.) The thought of sex with a nihilist leaves me contemplating nothingness, and yet strangely aroused. 5.) I've always wanted to see Marky Mark bicycle in fireman's knee-high rubber boots, while protesting the world petroleum crisis. 6.) I once lost a girlfriend / boyfriend to someone who was cover-model pretty / handsome, but had no soul, and that, yet again, caused me to think too much, and then to meditate, and then to imagine the whole machete thing. 7.) I think that the objectification of women is shallow and obscene, and Amish bonnets turn me on. 8.) Dustin Hoffman does a faux friendly, "I've got your nuts in my cracker" smile better and better as he ages. 9.) Lily Tomlin is reason enough to see any movie. 10.) Cruely, Manipulation, Meaninglessness. Give yourself as many points as you want for each "yes" answer, and then give yourself an equal number of points for each "no" answer. Cause, you know? It's all one. 
This has become one of my favorite movies of late. Will I always love it? Not sure, but for now its the sort of film that I can watch and watch again. Many other reviewers have noted that much of the interest of the film is intellectual, in fact that the comedy, however sophmoric from one perspective, depends upon an intelectual underpinning that is probably not shared by most viewers. And I agree. Trust me, there is much more than the surface farce going on here. I would note that many of the other reviewers seem over focused on Existentialism as a philosophical school. I think this is taking the notion of "existential detective" too narrowly. In fact, the greatest philosophical influence in the film seems to me to be Buddhism, which the director has a long involvement with. I once recommended the film to a fellow teacher as a textbook intro to Zen. The on-going tension between the affirmative vision of totality and the nihilistic vision captures a Zen motif, as does the "sudden enlgihtenment" of the balloon scene. I could go one in great detail. Nor do I think that the film is simply making fun of intellectuals or philosophical seekers; it is far more subtle than that. Suffice it to say that for me the film is powerfully moving, even uplifting, at the same time that it acknowledges the "manure of human existance". I doubt that the real difference between those who "get it" and those who hate it is intellectual per se ( a number of "students of philosophy" posting here hated the film). Its more a matter of one's sense of life, one's attitude towards it: a passion for the depths, for complex thought, and at the same time a joy in the simple, including the simple truth of one's own limitations. Not a film for those too serious to see their own absurdity, nor for those uninterested in taking the time to look beyond the absurd to the serious 
If you liked amelie , this one is definitely for you... a good movie , that you can see to many times , every time you will unsertand a diferent thing... 
Crude language, Wild philosophy taken to an extreme. The attitudes and language are what makes this movie rated R. Even though it may seem like all fun and games, and you may not want to say otherwise, you know it's more than that. Looking at the title, it sounds like it could be another comedic happy go lucky film. Right about the comedic part, but so wrong on everything else. There are hearts broken in ways you wouldn't have imagined, two Huckabee models and "everything else Huckabees." Jason Schartzman plays the main character, and I found out that he's the drummer in Phantom Planet, a great pop band! (I hear he's arrogant though, and this fact only would enhance it.) Dustin Hoffman and Jude Law are in it. Mark Wahlberg is truly convincing in this one. If you like South Park, Daria, or any kind of toilet humor, this movie may just be for you 
before i even get into my glowing review of this cult classic horror film,i want to call a long overdue moratorium on the long winded, synopsis-heavy reviews, people read these to glean opinions and REVIEWS of the film from like minded genre fans, the brief, succinct synopsis that amazon provides is enough to allow the reader to decide if he wants to check out the film, the poorly written synopses are useless, time consuming, and they take up space. you didn't write the film, so chill out with the play by play, please. anyway, that having been said, this is pure, cheesy, schlocky 80's horror, all the elements are there: bad special effects that elicit instant laughs, a dorky horror freak best friend(who bears a resemblance to paul from the wonder years), a saucy older sister with even saucier friends, and a young, baby faced stephen dorff looking scared and perplexed for most of the film, a far cry from his cocky, arrogant, james dean/vampire turn as deacon frost in 1998's Blade. the final sequence, with the giant demon rising from the hole, is actually pretty impressive, at least for a film made in that era. worth buying. the dark poe 
I saw this movie. The things that sitck out for me is the Barbie doll to the eye and the dead workers in the wall. It has a cult-flick feeling to it. And for some reason I'll always love this flick 
After I saw this film, I went in my backyard and tried digging, then my mom yelled at me. Now I'm older and I am going to order this DVD. The movie is awesome, it's a classic in my mind 
I have yet to see this movie as an adult, but i remember being aroung the age of 8 and being allowed to watch this by an uncle of mind babysitting one night, and i about wet myself. Nightmares were a regular occurance after that night. I'm sure as an adult that ill wonder what i was thinking back then, but if you are looking for a movie with effects before its time, this is the one. Great film 
get this one! I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend but after only maybe 10-15 minutes I was really interested in seeing what happened next. I have been forced to watch a few other romance films in my time and this one I actually enjoyed. If your girl has given you a list of romance movies she wants for gifts and you know your going to end up having to watch them with her, do yourself a favor and get this 
ok even for a guy, I thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth, but to my amazement I thought is was a great story and lived up to all that I have reviewed. I would suggest the movie to all. 
The notebook is a touching fantastic movie about a love that I find truelly incredible. I have watched it several times and I cry each and every single time. The actors are really good, I am a big fan. A movie to see, unlike any love storie you have seen or heard about 
My wife is a fan of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams and asked me to purchase the DVD. In addition to the movie, the Director's comments on the making of the movie, deleted scenes, etc.,in the Platinums series are all very worthwhile attachments to this "fairy tale" love story 
This is one of the better movies I've seen in quite awhile. It is a love story, but not your typical love story. The love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from Alzheimers. The biggest selling point of the cast is Ms. Rachel McAdams. I saw her in WEDDING CRASHERS and I've been anxious to see more of her work. She is gorgeous AND she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie. I predict her as one of Hollywood's up coming stars (at least I hope so!). For a guy whose father suffers from Alzheimers, this movie really hit home. An interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young (their courtship) and the period of their Golden Years. This is a must-see movie, even for people who don't normally care for "mushy" movies. In a single word, this story is unforgettable. 
This is a love story personified. And I am sure this goes on in real life every minute of every day. This is what LOVE really is. . . . in sickness and in health till death us do part. And I do not believe it ends there. So if you want to know what LOVE really is - watch this movie or read the book. It is fantastic 
I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way. This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie. The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie. I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical "boy loves girl" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre. The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the "rich man" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many "cliches" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie. It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time. Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy 
I'm an avid reader, always have been, but I've felt kind of burned out of reading as of late, and who wouldn't be after reading hundreds and hundreds of books, one after another, usually reading two books at a time, several books a week? Also, my schedule no longer allows me the freedom to read as much as I used to. And that is why I decided to watch this film when Netflix sent it to me despite the fact that I hadn't read the Nicholas Sparks novel first. Now I wish I'd read the book. This is one of the most beautiful tear-jerking stories I have seen! Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for stories that pull at the heart strings. They also know that stories centered on star-crossed lovers are my major weakness. Most of my all-time favorite books and movies have those characteristics in common. I won't go into details about the plot because I don't want to give away spoilers to potential viewers (though I'm sure many people have done that already) -- all I can say is that you cannot go wrong with this film if you're a hopeless romantic. The actors are wonderful. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams transmit all of the right emotions and do a flawless job with the characterization. They add a great deal of depth and range to their characters and I can't imagine better actors for the roles. Gena Rowlands is also wonderful as the older Allie. And I like the 1940s setting and the backdrop -- however brief -- of the second world war. The wardrobe, settings, scenery and cinematography are flawless. The DVD is a great investment. The widescreen edition makes viewing all the more pleasurable. I cannot recommend The Notebook enough. I don't know if I'll read the book because I don't like reading novels after I have watched their film adaptations, but I will definitely read other Nicholas Sparks novels in the not-so-distant future 
Had seen the movie on STARZ but enjoyed it so much I wanted it in my library. Good Chick flick, somewhat of a tear jerker, but good none the less 
I love this movie! Yes, it is an unabashedly romantic, chic-flick tearjerker (but hey, you're talking to someone whose top 10 favorite all-time movies include Somewhere in Time and 1994's Little Women). I won't rehash the plot, but let me mention my favorite thing about this movie (I plan on reading Nicholas Sparks' novel someday when my schedule is less hectic)...unconditional, undiminished love. What a beautiful gesture for the elderly Noah to spend all day reading "The Notebook" in order to get his wife back for just a few minutes. When Allie becomes herself again, she asks, "How long do we have?" The lovers know that they only have a few hard-won minutes before dementia takes Allie away again. If ever two people were soul mates, it would be Noah and Allie, from their love spats as youngsters to their deep mutual devotion until the end of their lives. The acting was great, and I was impressed with the range of Rachel McAdams. I kept thinking, that girl looks really familiar, until I realized she had been Regina in Mean Girls. I look forward to renting A Message in the Bottle soon. Nicholas Sparks must understand his female audience very well--we love stuff like this! Keep it coming!!!  
Longer ago than I care to remember I had the great fortune to meet Einstein. I was an under grad in college when he made one of his unannounced visits to the campus. Walter Matthau captures the professor briliantly and his humor and wit come through in this film. Einstein's interest in motorcycles and his love of sailing are portrayed lovingly and the very human side of the great man is illustrated with fidelity and humor. It is always on my list of ten favorite films. 
This film is light and fun, well acted and knows what it is. A film that doesn't take itself seriously yet does present a convincing love story in a beautiful setting with a fun take on an historical figure. And I might only give it 4 stars, but it gets the extra star for showcasing the beauty of... New Jersey. My home state gets a bad rap, and this film shows just how lovely much of the state truly is. While it's meant to take place in the 50s, the scenery is still there and still beautiful. Oh, and one other thing that makes it a five... As a man, this is one of those "chick films" that I'll gladly watch with my girlfriend. It's Meg Ryan at her cutest, and Tim Robbins is weird enough looking that I look pretty good in comparison. This movie helps perpetuate the myth that goofy looking guys without much to offer can attract smart, attractive women, and hey, what's wrong with that? ; 
If you want something simple and entertaining, this just fits the bill. As a sidenote, for all of those who know Tony Shalhoub as Monk, will find it ironic that he plays an auto mechanic whose hands are always dirty. 
Official Meg Ryan Movie Disclaimer: If you love Meg Ryan when she's playing the "quintessentially Meg Ryan" character -- slightly ditzy, girl next door, all eyes and smiles for miles -- you'll adore this film and must own it post haste! That said -- this is a larky, improbable, at times almost too cute vehicle for her charms, and those of the (who knew?) equally daffily appealing Tim Robbins, who can play crazy, tender, and smart like nobody's business. Here he's a grease monkey full of heart, a little light in the cranium but fascinated by the gee-whiz, pre-lunar landing stuff of 1950's American pop pulp science. She's Einstein's brainy niece in the of Sandra Dee, all white gloves and sparkly eyes, Doris Day suits and brisk, collegiate sexiness. Walter Matthau's turn as Albert the Immortal is a bit heavy handed, but he's the zip and zing which makes this improbable romance "go" ... he and his band of fellow doddering professorial brainiacs, who relish rock and roll and fast cars, badminton and cardigans. Brilliant Brit Stephen Fry brings heavy comic gravitas to his role as Catherine's fiancee, a plummy sounding gent who calls her munchkin and is so pre-occupied with his lab rats and the color of the paint for the new home he's planning to provide for his amore that he misses the point entirely: it's about love, stupid! Not an Academy Award calibre movie, I.Q., but not a bad way to pass the better part of a morning or an afternoon either. Incurable romantics, this movie was made for people like us. Cynics, take a pass ... and pass the sweet peas 
I.Q. is a pleasant romantic comedy with a twist - the uncle of the young woman the story is about is none other than the great genius Albert Einstein (played brilliantly by the late great Walter Matthau). Set in the late fifties, the story begins when Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) and her fiance James (Stephen Fry) experience car trouble while riding around in his MG, and seek assistance at a garage. The garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), sees Catherine and falls hopelessly in love with her. Of course, Ed's aspirations seem to be hopeless. Ed is a very good car mechanic but has no formal college education. But in the spirit of all romantic comedies, Ed feels that the relationship has a chance if he can only meet her and spend some time with her. When she accidentally leaves her pocket watch at the gas station, he seizes the opportunity to try and see her again by personally returning the watch. Imagine his surprise, when he knocks on the door and Albert Einstein answers. Surprisingly, Ed and Professor Einstein hit it off immediately. Ed is no scientific genius, but he understands human nature and the importance of having fun in life, two things that Einstein feels are lacking in his niece's life, which has been largely based on trying to emulate her uncle. Einstein is getting on in years and wants to make sure that she is happy and will be looked after properly. When Ed expresses the depth of his feeling, Einstein vows to help set things up. Einstein and his physicist friends -who also dote on Catherine-, decide to try and set Ed and Catherine up as a favor to both of them. It turns out that the car mechanic pretends to be an amateur physicist to impress Meg Ryan. Ed -allegedly- develops a process to use cold fusion to power a spacecraft, which during the cold war and the space-race was extremely important. However, this process didn't exist, Catherine finds out that Ed is a fraud and Ed realizes that he must level with her if they are ever to have a true relationship. The clever and romantic ways that these issues are resolved by Einstein and his cronies and by Ed and Catherine themselves make up the remainder of the story.  The highlight of I.Q. has to be the performance of Walter Matthau as Einstein. He has created an original character that seems totally different from the kind of roles he always played with Jack Lemmon. Ed and Catherine are engaging as the young lovers and give us good on-screen chemistry, like they were meant for each other. While this film is by nature light and predictable, you will find it quite enjoyable entertainment. One of my favorite lines from the movie is in a dialogue between Albert Einstein and Tim Robbins' character Ed. They are discussing how to get Catherine to go out with Ed since Catherine will only go out with intellectual types.  Einstein: "The problem is she would never go out with a guy like you." Ed: "Well that's easy. Lend me your brain for a while." Einstein: "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" Ed: "Now what are the odds of that happening?" 
This movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy. The cast is great. Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) the Garage Mechanic falls in love at first sight of Catherine(Meg Ryan) when she appears at his Gas Station with a failing car with her pretentious fiance James Mooreland (Stephen Fry). Ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door. The door opens and there is Albert Einstein(Walter Matthau) "You're Albert Einstien!" "Zank you" and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring Ed and Catherine together. The subcharacters are great! Especially Einstein's pals played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher. "Three of the greatest minds and together they can't change a light bulb." All in all a great warm funny film! Matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant. He should have been nominated IMHO. You can't go wrong with this one 
I had heard that the movie had some good drills that my daughter might benefit from. The dribbling work the actor does is amazing, but most of these things can be done with practice. My daughter is now proficient at the drills we chose to work on. She made the Varsity as a freshman a few days ago. The story is a good one. It goes into some of the hardships he faced as a kid, but not some of the tougher things he faced as an adult. It is definitely a family movie 
Great story of a relationship between a father and son. This film can be enjoyed by all of the family, even if you are not into basketball. also search on The Basket (2000) and Hoosiers, all great films. 
what many people don't realize is that Pistol Pete became a born again Christain and did not compromise with this movie.He insisted on a G-Rating -no cursing or sexual content that Hollywood would have added,along with a PG-Rating just to sell tickets because they know not many people go to see a G-Rated movie.Pete was a TRUE born again Christain-HE DIDN'T COMPROMISE!As much as he loved basketball,when asked what he would liked to be remembered for he said"My relationship with Jesus Christ." That goes to show you the power of Jesus.He can supernaturally change your life for the better 
This is an excellent gift for your favorite sports fan. I purchased this DVD for my husband. He said it was a very good movie 
A great learning tool for childern of all ages

Pistol Pete is one of my favorite basketball movies of all time, ranking right up there with Hoosiers. I don't understand why they haven't put it on DVD yet. Pistol Pete sticks to the life of 8th grader Pete Maravich. His dad is a coach at the local college and teaches him basketball in his spare time. Pete doesn't fit in very well at school because he is so hooked on basketball. He gets a chance to try out for the team and hijinx ensue. It is actually pretty good basketball to watch - even though it was made a while ago and on a shoestring budget. I wish I could have seen Pete Maravich play when he was alive. Great for the whole family. 
I saw this masterpiece when it first came out, 1971. I have not stoped thinking and talking about it since. The devil you think of are not the devils you will see. It will leave a mark on you. This is not a light film. You won't forget it. Expect a wide range of emotional reponses, widest range of any film I have seen with the possible exception being the Kind Of Hearts with Allan Bates. This film is a realistic rendition of the harsh reality of life for the common people of early France. It is relevant and contemporary in its portrayal of the relationship of church and state then and now. Shocking, disturbing, sadistic, and a brutal harsh reality. If you can stomach history as it was, do yourself a favor and see The Devils, uncut of course. Super acting and great sets. You will think and feel as if you were there 
i just so the uncut version of this movie and if you like perverse and grotesque movies you will enjoy this. an uncut version can be purchased at trashpalace.com check it out 
I was at WONDERCON in San Francisco the other day I went with a purpose,to buy the horror film CURTAINS which is only avail. on VHS.I never found it,but to my surprise I found a masterpiece THE DEVILS on dvd.I snagged it fast and looked on the back,I was so happy to have the DEVILS on dvd,thinking too that it was only a copy from W.B.vhs version,but no!It is a whole new dvd with letterbox format and uncut!That's right I now have the rated x version which I believe has never been seen.Also it has over 70 min.of extra features can you believe it?? It is such a terrific movie very misunderstood,til this day I don't know why it has been lost so to speak.A convent of nuns have lust in their minds for father Gradia(Oliver Reed)he is the most handsome man in there city.The women will do anything for him to have his love.Also the men will do anything to have him dead.With the smoke like dream sequence to the rotted bodies and the ever memerizing directing of Sir Ken Russell this is a movie you must have.Also Vanessa Redgrave gives a performance that the likes of Peter Sellers,Gary Oldman and in a league of his own, the late great Lon Chaney Sr.would smile at. So horror fans stand up and get your wallets out for THE DEVILS is here the version I have is from ANGEL DIGITAL it's the rated X version(never seen before)it has theatrical trailers,hell on earth documentary,interviews with the censors. So buy it now and may GOD pray over your soul 
This Ken Russel masterpiece embodies the reason DVD's were created in the first place. VHS can do absolutely no justice whatsoever to this classic gem! If Warner really does have the rights then they really need to get on it! PLEASE! 
AT LAST!!! ( The Devils )is now available on DVD UNCUT!!!. You can buy it at www.xploitedcinema.com Enjoy!!!! UPDATE IN MY LAST REVIEW I STATED YOU CAN BUY (THE DEVILS) UNCUT AT XPLOITEDCINEMA.COM. SENSE I WROTE THAT I UNDERSTAND THEY MAY NO LONGER SELL IT. HOWEVER YOU CAN BUY IT AT www.dvdhorror.com ENJOY!!!! 
UPDATE: WHV is currently (FINALLY!) preparing a Special Edition DVD of this title, but there is no word yet as to which version - the heavily truncated R-rated US version, the longer, but still incomplete, UK theatrical version, or Russell's recently surfaced (and amazing) full length cut. There is also no information as to whether or not WHV plans to release this in the correct aspect ratio of 2.35:1, or if they are going to crop it to 16x9 and call that "widescreen." I have tried to update this review a number of times and the changes haven't appeared - I don't know why. I am guessing that Amazon takes issue with the contact URL for Warner that I was trying to post here. Go to the message boards for 'The Devils' at imdb.com for that URL. 'The Devils' is an outstanding film that arguably represents the very finest work of both Ken Russell and Oliver Reed. Unfortunately, it is currently in DVD limbo. Warner's VHS is a grainy, heavily cut and very poorly cropped abomination that is at times incomprehensible and gives no indication of the tremendous achievement represented by the film's art direction and cinematography. Recently a COMPLETELY UNCUT print of this masterpiece surfaced in excellent condition. Warner executives attended the screening. So WHY is there no DVD in the works? Here's the story, as best as I was able to find out: First of all, there is no way in hell that an uncut version of 'The Devils' could get an R rating from the MPAA. I have seen some of the "lost" footage, and, believe me; it could never, ever happen - even though this stuff was allowed to air on BBC TV as part of their "Forbidden Weekend" film series. So why not release it NC17? Evidently Warner Home Video will not release anything stronger than an R. (They did not have this policy back when they were selling the "uncut international version" of 'Dressed to Kill' on VHS for years and years - complete with crotch shots, throat slashings and explicit verbal references that had to be trimmed for theatrical release in the US.) It also seems that they won't sublicense their titles - which would allow somebody like Criterion to handle the release. My understanding is that they will only consider an outright sale - which I imagine is prohibitively expensive. The other film that I fear will suffer from these policies is Nicholas Roeg and Donald Cammell's 'Performance' - which I also believe might have been cut for an R, but may have an easier time getting passed if re-submitted. (I do know that it was subject to studio interference.) If you care, Warner Home Video has been moved in the past by consumer outcry - although that was in the case of a cropped versus letterboxed special edition of 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.' 'The Devils,' having virtually no chance of getting into Blockbuster (even in its R rated incarnation), is likely to be a much tougher sell. If you just can't wait until hell freezes over, there is a reasonably priced bootleg DVD available - FAR more complete than this tape, better looking (not pristine by a longshot, but a big improvement), partially letterboxed, with some excellent supplementary materials (BBC's 'Hell on Earth' documentary, containing most of the censored footage). Obviously not the ideal way to see this movie, but it leaves this tape in the dust. (... 
"A mad film is what the world needs," Ken Russell-- That was his opinion of "The Devils" in 1970 when he was interviewed at the Cannne film festival- where his film of the Aldous Huxley novel was thoroughly drubbed by critics. This "is" a mad movie. Russell's visionary cross-breeding of historical realism and unhinged surrealism is un-matched in all cinema. This film is a crazy masterpiece that deserves the ultimate Criterion treatment-- not to be missed by any fan of deeply strange movies 
Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. "The Devils," a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart 
This movie combines two things I love in a film: The actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents. This is an improv lover's dream. AND It makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously, in this case, dog shows. Only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog's rating in context. Mainly though, it is just hilarious. Some (okay-a lot) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately, and nearly too crude for me. Still, it fits the genre. 
Of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, "Best in Show" is definitely the best. The characters and story gel in a perfect comic concoction. "Best in Show" is very different than "Waiting for Guffman" (the first film in the Guest trilogy), although it brings back many of the same actors. While Guffman has a cruel streak in it, "Best in Show" is a little kinder to the characters it skewers -- without losing the laughs. I would skip the third film in the trilogy (A Mighty Wind) unless you are looking for a bittersweet drama. It's just not that funny. If you are Jonesing for a mockumentary fix, search for "G-Sale" -- a quirky comedy very much in the Christopher Guest vein. It got a lot of great reviews and was even labeled "the movie Christopher Guest should have made instead of A Mighty Wind. 
This movie is a scream! I laughed until I thought I was going to die. Comedy doesn't get any better than this. The characters are incredible. It's amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie! Do yourself a favor and watch this movie! It's even better the second time around 
I was not privy to the world of Christopher Guest until a friend of mine told me that if I liked `Drop Dead Gorgeous' then I would flip over any of Guest's films. The video store only had one in, and that was `Best in Show' and I'm SOOOOO glad they had it. This film has to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen, a complete riot from beginning to end. As a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the Mayflower Dog Show. The film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy. There's Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Crenshaw play Leslie and Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (total spoof on the whole Anna Nicole Smith scandal), owners of a prize winning poodle who's won `Best in Show' 2 years straight, and with the help of lesbian handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) hopefully she'll win for a third. Then there's Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist. And there's power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers. There are lovers Stefan Scott (Michael McKean John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu's and each other. But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' Weimaraner who's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex. Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance. The film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken WAY TO SERIOUS, and with Fred Willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish 
This is one of the most underrated comedies of all-time 
I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows. I'm not, so I couldn't tell you. Mediocre at best. "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
"Best in Show" is another of the very funny improvisational dialog movies that Christopher Guest has directed. The situations are scripted by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, but after that they simply let the actors go where they will with the characters and keep the cameras running. In this movie, he takes aim at dog shows, and the results speak for themselves. The plot of this film is very simple, as the audience is following 5 dogs and their owners and trainers as the go to compete in the Mayflower Dog Show. Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins are hilarious as Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan, the gay owners of Miss Agnes (a Shih Tzu), and Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are equally funny as the preppy "win at all cost" owners (Meg and Hamilton Swan) of Beatrice (a Weimaraner). Christopher Guest plays Harlan Pepper, the outdoorsman owner of Hubert (a Bloodhound), Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are the mismatched couple (Cookie and Gerry Fleck) who own Winky (a Norwich Terrier) where Gerry is a geek, and Cookie seems to have ex-lovers all over the country. Last, but not least, we have Jennifer Coolidge who plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot the rich owner of the two-time reigning champion Rhapsody in White (a Poodle), and Jane Lynch who plays Christy Cummings the trainer. The other key members of the cast are Fred Willard, who plays Buck Laughlin the know-nothing TV announcer, and Jim Piddock who is Trevor Beckwith, the knowledgeable color man and who plays the straight man for Willard's antics. There are also some wonderful smaller roles, such as Larry Miler as one of Cookie's ex-lovers and Ed Begley Jr. as the hotel manager. Those are just some of the names, but I can't do justice to their wonderful work in such a short review. The actors are the key to improvisation, and the audience is in good hands with this movie. The situations are funny, but the performances are even funnier. "Best in Show" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8th, 2000. It was not nominated for any Academy Awards, but it did win three American Comedy Awards including: Funniest Motion Picture, Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (Fred Willard), Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Catherine O'Hara), and Christopher Guest was also nominated for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. The film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the American Cinema Editors, Boston Society of Film Critics, British Comedy Awards, Canadian Comedy Awards, the Golden Globes and many more. This DVD includes an audio commentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy which is somewhat low-key, but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention. Also available are quite a few deleted scenes. You will also find the features which are almost standard at this point, such as a trailer and cast/filmmaker profiles. In my opinion, this is the best of the improvisational films after "This is Spinal Tap". 
Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud. Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few. The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event. Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru. Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch). Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills. Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins). Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of. There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount. Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr. Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners. But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, "they all jump." BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. With star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time, this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish 
Certainly one of the funniest films ever. Great acting and directing. Especially suitable for dog owners, but not limited to them. 
This movie is great.Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding JR. work together really well. It has it sad parts and its humories parts. 
HA! Great movie, plot, performances and insights! Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece. My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society. Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much . Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance. It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species. Have some fun and enjoy this movie. It is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels. As a species, we have come so far and grown so little! This movie will make you (oh-oh) think and feel about subliminal and covert topics o human nature that are rarely put well in words or illustrated in today's world. 
How can we ever be disappointed by a Anthony Hopkins performance? In my opinion, one of the best actors of all time ( especially his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter ). In this movie, he plays a anthropologist first living in Africa among the rare and beautiful mountain gorillas. After defending the gorillas and killing 2 poachers in the process, he is captured and sent to a mental institution where a psychologist played by Cuba Gooding Jr.( who gives a good performance) tries to delve in the mind of Hopkins' character and help him. I just love the flashbacks to Africa and the gorillas. Very touching scenes in this movie along with great acting. My favorite part of the movie is the ending where we see Hopkins return to the gorillas and the place he feels he truly belongs and truly wants to be. Great movie! 
Absolutely great! I have it on video and replaced the video with DVD. Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding, Jr. are definately two of my most favorite actors. Dee Moffat Port Angeles, W 
I remembered loving this movie, and coundn't remember why. Tonight, I looked online at Amazon to read what folks had said about it, and found a fascinating difference in the reviews. One the first "page" are 7 reviews. Here are the Titles of the positive reviews (4.9 ave rating): Awe inspiring Good bye -- illusions EXCELLENT MOVIE/Guaranteed to shed a tear!!!, Out of the box A Must See This movie is about control one of the most important movies ever made These words from a negative review: "nature versus civilization is always a rich topic--it's that Instinct boils them down to inane sound bites." Bottom line: You might love this movie or dislike this movie, but there is something interesting to discover in either case. Those who believe in the premise love it, and those who don't believe in the premise do not. I've never seen any movie that can better serve as a basis for significant spiritual conversation as this movie can. 
Definitely a GREAT movie, Instinct, brings to the screen the story of a scientist studying gorillas in Africa who after being "lost" for two years re-appears as a psychopath prisoner charged with multiple assaults and double murder. A young psychiatrist is then given the task of "evaluating" the patient, though what he finds is more than he bargained for... Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face. It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature. The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music, are all WONDERFUL! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)! In conclusion, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over. 
A superb flick. I have recommended it to a number of friends. This is a movie the makes you look at life and ultimately yourself. In my experience, few like what is seen. For those that think outside the box, this is a good thing. You've the oppurtunity to act upon this new insight. In such cases, 'Instinct' becomes more than just another trip through Hollywood; shifting instead into a life altering event. If you have not seen it, then I suggest you do so; BUT(always a but), go in prepared to give some heavy thought to what the movie has to say. This is no 'Matrix' which stuns you with it's special affects. 'Instinct' is a movie of the mind. One can view it as such or (more than likely) be disappointed 
I became interested in this movie after reading the book "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book. It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from "Ishmael" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - "takers" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of "Ishmael". If we don't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature, then nature has had it and so have we 
Everyone should view this film. Judge for yourself. It is filled with an honesty that initially brings forth discomfort. The better part of yourself will have to agree with Hopkin's comments that we humans are "takers." He is quite the teacher in this film. It is a novel, inspiring film. Don't miss your chance to learn from its brilliance 
Everyone thinks this movie is about Anthony Hopkins living out some demented "Gorillas in the Mist" nightmare. That is simply the catalyst for teaching us something about how we relate to the world around us. Everything about this movie is about control, the desire to control those who are not like us, the desire of the guards to control the population, the desire of Gooding's character to contol Hopkins. But, what Hopkins has to teach us is that we are not in control, but we simply hold onto our illusions of control. When our illusions are threatened we become angry and frightened because we are afraid of the reality. Ever wonder why we are so disturbed about a home invasion? Is it because someone came in, or because we had built up an illusion that we were safe, and now that illusion is gone? In this movie look past the gorillas and the corny guards and the predictable plot, look deeper into what the characters reveal about ourselves. Truly, then this is a very frightening movie 
Until Alien v Predator, the best human/alien interaction was Danny Glover's encounter with the alien/hunter in Predator 2. It was a down to Earth (no pun intended) face off between the hunter and the hunted. But humans are predatory by nature... we love the hunt, the kill, the challenge. The aliens never stood a chance. Alien v Predator now introduces the acid bleeding aliens we all got to know and love from that series of movies, faced against these safari specialists with humans thrown in as a bonus. Some one fire up that grill! It's the perfect set up... three races of creatures all pitting their ability to survive against the other. No surpises though... the bad guys lose, the middle guys get a trophy and the humans win... for now. Just don't leave it this way for too long though. We need another episode! 
What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as ï¿½ The Old Curiosity Shop ï¿½. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonn 
I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5. In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films. The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series. It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it. I think they could pull off one more film. Ripley's a great hero. This movie was pretty bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects. I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien. Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money. The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent. Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement. This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
I don't care what people say, I got it right off the bat, what the movie was about I joy it as well .. Alien Predator .. kids,it worked just fine for me .. you got to love .. Predator ..kicking butt .. those cool look Aliens. It's fun watching I'll enjoy, years to come .. Calling Spaceship Earth .. Thank for the trip Thanks for dropping me at back home. Based more on Comic Books "Alien Vs. Predator" .. not so much on passed Alien Movies or Predator Movies. 
Theatrical Version: I thought it was stupid that they didn't stick to the R rated gore that the other Alien and Predator movies have, but thats ok. You get a fair ride that includes many refrences to the movies, but just doesn't deliver the excitment that Alien and Predator gave you. 3/5 Unrated Version: Not as gory as Alien and Predator but a big improvement over the theatrical version. The cuts are gorier, the chestbursters are gorier, and the dead bodies are more disgusting. 5/ 
I am laughing at those 2 star reviews saying how AVP is destroying the Alien and Predator legacy because of its nonexistent plot. All I am going to say is this: go back and watch Alien and P1 again before passing any judgment. I did recently. Both has even less of a story than AVP. Both would be receiving mediocre reviews if released today. Those 2 star reviewers are comparing AVP to how they remember Alien and Predator. Memories are doing a real number on them. The only thing that AVP lacks is originality. However, the story will continue. AVP1 sets the stage for sequels. We should wait and see how it develops. Meanwhile, enjoy the incredible CG and action sequences. In short, AVP is an awesome 90 minute thrill ride, that I am willing to take again and again. And for the record, Paul Anderson is a great director. Check out his "Resident Evil 1." As another side note, James Cameron ranked AVP as the 3rd best among the 5 Alien movies, after "Alien" and his "Aliens" 
I've heard a lot good and a lot bad about this film. I don't think anyone can deny the power in Denzel's brilliant performance, but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned, it's been judged harshly for it. I personally don't know the truth behind this mans conviction, his innocence and his quilt, only he knows, but the portrait painted by this film portrays Rubin `The Hurricane' Carter as a victim of a corrupt system. To me it's a very moving film, regardless if it's true or not, and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom. Denzel delivers his finest performance here; a well deserved Oscar nomination, and proves that he is a very talented actor. I am a fan of Denzel, although I've made my concern very clear (the fact that Denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters), and I feel he shines here. Despite the constant criticism, I feel this is a must-see film, if not for the emotional, albeit somewhat fictionalized (or assumed is a better word since no one really knows), story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved. Dan Hedeya does a great job as the crooked (fictional) detective who makes it his life goal to punish Rubin for a crime he committed as a child (a crime that should never have been considered a crime) and Vicellous Reon Shannon does wonderfully as Lesra, the young man who not only fights for Rubin's freedom but helps Rubin to regain the hope and life he once had. Like I said, very heartwarming and touching, and regardless of whether or not Rubin was guilty or innocent, the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from Lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see 
This film is a true story. It is important for you to know that because some of the facts and reactions seem excessive, and yet... It all starts with a bunch of rowdy black kids who run across an older white man, a local personality who starts playing with these boys of ten or eleven and these boys decide to fight against it, probably without knowing what they were fighting against, except that it was not correct to let an older white man touch you if you were a little black boy. Local police and justice officials will go along a road that leads the same boy who is arrested for ï¿½ molesting ï¿½ the older man to a triple death sentence for a triple murder that he never committed and that will never be investigated properly. The film is absolutely outstanding because it sets the emphasis on this black man, an ex-world champion in boxing, transcending this fate and getting so high in his meditation that he is truly free in prison and truly divine in his mind. This Hurricane thus set as an example and model to anyone whose freedom is endangered, we can move to the 15 year old black boy from Brooklyn who buys and reads Rubin Carter's book in a booksale for 25 cents. His own life is a series of accidental cicumstances that lead him from deprevation among alcoholics to some achievement in a ï¿½ host family ï¿½ in Canada. This black boy, Lesra, identifies with Rubin and gets involved in his case. His Canadian guardians get along with this involvement and they will eventually bring the truth out and convince a federal court that the man is innocent and has to be released from prison immediately. What is important here is how these people react and organize their search and how it succeeds thanks to some nearly immaterial circumstances that go their way and not the simple automatic and habitual way. It is such cases that justify people in thinking there is hope in our societies where the poor cannot have any justice at all because they cannot afford good lawyers from the very start, and later on it is too late : the initial damage can rarely be redeemed, and yet some cases are there to prove it could, even if it does not most of the time. This is one of the films that should be studied in details in all high schools all over the world. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne 
I watched this with total absorption at the plight of this unusual man, the Hurricane. His story, as others outlined in reviews here, is very sad and unjust: accused of a crime he didn't commit by a racist cop with an odd hatred of him, he is thrown in prison at the height of his career. I thought that Denzel Washington was absolutely brilliant, bringing an entire environment and life story with him in each scene as only great actors can do. He is perhaps the greatest actor in America today. This performance is one of his best - you sense his internal struggle to survive, with little of it stated directly. And he grows throughout the film, from a battered youth into a hyper-disciplined athlete, and then as an inmate seeking deeper meaning in life. It is truly amazing how well he pulls this off. Then there is the youth who contacts him, a boy from a similar background who is given a chance by a remarkable and unorthodox household. For some reason, the Hurricane responds to him after ignoring many others, and these two - as well as his foster parents - embark on their own journey of discovery. As the youth matures, he learns about the political system and feels empowered to change things. That is a profoundly healthy of the American political system. Eventually, they do change things, which is also a big step of trust and engagement for the Hurricane. It is really beautiful and uplifting, deeply moving as I identified with both characters. I now want to learn about the protagonists, perhaps in biographies. The story goes to the heart of an America in transition, when I grew up. I do not know enough to answer the critiques about his character by other reviewers. While I think that more details should have been included in the film, the drama is taut and well told in my view. It is a completely successful film experience and I am sure I will introduce this to my children when they are ready to learn about race in America. FOrtunately, the racial tensions are infinitely less acute than when I grew up, so much of this will be historical for them. Warmly recommended 
The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter. The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty. The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them. I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups. The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly? If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid. Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar. Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash. I'm not counting on that, though 
I was very touched by this movie. It was not the actual story/plot, or it's accuracy that was important to me. Rather, what was meaningful about this film was the portrayal of a personal Transcendence the main character brings about in his life--from rage, hate, and bitterness, to self caring, willingness to learning, inner directedness, to a sense of spirituality and something "bigger than himself," to forgiveness and "letting go," and then the untimate Transcendence--reaching out, risking trusting others with his core pain, and risking loving others. Also, this film portrays some very rare people who demonstrate commitment to their principles, determination to care about "the individual" and to rectifying an injustice. I do not know whether or not Rubin Carter murdered those people. From my stand point, this is a movie that models personal healing. It is touching and inspirational--even if it were to turn out to be total fiction 
In the movie DISCLOSURE, with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore (based on the Michael Crichton screenplay), a high-powered, very ambitious and sexually potent woman sexually harasses Michael Douglas in a software company. The resulting chaos this causes in his personal and professional life forces him to accept the irony of his circumstance--him, a man, being harassed by a superior woman--and take her to court, or in this case, arbitration, to save his job. So much controversy was engendered by the plot of this movie and its relationship to the serious issue of sexual harassment (then a fairly new one) that most people ranting on either side about DISCLOSURE's true social significance forgot the actual plot of the movie, and as such, missed its real message: Demi Moore's character was brought to the software company Douglas' character worked for for the sole purpose of getting rid of him in the first place, such that a pretty immoral and essentially illegal business transaction could go through, making the principal stockholders rich. The movie actually begins where the famous sexual harassment subplot ends. Like ERIN BROKOVICH or WALL STREET, DISCLOSURE was not about sex and power, but really a window to the architecture and life-destroying immorality of corporate greed in its entirety. I was slightly put off by some of the publicity surrounding the treatment of the subject matter that is the life of boxer Reuben Carter before this movie came out years ago. But I am still perplexed to the point of amused as to why everyone still rants about every aspect of the film's subject matter but not the actual film itself. Just as people still talk about DISCLOSURE as a sexual harassment irony movie, missing the actual point Michael Crichton was making about the business world, dissenting reviewers have missed the fact that it was a rival movie company's publicity staff who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to see to it that all this historical controversy would make it to the news in time to prevent this movie from winning the many Oscars it probably would have won, without the stink surrounding it. The Oscars have so much money at stake for the studios that could win one for their movie they are almost as political as Washington, D.C. It wasn't the Smithsonian or Cornel West or Mike Wallace or CNN that broke this story, *it was the corporate greed of Hollywood, Inc. itself, doing so as part of a ruthless and pretty immoral business deal against a competing movie studio*. The very debate of Reuben Carter's actual historicity is as much a symbolically absurd morality play on the corporate greed of Hollywood (and the prevailing ignorance of our culture) as the plot of the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit. This whole topic warrants mentioning only because it is, to this day, the secret architect of the opinions Norman Jewison's treatment of Hurricane Carter --above and beyond the overall message and artistic brilliance of the film as a whole--that is reflected in so many people's opinion of the film. History itself, if we're going to be honest, is a form of elitist narcisstic mythology more often than not (see the work of Howard Zinn [A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES], Noam Chomsky [UNDERSTANDING POWER], Edward Said [ORIENTALISM], Edward Hermann [THE TERRORIST INDUSTRY], Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed [WAR ON FREEDOM], Gore Vidal [BURR; LINCOLN; PERPETUAL WAR], et. al). The degree to which ALL history is a lie can be debated until the Exedrin is passed around like cocaine at a suburban garden party; it has little to no bearing on the mythic structure and relevant artistry of great filmmaking--striking at the heart of the actual purpose of history in the first place. Regarding the possible racist unconscious underlying Hurricane Carter's quasi-historical portrayal: by the same token, virtually every movie made in Hollywood before 1978 and God knows how many afterwards, from BIRTH OF A NATION to GONE WITH THE WIND to DRIVING MISS DAISY to FRIDAY AFTER NEXT and beyond, shows the African-American community in such an absurdly one-dimensional and offensively inaccurate light that if we commented only on the historical/social inaccuracies inherent in the depicted subject matter we'd never know what the art form of film actually consists of, let alone what represents it well. MISSISSIPPI BURNING (1988), for example, so enraged Chaney's family members (of the Shwerner, Goodman and Chaney civil rights activists) that they held many a lecture in many a college regarding its blatant historical inaccuracies; historical inaccuracies obviously designed to whitewash history such that the film would be more palatable to the dominant culture of the Reagan Era 80s (as subtle racist apologia usually attracts liberal white audience for civil rights films and did so quite well during his administration). Yet no one, however, not even them, argued that Gene Hackman and Willem Defoe weren't incredible in it, and probably deserved Oscars nominations for their portrayals. What made me see THE HURRICANE is why everyone should see it. Minor flaws notwithstanding (in construction, not research), director Norman Jewison creates a completely magnificent film. And the incomparable Denzel Washington gives what is undoubtedly the greatest performance of his career. From the very first moment the screen is filled with an image of Denzel as the boxer, you have no choice but to believe him and believe in him. Even the downright eerie way Washington completely became Malcolm X in Spike Lee's masterpiece is SURPASSED by the degree to which he took on and magnified the soul of Rueben Carter. I've seen most of Marlon Brando's work; I've seen James Dean's; I've seen the best of de Niro. I have never seen acting like this before, ever. The Oscar given to Denzel for his essentially phoned-in performance in TRAINING DAY a year later was as a "Sorry we screwed you over THE HURRICANE" Oscar. See this film and believe in the nobility of the human spirit again. 
For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man. Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times! In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie. Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame. Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.  
This movie is based on reality in which the boxer Ruben Carter was wrongfully accused of murder. It shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible. Just because Carter was black, he was imprisoned. This film is remarquable and Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic as Ruben Carter. It shows his wrong accusation, the racism, and his descent into madness in prison. It's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending. Ruben Carter is helped by a group of Canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison. It's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone. This movie is up there for me with films like the Shawnshank Redemption and the Green Mile! Highly reccomended 
First of all, I'm reviewing the DVD product and not the movie. This is one of those movies that you either get or you don't. If you've searched for this movie and bought it, chances are you "get it" so I won't write about the movie itself. This is possibly the most disturbing, unique, and fun kids movie ever. I wish there had been some sort of documentary on the DVD. Even if all the original people involved in the production are no longer with us, just some commentary from a film historian would have been interesting. Just what impact did this film have when it was released in 1952? Also, the DVD navigation acted strangely. When I was in the bonus cartoon the "return to menu" function on my DVD player didn't work. I had to hit stop and reboot the DVD to get out of the cartoon and back to the main menu. The "bonus cartoon" however was a wonderful surprise: an original "Gerald McBoing Boing" cartoon (Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony). I'd never seen one of these and I totally loved it. So, I got a great and fascinating movie and a wonderful bonus cartoon, but I was left wanting to learn more, and all I had left to look at were a few black and white still pictures from the production. 
With script and set design by Dr. Suess, this 1952 film is a visual treat. It is both timeless and a 1950's time capsule. The stars are Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy, a popular married duo of the times who have slid into history. The main struggle is between piano teacher Dr. T played by Hans Conried [voice of Disney's TV Magic Mirror and Jay Ward's Snidley Whiplash] and his reluctant student Bart played by Tommy Rettig before he became Lassie's original TV owner. Dr. T wants the bored Bart to practice his piano playing for a recital, but Bart wants to go outside and play baseball. Hayes is a returning veteran working as a plumber who spars/sparks with Healy as Bart's mom, widowed by the Korean Police Action. The bulk of the film is a Suessian dream sequence featuring such set pieces as a dancing hypnosis duel between Hayes and Conreid, a roller skating duel between Hayes and a pair of twins joined at the beard, and the demented dance of the non-piano players. Then there is the giant piano where 500 children [the 5,000 Fingers]play simultaniously There are atomic fears, the powerless place of children, family bonding, Freudian symbolism, meglomania, and musical prejudice. Most of deeper themes will appeal to adults while the younger viewers will enjoy the fantasy [that becomes darker before rising to a happy ending] elements which stand the test of time over 50 years later. I am very pleased that it is finally on DVD 
My children are pretty jaded when it comes to movies. They've been raised on big-budget, high-tech, computer generated films like "Shrek" and "The Incredibles." When I purchased this movie it was for me, as I love old films and this one intrigued me. I put the movie in last night, and my kids and I were immediately drawn into the plot, the characters, the language (It is Dr. Suess.), and the great, imaginative sets. We all loved it. My girls couldn't get enough of the the synchronized skating, Siamese twins connected by a shared beard. I enjoyed studying the sets...as so many reminded me of this great children's illustrater and his legendary work "Cat in the Hat. 
Only Doctor Suess could take something mundane as a child's passing dred of parent enforced music lessons to better artistic appreciation and broaden cultural horizons and make a funny twisted wildly insane movie about it all. Yes the movie is old and dated but the colors are good and the sets are as wildly over the top as anything young Dorthy saw on her field trip to OZ. While their is NO wizard in this picture, the illustratous Dr T is quite the man. Dr. T is a total coo coo composed of part snake oil, salesman, part dictator, part showman, part insane mental patient. While Dr T ain't no wizard he is a sure fire case of chronic weird that must be seen to be fully appreciated. Doctor T is the unchallenged lord of his kingdom a man of absolute power who rules absolutely of course. Dr T has but one goal to hear his master works played by busy busy fingers 5000 of them to be exact each allowing their musical abilities to be made servant to what I can only be describe as a gangantic supendous BORG piano. Dr T has constructed an immense musical instrument and he invites the needed 500 kids to play it. I call his creation a BORG piano because you have no choice resistance is futile once seated at the piano you are expected to play and play and play. Busy Fingers Busy Busy Fingers and one must even darn a special cap that reinforces the busy fingers message. The movie is a bit slow for todays kids but the really young 4, 5 to 6 year old tele-tubby set should roar with laughter watching Doctor T. This is over the top fun for little ones and those older folk still young at heart 
Every time I teach a class on character animation, I refer students to this film - it has incredible character reference throughout, especially Hans Conreid. If you're an animator and you don't already own this, then shame on you! :') Get it now 
As a kid, this movie absolutely weirded me out and I loved it. It's what I'd expect if Charles Dickens fell into a nightmare after viewing a Sali Dali painting of Beaver Cleaver. Campy, creepy, confusing. Kids know better than anyone that the world is a pretty scary place - this movie indulges that shuddery uneasiness in a much healthier way than any current horror flick, and it's stylish to boot. For anyone who finds the color a distraction, I'd recommend turning the saturation down on their set. It's visually rich and carries just as well in black and white. 
No wonder they didn't produce any other live action productions of Dr. Seuss books until after his death. This film gave me a headache. The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly. At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were. I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago. Do check out the "Gerald McBoing-Boing" cartoon thats included on the disc. It contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than "Dr. T" does in ninety minutes 
It amazing to me that for 50 years, this was the Only live-action filming of a Dr Sussus story. I own an old vhs copy of The 5000 Fingers of Dr T. That I found at a resale shop. The movie I have is in blk wht. But I believe that this disc is in color. So I will be getting this one. Theadore Guisel (Dr. Sussus), was one of the more colorful children's authors of the 20th century. To sum him up, He truly was the Salvador Dali of children's literature. He created a surreal world in his stories just for kids. Where everything and everyone was absurd to the enth degree! Only other childrens author that came close to what Dr. Sussus had accomplished, was the late Maurice Sendak. This was my favorite Dr. Sussus story. But a close second is The 500 Hats of Barthlomew Cubbins. Buy this wonderful movie. For both yourself and the kid in your life. Happy, Happy Fingers! 
I first saw this film when I was thirteen - perhaps even younger, as I recall seeing it in black and white. Thirty years on, propelled by memories which still stuck in my mind, I bought this disk from America (it is not released in the UK where I live). Seeing again through adult eyes, one notices the joins - the songs which do not really work, the occasional twee touch. But what a film! Presented in marvellous technicolour, with a cast which takes the script seriously and does not go over the top unnecessarily, thus bringing Dr Seuss's amazing (Freudian?)dream/fantasy to life. This is not an epic. It is an intimate film, which talks to you rather than throwing endless special effects at you to stave off your boredom. (It's also nothing like the recent live action 'The Cat in the Hat'which some consider the worst film ever.) It reminds us of the gulf between adults and children, and Dr Seuss reminds us that sometimes adults have to see through children's eyes to see the truth. But it also lets the adults have their say as well. This is ultimately a film of its time (the early 50s) but it's a film which takes its chances and doesn't play safe. It's a film which is strange, dreamlike - and worth taking to your heart. Thirty years on, I'm glad I did. Why not try it? - you might too 
...when I was a kid. It however did not contribute to my delinquency. Still it left a lasting impression as a towering monument of absurdity 
I LOVe LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE. TOTAL EIGHTIES. Everyone has that one movie that sticks with them well you might be laughing but this is that movie for me, This and Breakfast Club are those movies that I love to watch repeatingly and will continue to do so. The End of Innocence and B.S. and the start of Adulthood 
OH HOW LIFE REALLY EVOLVES WHEN THE REAL WORLD HITS. WHAT BETTER WAY TO PUT THIS INTO ACTIONS WORDS THAN HOW THIS UNFORGETTABLE FILM PERFORMS THE ARTS. BEST ACTING OF THE YOUNG ROB LOWE, DEMI MOORE, THE REST OF THE CAST. A GOOD GUIDE FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS SONS. A MUST KEEP FOREVER! 
A forerunner to Friends and a Brat Pack movie with the most...Brat Packers, St. Elmo's Fire was a romantic comedy that bowed out to theatres in 1985. Seven of the eight stars were in the enviable "Brat Pack" group, young and precocious actors and actresses that were considered the best of the best of their generation. While St. Elmo's Fire is often considered a mellow and almost overblown teen romcom by the starchiest of critics, it's a favorite of many 1980s film lovers. Summary in 13 words: Seven college graduates try and struggle with real life, some succeed, some don't. DVD Details 2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround (English), 2.0 Dolby Surround (Director's Commentary) English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Thai, Korean Subtitles Release Date: 1999 Single-Sided Single-Layered Disc Suggested Retail Price: $14.99 Black Amaray Keepcase Video and Audio The video is remarkably clean. The film was issued in the early years of DVD, when most transfers looked more like cable TV quality, but the video here is exceptional. Presented in its original widescreen is always a good thing, and the print quality is great. The colors are vibrant and accurate, and there's little to no grain or dust. One minor complaint would be the main titles, in its unsettling red font, but other than that, the video is great. Audio is offered in English, but the subtitles are in so many languages that if you wanted, you could learn Chinese by reading the film enough times. It's pretty balanced in terms of dialogue vs. background noise/music. Bonus Features A commentary by Joel Schumacher is one of the many audio tracks given on this disc. He does a pretty good job talking about making the movie, including various tidbits about the actors and the story (which he wrote). The guy's pretty good with a microphone. If only he could have done a commentary for his film The Phantom of the Opera in 2004. A faded and dirt-filled 8-minute EPK about the making of the film is also presented, made at the time the film came out. It has quick interviews with the cast and director, with a narrator talking during much of the behind the scenes footage. Is it an exhaustive documentary? No. Is it a useless 8 minutes of your life taken away? No. It's pretty rewatchable, though a longer more substantial featurette would be welcoming. "Man in Motion" is the music video that uses the St. Elmo's Fire theme with lyrics. It's got a real 80s look to it, and features most of the cast as well as video clips from the film. There are four trailers: St. Elmo's Fire, About Last Night, Groundhog Day, and Jerry Maguire. The trailers for St. Elmo's Fire and About Last Night are not the best video-quality-wise, while Jerry Maguire is not the best movie-quality-wise. Groundhog Day is okay for what it is. There are also cast/director biographies and filmographies up until 2000. Closing Thoughts Perhaps the second best brat pack movie of the 80s (The Breakfast Club, of course, is THE best), St. Elmo's Fire is a wonderful "coming-of-age...now what?" kind of film that is best enjoyed in the company of your closest friends. 
"St. Elmo's Fire" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't. It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep). Maybe this was supposed to be "The Breakfast Club - - After College", but while "The Breakfast Club" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film. The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college. Uh-huh. Yeah, RIGHT. Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that. Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?) Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell. Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her. She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies. Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol. Sounds promising, huh? Well, in what is an early portend of the "Melrose Place" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her. He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home. Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus. Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out. Not exactly "The Breakfast Club". The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves. With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped. Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional. Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that. Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was. And yet, she still gave her virginity to him. Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable. But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent. Lowe really had little to do with his role. Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better. With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him. Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player. Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired. While the title song later become a minor hit, "St. Elmo's Fire" itself missed the mark. 
I begged to see this movie in 1985! I was only 14 but I knew I had to see it and buy the soundtrack. (remember cassettes?) Never has Rob Lowe or Emilio Estevez looked better! Hot, Hot, Hot!! No this isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but if you are a die-hard 80's Brat packer, this is the one! 
Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell. Isn't stalking hilarious? And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen? I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby. I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends". To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok." Wow. Now that's drama. 
Bringing together an all-star 80's cast, this movie seems to be a mesh of all favorites, or perhaps could be described as an older Breakfast Club. Taking place after a group of friends graduate from college, it deals with the concept of an earlier mid-life crisis, that when you are no longer young, and for the first time, truly on your own. It carries the same air as 80's movies, with its poignant and funny moments, and although it speaks to a slightly older crowd, it can be related to almost any audience. 
i placed two orders from this same seller for the same dvd and both came in very quickly in excellent condition there were no problems with making my payment or anything else thank you very much will be looking forward to ordering from you agan. i got two of the same video cuz my daughter wanted her own copy and needed one for the house als

This movie reminds me of back in the dayz, growing up in Kali, I enjoyed because it puts out there the issues chicana girls have growing up, for other people that don't quite get Chicana Life this movie will help you understand, even though now in dayz it's not that harsh, growing up in city like L.A , the barrio is your familia if you want to survive the gang streets.... a must see movie overall!!! Chicana Love, La Travies 
this is a real good movie. better than american me in my opinion. when i first bought it i thought it would be okay but it turned out to be better than i thought. its about 2 best friends who turn on eachother after they both get pregnant by tha same drug dealer. after he dies they later realize always choose ur homegirl before any boy. tha story goes on about other events. tha only thing i didnt like about it was that i thought it ended too early. other than that this is a real good movie.. 
Writen by and starring Harvey Fierstein, this 1988 film was adapted from the stage play. It's set in the New York world of gays in the 1970s, before AIDS. But even then, life was certainly not bliss for Harvey Fierstein. From early childhood Harvey knew he was different. As an adult, he works as a feminine impersonator and has accepted himself, but every day he has to confront his gayness. He uses humor to cover up his hurts and that's why this film can be considered a comedy as well as a drama. But even though I laughed out loud at certain points, it is still a poignant and moving story of an individual's search for love and respect. There are two men in Harvey's life. One is Ed, a bisexual who can't quite come to terms with living as a gay man. He actually gets married and Harvey and the new "love of his life", Alan, played by Mathew Broderick are invited for a visit. Naturally there are complications. But the two men resolve them, move to a new apartment and make plans to adopt a 15-year old gay boy. It's then that tragedy strikes and Alan is viciously murdered. The most important relationship, however, is Harvey's relationship with his mother, played by Ann Brancroft. She's supposed to be Jewish with all the Jewish stereotypical expressions. Sorry, but I didn't get it. She comes across as a caricature rather than a real person. And, had she played the role better, I might even have had a small amount of sympathy for her. This didn't happen. All I did was be amused as she tried to act Jewish. It's a good role. It just needed a better actress. With the exception of Ann Bankcroft's acting, I really liked this film. Harvey Fierstein is outstanding and it clear that the role comes straight from his heart. The rest of the cast did a good job and the cinematography was good. As a side note, part of this movie was filmed across the street from where I live. I even remember when they were filming it. It depicts the neighborhood as a dangerous one. That is not true at all. But, after all, this is the movies. I definitely recommend Torch Song Trilogy and give it a high recommendation. It depicts a time and a place in the world of gay men that has unfortunately ended when AIDS came on the scene. I just wish that the casting would have been better for the mother's role 
Harvey Fierstein's play that won a Tony translates beautifully onto the screen. Even though the movie is only two hours long-- the play was about four-- he captures the essence of this groundbreaking play. Although we previously had had BOYS IN THE BAND, THE STAIRCASE and similar plays/movies about gay people in America, no writer before had said (that I can recall) that gays should adopt children, gays should be monogamous, gays should be honest with themselves, their families and everybody else, gays had nothing to be ashamed of, gays were good people. Fierstein says all that and more in this most seminal work. When the history of the gay movement in the late 20th Century is written, this play/movie will be remembered with the likes of ANGELS IN AMERICA as lasting art. I saw the play on broadway years ago. It was the shortest four hours of my life. Both the play and the movie will make you laugh; they will make you cry. Of course Fierstein, who both wrote the screenplay and plays Arnold Beckoff a/k/a Virginia Ham, gets a tad dramatic at times and his addressing the audience works better on stage than in the film; and maybe the great actress Anne Bancroft overacts as his b----y mother. These are just table crumbs, however, from a magnificent visual feast. All the actors to a person are superb, and the soundtrack is worth owning--Fierstein, who sings his songs live, has a voice no lower than Marlene Dietrich's and just as good. Fierstein also does a commentary on the DVD of this film, offering interesting insights and tidbits about the making of TORCH SONG TRILOGY, a film you will want to see again and again 
This is one of our favorite movies. It makes you cry laugh at the same time. Harvey and the whole cast make you feel as though you are watching real life unfold before your eyes and not watching a movie. This was a must have for our DVD library 
I LOVED HARVEY FROM THE MOMENT I SAW TORCH SONG ON SCREEN. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF HONESTY, SINCEREITY AND COURAGE AND DOWNRIGHT HUMANITY SINCE BEING EXPOSED TO HIS BRILLIANCE. I'M AN UNDYING FAN SINCE. THIS STORY SHOULD BE AN EYE-OPENER TO THOSE WHO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE - HOWEVER SUBTLY - FOR WHATEVER REASON, SEXUALITY, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR EVEN IF ONE IS BLACK, POOR AND FROM NEW ORLEANS AND DON'T HAVE BUS FARE TO ESCAPE HURRICANE KATRINA. DENIAL KILLS. I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD. I AM BUYING MY COPY NOW! 
I recommend this movie as a most usually high star. The Torch Song Trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do (I will leave it to you to identify what that is). The torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen, who is more than what she appears to be on stage. It identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it. This movie is inspirational, comical, sad, and dramatic. There is no other movie of its kind, and no other movie compares. The movie identifies that love can overcome all- and that if there is one thing homosexuals want, it is acceptance, and if you can not do that then get out. This is a must have. The ONLY five star movie I have ever watched 
I found the movie to be wonderful, funny and true to life. The service from Amazon.com to be prompt, efficient, dependable, the delivery was on time and product in excellent condition 
Ok, I'll start off by saying that I'm straight, and have loved this movie since the 80's. It's wonderful! Fierstein is so great and Ann Bancroft is the quintisential Jewish Mother, and, in my opinion, basically steals the movie. Harvey gives a great commentary on this new edition, but if you haven't seen it yet, watch the movie without the commentary first, and then watch it again. You'll laugh; you'll cry; you'll sing along. 
Its 2005 and only recently have I managed to catch the Torch Song Trilogy that was made in 1988. But since 1988, many gay oriented theme movies have popped up ranging from going through AIDs(Philadelphia) plus a more positive approach towards coming of age story (from Edge of Seventeen to Get Real to Beautiful Thing). Not to mention the French coming out with really raunchy coming out gay pieces like Wild Reeds and Come Undone. Thus, when I decided to watch this 1988 movie(due to boredom), I was a bit more reserved and wasn't expecting so much from the outcome due to the fact that there has been many movies since its time. Alas, after watching it for almost 2 hours, I have to admit - IT was GOOD! I could not say that it was good for its time back in 88 since I was eight back then. But now after watching so many gay movies, this is one good piece of writing and film adaptation! Superb I am sure if you wish to know more about the greatness of the movie the other reviewers will have much to say. A must watch 
...thanks to a stellar cast. It`s sad, humourous, cynic... but all in all... It isn`t difficult to fall in love with the main characters or even understand the "villain"(read "mother"). To me it says: "Make your own happiness. U and u alone are responsable for your life. It`s all u got. Now go on and LIVE IT and don`t sulk! 
It's hysterical and pitiful that some of the other 'reviewers' describe this program as though it is some subversive, dangerous, dogmatic propaganda. WARNING: This program teaches children to love themselves and respect others and we all know how threatening and subversive those values are! Quick run back to the cave and hide! The sky is falling!! If you believe little boys playing with dolls is sick and threatens their development, then you won't like this program. If you think it's subservise propaganda to tell little girls it's okay for them to be smart and strong, then you won't like this program either. On the other hand, if you are a nurturing parent and some of your goals include teaching your child to have a sense of self, to respect humanity's differences (gasp!) and to empower (double gasp!) them to reach for the stars, then you'll enjoy sharing this program with your kids 
I love this DVD!! And so does my 3 yr old. I too rented this on a whim and I'm so glad I did. There is no better message to send to your kid than tolerance. Proaganda? Yeah...LOVE was a new voice of the time. This is just a 45 minute movie showing kids that it is OK to be yourself. I have to address Atalanta...finally a princess I can get behind!! My daughter is in full princess mode right now. She saw Cinderella and Barbie movies at our neighbors. Plus they have a closet full of princess dress-up gowns (even a wedding dress for a 2-4 yr old which I find a bit disturbing) But I let her play because she loves it. She dresses up, twirls around and talks about being beautiful. Disney has created this artificial world of beauty and helplessness. They won't be happy until Prince Charming sweeps in and carries them away. What does Atalanta want? To read, travel the world and LEARN. She and 'John from the town' have mutual respect and are friends. The 'Ladies first ' girl in the pink dress was rude. Yes there is a custom of ladies first but she walked to the front of the line when other girls were waiting as well. Seems some folks missed the point on this one. Anything that is commercial free, not telling me what toothpaste to buy or what talking/blinking hammer to buy for my kid is all right for me. And yes I will be taking my daughter to Disneyland. And one more thing...Ms. Thomas is no Aretha but I think she is free to be....Ms. Thomas. Cut her some slack, she was doing something positive, for the world 
I have always loved FREE TO BE YOU AND ME, but now I can also watch the DVD with my daughter. It's so great to be able to share with her the stories and the songs that I grew up with... She loves the babies (Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas) the most 
I just watched this for the first time in 30+ years. I forgot how much squishy liberal dogma was in there, but the songs sure are catchy. Curiously, my kids weren't interested in it at all, but my wife and I wanted to watch. P.S. Listen to Marlo Thomas with your eyes closed. Her singing is terrible 
I bought this because I remembered loving it when I was a kid in the 70s. Now, my daughter is watching it all the time. The basic theme is timeless even if our daughters already know they can be doctors. It's fun and socially educational. 
My two year old just got this DVD as a birthday present. We have watched it three times. Although the animation and styles are a bit dated, and it's kind of odd watching Micheal Jackson, the messages throughout are still timely and I still love it. It was one of my favorites as a child (I remember watching it at school) and I'm so glad I can share it with my daughter now 
My 4 year old daughter likes her DVD. Dad bought it for her because he remembered it from his childhood. He was disapointed that some of the skits he remembered were not included in the DVD but on the whole it rated well with him. It gets watched pretty often in our house 
When my daughter was born, a relative and I wound up reminiscing about this album and how much we both loved it growing up. Next thing I knew, a copy of the DVD arrived as a gift for my daughter and me. The first time I sat down and watched, it brought back all my memories of being a little girl in the 70's. I could even still sing along with the title song! Right now, my daughter is too young to do much except listen as I sing or play music for her, but I hope she grows up enjoying these songs as much as I did. Yes, the visuals are dated, but I believe the messages of these songs are as pertinent now as they were thirty years ago. Best of all, the songs get their messages across without being "preachy." I think this is a fabulous alternative to much of what's out there for kids today, and dated as some elements may be, "Free to Be You and Me" is still a long, long way from going out of style 
Al Pacino is great in these movies and the movies are so masterfully acted out. I believe that Al Pacino is one the best actors alive along with Robert DeNiro and in "Heat" they show that there chemistry on the screen together is untouchable by any other duo. The Devil's Advocate is a great movie because it shows another side to Al Pacino's acting ability 
This film reveals the complex mother-daughter relationships of four Chinese families whose roots from the past intertwine within the present causing conflicts and misunderstandings in their lives. Once the stories from the past are told and understood within the context of ancient Chinese culture and values, the mother-daughter bonds of love become even stronger and indestructable. The stories of the four mothers are told from the cultural viewpoint of the past as flashbacks throughout the film. The viewer learns boys are more revered than girls, a daughter is given in an arranged marriage to a boy from a wealthy family and she is expected to be obedient to her husband and servile to her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law expects a grandchild and blames the daughter-in-law for failing to produce offspring, not recognizing or accepting her son's part in the problem. This particular story was cleverly resolved and had a happy ending due to the creative efforts of the daughter-in-law who used superstition, religion, and cultural values to get out of this unhappy marriage. In another life story, a young attractive daughter is raped by a wealthy businessman, her parents disown her not believing this story. They thought she allowed herself to be seduced due to his wealth. To sustain herself, she became his fourth wife, a concubine but also produced a son, an heir ...whom the first wife took ownership of, as if he were her son. The real mother was not allowed near her own child. Eventually, she proved herself a worthy daughter by a sacrificial ceremony done for her dying mother. Later she reunitd with her first child, a daughter, whom she raised within the businessman's household where the mother enacted an even more heartbreaking sacrifice ... All the stories from the past are connected in some way with the problems the Chinese daughter's are experiencing in their adult lives. Through flashbacks in time, each daughter recalls her own past and how she felt pushed to do things for her mother, trying to please her, yet feeling unworthy. The film blends the stories of all the characters in a very creative and unique manner helping the viewer understand how the context of Chinese culture became the foundation of love on which all their lives are based. June one of the American-raised Chinese daughters begins telling her story and the relationhship and conflicts with her mother who had recently passed away. The roots of the misunderstandings become more clear as the viewer learns about June's mother's life in China ... June learns the expectations her mother had for her, the hopes and dreams for her American daughter were part of an unresolved loss her mother never spoke about to June. June learns about a very painful experience in her mother's life which forced her to make decisions no mother should have to make ... However, due to a letter written by Auntie Lindo to June's relatives in China, June is reunited with her mother's secret past. This is the point where everyone who views the film will need a handkerchief or tissues... Erika Borsos [pepper flowe 
"The Joy Luck Club," in my opinion is about as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen. I would not hesitate to give it ten stars out of a possible ten. The mostly Chinese American cast is absolutely superb in their performances. My favorite character is June, the daughter of Suyuan. At the beginning of the movie, her friends and family have gathered together before she is about to go to China to meet two sisters she did not realize she had until after her mother died. The movie centers around four Chinese women and their daughters. The experiences of the women in China, apparently between the two world wars, were often filled with sorrow and suffering. Their stories are told in Chinese with English subtitles. The experiences of the women in China as young girls and young women strongly influenced how each of them raised their daughters in the United States. I have only a couple quibbles with this otherwise outstanding movie. One is that the women, as young females in China during the 1930's, are occasionally unusually bold in asserting themselves with men who oppress them. While, as a feminist and a very strong believer in completely equal rights based on gender, I generally applaud most of their actions, it does not seem historically realistic given the unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship of Chinese women during that time period. "The Joy Luck" is a great film in all respects, the peformances by the actresses, the general storyline, the cinematography and the music. This is a movie I can watch over and again, enjoying very much on each occasion. The ending to this movie when June meets her two sisters, apparently in Shanghai, is a great scene and very moving, one of the best endings to any movie I have ever seen. 
This movie is a beautiful story about four Chinese women and their four American-born daughters. The stories deal with identity, survival, sacrifice, love, respect, pride, and forgiveness. I cried at the end of this film because this movie stresses the importance of mother and daughter relationship. We carry the spirits of our fore mothers and it dictates what we do with our lives. I have one negative comment to make and it involves the image of Asian men. After drying my tears from watching this movie, something struck me hard because I felt this movie made Asian men look bad. Yes, there were two positive Asian male characters in this movie. There was the stereotypical Asian father who played June's father (one of the daughters). Then there was Lena's second husband, but he came across as a token. It felt like the producers threw him in to keep the Asian community from getting upset, because there was no story development about him and Lena's life and their love, but you knew EXACTLY what happened with Waverly, Rose, and their white husbands. The one character that really bugged me was Rose. Her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an Asian wife. She put her husband's needs before hers and as a result, he wanted to leave her, which she tries to stop. It is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her "worth". After learning her worth, she and her husband stays together. The movie is blaming HER and her culture for why her husband cheated, but blames Asian men when they do the same thing (am I the only one that sees this?). I am a black female (how odd for a black woman to be defending Asian men) and I have studied the Asia culture, so I know this movie is bias. What strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to "The Color Purple". At least the black men (like Mister) are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men (of any race) for their happiness as this movie does. There is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man (I am a traditionalist in that perspective), but Rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy. If you want a more balanced portrayal of Asian women and men, check out the movies from Asia. However, this movie is still a MUST SEE! 
I was told to watch this film after I told someone I loved Memoris of a Geisha and I really liked this one. Told through mostly flashbacks the film tells the story of 4 elederly chinese women as they look back on there lives in China and then when they live in the us, the story then goes on to there children and they show how they live there lives. The film shows how the mothers are all in there children and then show the heartbreak and joyfullness of family. The story is wonderfull and will get you hooked from begging to end. The acting is great from each actress but the flawe is the film is long and I was ready for it to end. But overall it's agreat film to be watch by everyone 
The Joy Luck Club had stayed with me all these years even when I examine my own personal life in the current time. I had read the book when I was in the seventh grade and had a remarkable teacher. She was Mrs. Lattimer (and yes, she was white), a Harvard graduate teaching at an impoverished neighborhood from where I used to grow up. Sometimes, I wondered why she never taught at one of the more prestige middle schools even right now. Still, it was a book that we middle school students had to read and analyze. The class was actually an advance seminar class. Even to this day, I am surprised that we middle school students got a chance to watch a rated "R" movie. It was a "never" to watch a rated "R" movie. The only movies that I can remember watching that were rated "R" were movies in my former AP english literature class-Othello (which actually contained nudity). It's funny because from what I recall, I had couple of friends from the regular classes and they have never seen a rated "R" movie shown in an educational setting. Perhaps being in a gifted class really did come with all the special privileges(even though I was never identified as "gifted"; I was recommended). It just seemed that every book my classmates and I read in AP english could never resist incorporating some kind of sexual element. Indeed, the literary works were very great. And of course, sex is also shown in this movie. Besides the entertainment value of this movie as well as the complex relationships between the mothers and the daughters, it was certainly a movie about survival. Presently, as I sit in my comfortable room, I could only relate to the need to survive and live a fulfilling life, a life that is so wonderful and full of bliss. Life is about survival. The word "survival" will always vibrate and echoe inside my ears and in my mind. It is a word that summarizes the very essence of life. When you're child or an adolescent, it is about surviving through school. Once you graduate from high school, a new level of survival comes into play; and that is to make a living. Let's face it. Life really does center around making a living. We all need and want to live a life free from having to live a low standard of living like poverty and shortages of healthy food and crapy material possessions. Virtually everyone desires to have a career and be financially stable. In times where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, insecure feelings arise and stays in tact somewhere in our minds. The desire to be married to wonderful wife or husband, the desire to feel safe living in a dream home, the desire to not feel frieghtened when you are heavily sick, the desire to give your children and your grandchildren the best possible life, and the list can go on forever...-Indeed, let's face it, MONEY MAY NOT BE EVERYTHING, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE ALL STRIVE TO OBTAIN IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS. Money does have its value contrary to the popular belief that you hear about how money isn't everything or how money can't buy love. Like the feather of the swan-This feather may look like any other feather and seem worthless, but "it comes from a far away distance and contains all of my good intentions. 
This movie has stayed with me since I first saw it almost 8 years ago. I'm very happy to have found it to add to my collection. This movie explores the complex relationship between mother and daughter. And though the story focuses on Chinese mothers and their American daughters, the struggles are timeless and so is the love 
Being first generation in an Asian American family, my sisters and i can really relate to this movie. We watch it about once a year with our mom (who is Chinese) and we always laugh and cry. My favorite part is the scene with Waverly bringing home her boyfriend to meet the family and how the cultures clash. We made our boyfriends (who are all white) watch that scene especially so they know how to act. The part that always brings the most tears is the scene with June and her mom after the crab leg supper. Very typical of Asian American families espcially if you are the first born of immigrants. Recommended for all mothers and daughters to watch 
Flawless and Beautifully Rieveting "The Joy Luck Club" has to be the best movie I have ever seen, and probably will be the only one of it's kind. The story is beautiful and timeless and I encourage everyone to see it. It makes you think of the relationships of your family and how, even though this is a movie, it can impact you beyond belief. It will rock you to the core of your being and I am living proof 
Having Asperger's Syndrome, I was having trouble picturing what is in the book, so when I watched the movie I finally had an idea of what the setting was. What came to a surprise to me was that Rosalind Chao (Keiko O'Brien in Star Trek DS9) was in it. I liked that, but I also liked the emotion behind the mothers when they were young, especially An-Mei. It was saddening when we saw why Suyuan had to leave her two babies behind; I can't tell you why, that would spoil it. I liked this better than the book 
It was great fun to watch this with our sons! This was the pilot episode for the series starring Fess Parker. We would like to purchase all of the episodes for the years the series ran (but have only found this one episode available so far). We would like to see these available on DVD 
simply one of the best tv shows of the 60s down to earth and very entertaining. i have been in search of i think a disney daniel boone when he was not married to rebbeca but was on his way to discover ken-tuck.i seen it on tv in the mid.60s but that was it. so far iam unable to fine.it stared fess parker and ed ames 
One of the best TV Shows of the 60's. I hope more Fess Parker Daniel Boone shows will be available.This was pure entertainment.I have wondered for years why this program was not out on tape. During those years we watched it every week. Those were heroes you could cheer for. I would like to own all the Daniel Boone TV shows.I hope Amazon.com will be able to offer more of these. Harry at Vidayo did a top notch job getting the tape to us 
love this film. as i have reached the ripe old age of thirtysomething (no, don't get me started, I hated that show but cannot resist the anachronism) and am now married with 3 kids, it is just so funny to watch this movie again and relate to/get angry with the characters. been there...done that...and admittedly will probably do it again (and again) 
I WATCHED THIS FILM BACK IN THE 80'S WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED AND I LOVED IT.A REAL TEAR JERKER WITH A TINGE OF HUMOUR THROWN IN.A DEFINATE LADIES FILM I WOULD SAY AS A LOT OF BLOKES DON'T LIKE ALL THAT MUSHY STUFF.GOOD ACTING ALL AROUND FROM KEVIN BACON AND AN APPEARANCE BY A THEN DASHING ALEC BALDWIN LADIE'S FETCH THE HANKIES 
Since I ordered the video on February 13th - I was so impressed by how fast it arrived at my house!! Less than 24 hours later! 
This is just a wonderful, romantic, funny movie, which I finally just watched. This movie seems as timely today as it must have been when it was released in the late 1980s. I've always loved Kevin Bacon and this movie just confirms that he is a multitalented actor. Loved McGovern also as a young and happy wife. Wow, Alec Baldwin was good looking in his younger days! Anyways, this is a great movie. Kick off your shoes, get the popcorn and cozy up! 
*Spoiler Notice* Okay, so maybe the movie was a little quirky, but this was the eighties folks. The thing about this movie on a VERY personal level is that I gave birth to our daughter in 1988 my husband (at the wise old of nineteen, mind you) got to experience the feeling of watching me start to hemorrage (sp?) and be shuffled out of the delivery room with no explanation other than there was a complication. The thing is, while everything around me was in complete crisis, I kept hearing "Woman's Work" didn't have the fear that everyone around me did, I felt calm and reassured. The sound of Kate Bush is always welcome, but at a time like that, it's an absolute gift from the heavens after several blood transfusions, I got to see my little gift from the heavens - who is now 16! So, watch the movie for all of it, but remember that that situation can become very real, very quickly the movie portrayed it beautifully 
I love SHE'S HAVING A BABY Much,,especially That Song THIS WOMAN'S WORK..Kevin Bacon did great in this Movie,I have it ON LASERDISC,And I bought it on DVD too,,A MUST SEE !!! You won't REGRET IT :)) 
This movie is so comforting to me. Its sweet, funny and def. gives you a message. No matter how green the grass may seem (A man that has a lot on his plate: Kevin Bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman) it's not always. moral of the story is you need to go with your heart. He realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his "single self" I absolutely love this movie. love the music, love the actors, love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby. too funny! :) 
Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo. Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters. They are the traditional "Mars" and "Venus" symbols representing masculinity and femininity.  I also understand the last symbol representing "infinity", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of "eternal life" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity.  But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values? (The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity) I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot. Please also forward your thoughts to VBoston at aol.com. 
"She's Having A Baby" is a must for any fan of 80's films. If you *are* in fact having a baby or thinking about trying you will surely be able to find humor in watching this. Some people say this is a "chick-flick", but I think it is for anyone. This John Hughes film is another great one. I am happy to finally have the DVD. The soundtrack is great, too 
Cinderella has always been my favorite "Disney" Princess. A joy to watch for all ages. Glad that Disney put it on DVD! 
I love the movie! I just have one problem. I can't seem to be able to play The Royal Life from Disc 2? I put it in my computer and clicked on The Royal Life and it just gives me a summary of what it's about and then tells me to insert the dvd-rom. Does someone know how to do this 
Cinderella is the film that saved the Walt Disney Company. I don't want to tell the story because everyone knows the story of Cinderella. I highly recommand this movie. It reminds everyone of childhood 
Disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia - lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the US government, and the South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more. By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt said to himself, "What we need is a movie about a girl in trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White." That's what he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella. Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards. The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a Special Edition "extra." In some cases these photos have the animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau. In 1950, Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of Disney's famous "Nine Old Men" - at that time not yet old. Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural. Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs from Disney films before ("Heigh Ho" and "Whistle While You Work" from Snow White, "When You Wish Upon a Star" from Pinnochio, etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. "Oh, we have a hit song, well that's nice." For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1 album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today considered quintessential Disney, most notably "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" from the movie's opening scene, "The Work Song" while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown, and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year) from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene. For their best movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix. Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being "the noisiest movie ever restored" according to its audio crew.) The original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists. A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e. how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover says Cinderella is presented in its "Original Full-Screen Aspect Ratio (1.33:1)". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until 1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is 1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is "formatted to fit your television." I just wish they hadn't lied about it. Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed "Audiences like a happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too long." Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes; the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit. Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully. This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better 
A great story. Never happens in real life though. Great images, everything is very pretty. It's just one of those stories that we remember from our childhood. It's great to watch over and over again. 
"Cinderella" is an animated movie from Disney Studios that will be a family favorite to the end of civilization. The 2-disc special edition DVD actually is an edition worth having. The picture is sharp and clear and the multitude of extras has enough high spots to justify paying a bit more. Walt Disney kept the story basic, which is where the beauty of this movie lies. Cinderella lives with her step-mother, who is subtly wicked, and her two shallow, mean step-sisters. Cinderella has to take care of the house, her step-sisters and her step-mother, while dressing in rags. As we know, the house originally belonged to Cinderella's father. In spite of Cinderella's oppression, she remains upbeat and manages to thrive; somehow keeping the treatment she receives from affecting her. We also know that the king wants his son to marry because he hungers for the pitter-patter of little feet running about the castle. The king conspires to have a ball in which all the eligible maidens of the kingdom are invited. Cinderella sees a chance to have some joy in her life. Cinderella really does not care if she meets the prince; she just wants to do something other than be a handmaiden, housekeeper and cook. Cinderella's step-mother cleverly has her daughters destroy the dress made by Cinderella's animal friends, and Cinderella at last feels the despair that comes to a person held in slavery. When all hope appears lost, Cinderella's fairy godmother appears, and with a bit of bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Cinderella is ready for the ball, glass slippers, carriage and all. The ending of the story is all ready for to give us a good feeling. The magic that Walt Disney gives this film comes from the colorful imagery and the comic relief provided by a host of critters. Cinderella's main allies in this film are mice. The continuing battle between the mice and Lucifer, a cat with a disposition much like that of Cinderella's step-mother and step-sisters, allows behavior that would have been inappropriate for the character of Cinderella. The mice are permitted to voice the anguish that Cinderella usually is unable to. The animation of this 1950 film is outstanding. Remembering that each cell of this movie was hand-drawn and painted makes the achievement nothing less than incredible. The scenes involving the castle and Cinderella's costume are superb examples of hand animation at its best. This movie was nominated for seven significant awards and won four awards. There are surprises in the awards. One nomination was for the 1950 Hugo award for dramatic presentation. The Hugo awards are for science fiction, and the nomination of "Cinderella" appears somewhat a field from the intent of the award. The other surprises are that many of the nominations and awards came years and decades after the original 1950 release, including a 2005 nomination for a satellite award for this 2-disc special edition. In addition to the Disney classic are dozens of features that extend for hours. Some of the features are directly related to "Cinderella." Some, such as those from ESPN, are more of a stretch. Some of the features are interesting and enjoyable; others will be interesting to you depending on your tastes. Once upon a time Walt Disney was the source for classy animated movies. A few of these movies are timeless classics that will intrigue audiences and professionals alike. This movie is one of those. Enjoy!

The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good. In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious. According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that. However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped. Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes. Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera. However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves. The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice. And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful. In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone. So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever. There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous. A basically good premise is ruined. If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth. Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach. I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed 
Great up until the end. Even the end, indeed was very good, huge twist, massive climax; but the writers were blinded by their own prejudices, and wrote it wrong. Basically, the script was fine, except for who had the lines. If you have the last fifteen minutes of the film, with Derrick and Beau reading each other's lines; the film makes moral and physical sense. It sticks to the point, that gossip is dangerous, and also, bad. And also, you'd have an ironic enlightening enlightenment at the end, what with Cathy and Travis being forced to come forward, and fight through an image of hypocracy that would be forced upon them, due to their actions. The writers could then have ended the film with a whole righting of wrongs, especially the wrongs of the past. Seeing as the film was largely about digging up the secret past, to discover the truth that is affecting the present, it would have been fitting that the past could have been laid to rest. As the ending currently stands, Cathy and Travis seem to get off scot free, appearing to be angels, while the Truth of the past is still uncertain, as is that of the present, Derrick takes the fall for the second time, although it's not clear if this is or not, simply his second victimisation, and Beau, and Joshua Jackson go unchecked to the finale, maintaining the victim status that, at the outset of the film, is set up to be questioned, due to the character of their characters. All in all, fantastic characters, fantastic direction, fantastic locations, shots, music, art, fan-bloody-tastic. But the writers ballsed up the script!!! Meh, no matter, whenever I watch the film, I just pretend that all the emotion is the same, but that it's all the other way round. Sort of like watching Cruel Intentions, which is all about INTENTIONS, and feeling cheated when Sebastian gets hit by a car. HIT BY A CAR. WHY OH WHY wasn't he MURDERED? THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE. Murdered by anyone, Kathryn, the black dude, the mother of Cecile. Hit by a car is bloody lame, and pointless, completely devoid of INTENTION of any kind. And that's the way Gossip went. Anyway, for those of you who don't mind having to stop watching cruel intentions just before Sebastian is killed, you won't mind having to imagine the ending to Gossip in a different way. 
I didn't think it would be that great and only saw it for Joshua Jackson, but the plot twists were really good and I enjoyed it a lot. And of course, Kate Hudson, whom I adore, (even though I didn't pay much attention to her in this one). But yeah, I really liked the end. And this is where I first heard of Norman Reedus. Then I saw the Boondock Saints. :-D This is a good movie and is very underappreciated. 
A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.  Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money.  
I love this movie! I watch this in spainsh class, so I only suggest if you can speak a little spanish then you will love it! It starts off slow but it gets better so be patient. Sorry for the spelling. I can't type with the nails on

I LOVED THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND I STILL LOVE IT TODAY! I LOVE THE MUSIC...IT WILL HAVE YOU SINGING THEM TOO! IT'S A FUN MOVIE! A GOOD MOVIE THAT ANYONE CAN WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN! THIS MAKES A GREAT SLUMBER PARTY MOVIE. I THINK IT TEACHES A LESSON TOO THAT WE ALL DEAL WITH....TRYING TO FIT IN, WANTING TO BE LOVED AND ACCEPTED TO LEARNING HOW TO JUST BE YOURSELF. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! IT HAS COMEDY, ROMANCE, DRAMA, MUSIC, DANCING....IT'S A GREAT PICK! 
If you enjoy making fun of movies because they reek of aged cheese, then this is the movie for you. It is so great! 
It is definatly a total 80's movie! Packed full of cheesy music and themes! But I love it! Teen Witch is a feel good movie about being okay with being different! Gotta love that 
I have liked this movie since I was a young teenager...and I still like it. 
Lets start off with how happy I am this finally after all these years got on DVD. I remember watching this movie when i was a kid on HBO. i was not more then 8-9 but I remembered it so vividly that when I decided one day to search on Amazon for it, I went insane when I saw that it was there! This movie revolves around the 80's, you guy can probably tell by the cover picture. Its mainly about a NOT popular girl named Louise Miller who is striving to make it throught school and at the same time crushing over the most popular guy. She went into a fortune telling store and the little lady, Who i have no idea who her name is though, lol she is that lady in poterguist as well. Either way, the fortune teller lady to her that on the night of her 16th birthday, she will have her powers. Louise sorts of thinks the lady was crazy, runs away. True to the Fortune tellers words, she finds out the hard way. She starts to believe in her powers and ability and used it for her own benifits. sooner or later, to make herself to become the schools most popular girl and snag the man of her dreams. but then in that process, she might lose her really close friend that has been with her through thick and thin since the beginning of probably grade school, who knows. LOL. But then later on she realized that her powers she has may be too much for her to handle. will she give it up and go back to who she was, a nobody? or would she learn to use them wisely with the old lady's help and fix the mess that she got herself into? the only tibit of it was when i bought this from amazon. i bought it for the price of $9.99 and then a few days later, the price changed to $6.99. what a way to take the money! 
I thought it was a pretty funny movie. It defintely brought me a flashback from the 80's. I loved it then and I still love it now. Thats why I absolutely had to add it to my 80's collection! 
i was so happy when i watdched this classicc of my childhood and found that it had aged so wonderfully. the scenes where the people rap are so amazing, it reminds me of westside story i think therei s not a better 80s movie,a nd i like the girl in it because she is redheadeda nd not molly ringwald. anywone and everyone should see this movie and stock up on it before it goes out of print! wonderful drama. 
It was a great buy! Got the movie in great time, and there wasn't a thing wrong with it! =) Thanks 
I just love this movie, but it may not be for all, since it is a very specific type of humor. Don't expect "Best in Show" or "Waiting for Gufman," because this is not a mockumentary, but rather a really funny movie about the ups and downs in Hollywood. And may I add, very on point. I just love it more and more...and wish Guest would direct another one this funny. In love with both Emily Longstreth and Teri hatcher. I can't pcik which one, so I'll choose both 
Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) has just graduated from film school. And on top of that, he has won a prestigious film award for best film. Couldn't be better right? Well, not exactly. This new found fame, or glitz, that Nick has discovered is hollow. And so is he for that matter. When agents come knocking and offering him the world, so to speak, he actually believes the hype. But this is Hollywood: a place where dreams can be shattered, and careers ruined as fast as they are created. Ah, how sudden they fall. Moreover, Nick's new-found friends in the movie industry treat him as a pariah. Ah, how quickly they forget. Martin Short plays a great role as Nick's agent, whom Nick believes will be his savior now that his 15 minutes of fame have died away. Also, one of the prime movers of the film industry is aptly played by the late J.T.Walsh [one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood]. As Nick tries to woo back his ex-girlfriend, and the friends whom he has ignored since arriving in Hollywood, he begins to find himself, and learns that it is never too late to learn from your mistakes. Highly Recommended! 
Hollywood make them, then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise. Sometimes they rise again, and sometimes they disappear. And Christopher Guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of Hollywood in "The Big Picture," a quirky, cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of. It has a few awkward stretches, but overall it's a darkly witty cult comedy ("You're tracking failure all over my carpet!"). Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) is the winner at an arty student movie competition, and instantly agents are chasing him all over L.A. In no time, he's the Rising Young Director, with a movie deal at a major movie corporation. But he's also starting to lose sight of his old life, as he tries to become a major success. He changes the style, plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics, turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie. He dumps his pretty girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) for a bimbo actress (Teri Hatcher). When the studio head gets dropped, Nick falls as quickly as he rose. But a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video. This time, can he get it right? Christopher Guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries, tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals. His forthcoming one is another one about showbiz. But his talents are just as present in a "typical" movie, and Guest does a smart, quirky job of it. The lesson: Be true to yourself and your art, don't fall for empty glitz, and don't let success go to your head if you're lucky enough to get it. The story is a pretty straightforward one -- Nick gets great success, it goes to his head, he falls, and he rises again a wiser man. And the movie falls into straightforward lines, without many unpredictable plot twists. At first glance, it doesn't seem that unusual. What makes it special? Well, simply put, Guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit, like the oddballish Pez music video and the noir fantasies of Nick's life. Not to mention the glorious dialogue. When speaking of Nick's one'n'only music video, a studio woman announces, "It's the best one yet, and I've seen 'em ALL!" And Guest manages to show us agents, artists, students, directors and actors, but never descended to cliches. They're real people, no matter how nasty. And Bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is. His best scene is the reunion with his friend Emmet, where he confesses, "I wanna be your friend again." And he's backed by good performances by Longstreth, Michael McKean and a dancing Jennifer Jason Leigh. "Big Picture" treads where many movies have gone before, but it does so with an approach as fresh as a Pez People music video. A must-see 
The story of a young award winner of a filmmaker's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get "his" first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by Christopher(Spinal Tap)Guest. It's a cynical and hysterical look at how Hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis.  Unlike many of favorable reviewers I'm not a fan of Christopher Guest's later works and that's not just because I'm envious of him being married to Jamie Leigh Curtis(lucky dog). I don't find Guffman or Best of Show more than mildly amusing at best. Save for Bob Balaban in Guffman(When Sparky comes back, I almost bust a gut). Sometimes artists do their best work up front. I like Woody Allen's first three pictures the best(What's Up Tiger Lily, Take the Money and Run, Bananas). I think this is the case here. Guest hit gold. Great script, terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast. A near genius(I'm gonna steal one of the other reviewer's word here because it's so perfect, kudos and thanks) "turn" by JT Walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history(alas, another "great" dying so soon before his time like Warren Oates and Robert Shaw). Fabulous work by Martin Short, Teri Hatcher, J,T, Walsh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Fran Drescher, Dan Schneider, Jason Gould, Wakter Olkewicz and seriously I could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines. There are tons of people in this sublime comedy. Its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the Eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene(Bacon/McKean)that comes off as way too cloying. Other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of Hollywood. Someone said comparing this to The Player was like comparing Bagger Vance to Caddyshack. I'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be sub-par. Caddyshack is a classic and so The Big Picture. I am a big, big fan of Altman and The Big Picture is even par with The Player. If either were more biting I would give the nod to The Big Picture. Though, Richard E Grant's performance is almost as good as Walsh's. Nick's(Kevin Bacon)flights of fancy are hysterical. This is an inspired and unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy. 
I don't know why this film didn't win any academy awards for that year. I love movies and this was one of the best I've seen next to "American Beauty" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". I went to art school in California back in the 80's and this film hit the nail on the head. It's so realistic about the movie industry and it's superficial personalities and players. This is how a movie should be made! Definately 5 stars! 
Rashomon (1950; directed by Akira Kurosawa and starring Toshiro Mifune) is one of those films that the truly hip have seen, and not many others; rather like certain books--On the Road, The Satanic Verses, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Naked Lunch--it has a certain hip cache, being one that cineastes have all seen and can discuss in great detail. Name-droppers know they need only mention the name in a knowledgeable context to be viewed with awe. In truth, however, Rashomon is the sort of film that everyone should see; it's a true classic, in a league with Casablanca, Citizen Kane and others. The film examines truth, in the context of a rape and murder in 12th Century Japan, from four different perspectives; a woodcutter who witnessed the whole incident yet was afraid to report it, the bandit who committed the crime, the murdered man's ghost (through a medium) and the rape victim (the murdered man's wife). There are a few elements which remain constant from each version of the story--that the murdered man was tied up and forced to watch the bandit ravish his wife, and that he did indeed die--but how he died varies. It was either a swordfight with the bandit, at his wife's hand with a dagger, or suicide resulting from his being absolutely crushed by his wife choosing to leave with the bandit. Did she demand his death? Did he look at her with scorn after the crime? Was she really raped or did she yield consensually to the bandit? Honesty is also explored in detail, with the wife's honesty being most in question, but also with the three men sheltering from a rainstorm at the ruined gate of Rashomon who relate the story between themselves. This was one of the late Toshiro Mifune's (1920-1997) first collaborations with Akira Kurosawa, and his criminally-insane Tajomaru is masterfully acted. So effective is Mifune's acting that you truly loathe Tajomaru; you're torn between pity and disgust for the wife (Masahiko Kyo, also a brilliant actress), and there are truly few really sympathetic characters among the cast here. The camera work is exemplary, shows what Kurosawa was best known for--unusual perspectives in some truly arresting shots, proving that his eye for detail was as sharp in black and white as it would later be in colour (cf. Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, and Ran, 3 latter-day Kurosawa masterpieces). Absolutely worth seeing, and proof of the saying that there are three sides to every story (to wit: mine, yours, and what really happened)--but also proving that what really happened isn't even ever certain 
This bleak, B film from 1950 was revolutionary in its time, but I have a bit of sympathy for those who might find it stylized and even a little pretentious today. What is truth?--surely a hard theme to tackle. Seems to me that whether the samurai was killed with a dagger or a sword could be easily determined--at least today. There would be fingerprints, etc. On the other hand, consider how much of the story depends on interpretation. Does the samurai really look at his wife with disgust after she is raped? After all, only she would really know--he doesn't say anything. Is she really fierce, as the bandit says, or weeping and weak as she appears in court? Was Kurosawa really poking fun at the genre with the clumsy fighting, or was he depicting stark reality for an audience that still romanticized ancient times? And is the ending really redemptive--I found myself wondering if the woodcutter would go off and sell the child if it was a girl. Even though Kurosawa intended it to be uplifting--note the shining sun--couldn't we wonder otherwise? I found this film extremely interesting as a precursor to the notion that truth is ambiguous--but not non-existent. Did anyone notice that during Machiko Kyo's (the wife) testomony, the score sounded suspiciously like Bolero--but not quite. It was written by a composer named Hayasaka, but I haven't uncovered anything, except that I'm not the first one to think this. 
Although it might seem like an odd starting point, the first time I heard of Kurosawa's Rashomon was when I read Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking for the first time a few years ago. Within this book she alluded to the film because of the various stories detailing the atrocities committed in Nanking differed greatly depending on the source of information. Anyway, a couple of years after that I read Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's short story "Rashomon" and noticed that it really did not fit Chang's brief description of the movie and it was not until I read a later short story in the collection, "In the Grove", did I find the actual short story the film was based on. The film Rashomon was Western film audiences' first real exposure to the films of Kurosawa Akira and it ignited the flame of interest in Kurosawa's films for decades to come. And with good reason, because Rashomon is truly an excellent film and it still tops best films ever made lists constantly. During a terrible rainfall three men, a priest, a woodcutter, and a bandit, duck into the ruins of the Rashomon gate to escape the massive downpour. The priest and the woodcutter have just returned from a court case detailing the murder of a samurai by the bandit Tajomaru. Listening to Tajomaru's testimony it seems like a pretty cut and dry case. He wanted the samurai's wife for his own and after raping her he killed her husband as she asked him to do. However, after listening to the wife's story and even the dead husband's story through a medium, it is hard to say what the truth...is The old saying goes "History is written by the victors" and Rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view the same events, but how lies thread their way into the truth and corrupt it. Kurosawa depicts the scene with the samurai, his wife, and the bandit Tajomaru four times within the film's 88 minutes, and the resulting juxtaposition is quite enjoyable. 
Somewhat curiously, Japanese critics were not enthusiastic about RASHOMON when it was released in 1950 Japan. Today, however, RASHOMON is generally considered to be the film that introduced both master director Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to the west; it is also often cited as the film that prompted The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to create an award for Best Foreign Language film. It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema. Set in 12th Century Japan, the film's premise is at once both very simple and very complex. A man is found dead in a forrest, and several people are brought forward to give testimony in the matter. In some respects their accounts agree--but in numerous others, some obvious and some very subtle, their stories differ. As each character gives his or her version of events, the various differences pile higher and higher, leaving the viewer to wonder at the motivations involved. Has each person simply interpreted the same facts in different ways? Do they deliberately lie in order to protect themselves? Are the differences in their stories deliberate or subconcious? The film offers no easy answers. Some have criticized the film for seeming to state that there is no such thing as ultimate truth, but RASHOMON is more complex than this: it is essentially a meditation on our inability, be it deliberate or unintentional, to reach more than an approximation of ultimate truth due to the very nature of humanity itself. Much has been written about the look of the film, which is indeed memorable. Filmed by Kazuo Miyagawa, it presents the forrest as a living, breathing entity; the images are powerful, the editing remarkable. No less so are the performances, which require the various actors to shift in behavior as each person involved gives their own account of the event; this is particularly true of Toshiro Mifune, a frequent performer in Kurosawa films, and actress Machiko Ky. But whether lead or supporting player, all performaces are equally astonishing. The film has been extremely, extremely influential over the years, and as such it no longer has quite the same "shock of the new" that it had for audiences of the 1950s; nonetheless, this is director Kurosawa working very close to the height of his power, and while he would create other films that equalled and bested RASHOMON, it remains among his masterworks. The Criterion edition is quite fine, offering a near-pristine print with your choice of subtitles or dubbing (the former is recommended) and several memorable extras. Strongly recommended for fans of world cinema. GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
One of the major problems I encounter with people who have viewed this cinematic masterpiece by Kurosawa is that the film is pretentious and boring. And more importantly, that the truth is readily available to the viewer if he or she just watches the film. However, that is the point of the film. What is the truth! We the viewer have the foreknowledge of the crime and the criminal being charged. "Rashomon" has always been one of my favorite films by Akira Kurosawa, although I do not place it in the top five of his greatest. But Kurosawa's fascinating insight into the truth dares us to look at what we hold to as "the truth." Are there any absolute truths? And if so, whose? This film attempts to let the viewer decide who is telling the truth. In Relativism, [a corollary to skepticism] the truth or belief in the truth is relative to the position of the person who is making a statement. Which in turn directly questions the ideal of objectivity: Since this undermines the belief that people can get outside of themselves in order to get at the truth. Therefore, if the truth depends on the observer's viewpoint, how can there be a universal truth--or even an absolute truth? I believe that Kurosawa is attempting to show the audience that although the truth may not be absolute, THERE ARE STILL TRUTHS. Therefore, even though each of the characters Kurosawa has thrown into this film give us a different viewpoint of the truth as they have witnessed it, the individual's themselves give enough of their perception [through their own objectivity], in which the truth can still be found. And Kurosawa does so in a wonderful way by giving four different versions of a murder and rape: One from a witness, and three versions from the people involved in the crime. For me, the film is telling in many ways, some of which I am sure I am wrong about, however, the film is fascinating in the way Kurosawa uses the non-verbal area of the film: The visuals themselves. As in many Kurosawa films, the cinematography does all the talking. Much can be gathered about this film by just looking at the scenery, and trying not to focus too much on the dialogue; as the visuals themselves are as much, if not more, of the story. As for who is telling the truth? And why are there different versions? This I leave for others to decide for themselves. In the film, the attempt to get to the truth is really fascinating. And the telling sign that Kurosawa knew what he was doing is especially evident when looking at the reviewers on amazon disagreeing with each other. Kurosawa did what he set out to do: What is the truth? Toshiro Mifune is the bandit who is charged with the crime, and he does a terrific acting job. The movie also stars the great Takashi Shimura as the woodsman who discovers the scene of the crime. This classic is highly recommended. However, it may not appeal to all viewers. Rent it first. [I own it] But since this film is foreign, and ambiguous in many areas, some viewers may have problems with it. [Stars: 4.5 
Rashomon was a film I seriously never heard about until I took a film class at my College a few years back. Boy was I surprised how well this popular movie was shot, the camera trickery through the woods is spectacular, I love how the sun blazes and blinds the camera in certain shots. There are five different points of view throughtout the film and I think the last take on what really happened to the young married couple is the probably the truth and the best story of Rashomon. Of course this film is foreign so don't forget to set the subtitles on your DVD player. A fabulous and etertaining DVD, don't skip this one. Enjoy 
Rashomon still contains hope that humankind on planet Earth may be a sort of "WORK-IN-PROGRESS". FIRST OFF - This is the film where numerous perspectives/viewpoints of the same event illustrate rather persuasively how [literally] there are often two or more sides to most stories. The central event in this story has been the basis of many similar themes since. The Roshomon knock-off that is the most fun to watch and most illuminating to me is probably an episode of "All IN THE FAMILY" titled, "EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH". Of course, Archie Bunker does not deal in subtlety, so it is an interesting and comical take on the Roshomon theme. Another similar treatment, but this time a drama, is on the big screen and features Paul Newman, "The Outrage", from 1964, with William Shatner, Lawrence Harvey and Claire Bloom as co-stars. This film is hard to find, but well worth the effort. RAMBLING ON ABOUT "RASHOMON": This film is NOT an easy thing to watch. In English it is somewhat less effective and in Japanese one must contend with the subtitles. Still, I suggest the Japanese with subtitles. Be aware, however, that this is a highly visual film so avoid getting bogged down in the subtitles. More than any other film I have seen, "Rashomon" shows rather than tells, so be prepared to pay very close attention to seemingly small details. Like Kubrick, everything you see and the way you see it has been reduced or altered to be just what is needed for the story. In essence, this is a rather stark though epic production and it may take a few viewings to truly appreciate "Rashomon's" true splendor and significance. It is a short movie that I wished was longer though I was quite satisfied with the ending. WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT: [Without giving away the plot of course.] HOPE! Through the re-enactment of some perceptional permutations and nuances of a tragic event we are almost left with the conclusion that human beings are fatally-flawed, evil, weak beings fueled by lust and driven with selfish motives and little else. THE MESSAGE OF HOPE: But then there is a ray of hope in the form of a helpless abandoned infant and what follows. What we see is intrinsically-flawed humans that through self-awareness may seek to improve their character. If this is true, maybe then through self-awareness, human flaws may be intrinsic but solvable over time making us flawed but NOT FATALLY FLAWED! Sentience may over time be our deliverance in the form of character and integrity. If this is true, then humans are not naturally depraved and everything may not be preordained. Perhaps we are a kind of "work-in-progress". What a nice thought, though Kurosawa gives it to us rather like castor oil. ABOUT THE DVD: This is a Criterion Collection DVD and that speaks for itself. Here, however, the best special feature is the rather large booklet that is included with the DVD. The transfer is excellent for a 55-year-old black and white film and it is in Full Screen Format. LAST THOUGHTS: A FILM THAT MAY NEED TO BE SEE MORE THAN ONCE TO FULLY APPRECIATE ALSO RECOMMENDED TO VIEW: --* "EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH", ALL IN THE FAMILY - episode 58, 1973 --* "THE OUTRAGE", Martin Ritt, 1964 
Leave it to the Criterion Collection to give Akira Kurosawa's seminal 1950 masterpiece its due with this superb 2002 DVD package. First, renowned Japanese film scholar Donald Richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other Japanese genres, Yasujiro Ozu's family drama, "Early Summer" (1951), and K� Ichiwara's sun-tribe melodrama, "Crazed Fruit" (1956). Second, there is a seventeen-minute excerpt about the film from a feature-length documentary about its masterful cinematographer, "World of Kazuo Miyagawa", who did similarly amazing work on Kenji Mizoguchi's "Ugetsu" (1953) and Ozu's "Floating Weeds" (1959). Third, if you choose to buy rather than rent the DVD, there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from Kurosawa's autobiography and the two short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa from which Kurosawa and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto based their screenplay. Add a brief testimonial introduction by Robert Altman, and this becomes one of the best of the Criterion Collection DVDs. Set in feudal 12th-century Japan, it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at 88 minutes. Ostensibly a courtroom drama, the multi-layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove. The events of the crimes are told from four different perspectives - a swaggering bandit named Taj�maru, a woodcutter who witnesses the crime, the wife and even the murdered husband by way of a medium. Each account unfolds in a distinct style - an extravagant samurai adventure according to Taj�maru, the wife's melodramatic recollection as a victim, a heroic martyr's tale from the dead husband. In a blessedly economical style, the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds. The framing device is the woodcutter's own flashback of the incident as told to a commoner, but his version is far from the definitive one as he may have stolen a dagger from the crime scene. Kurosawa does such a brilliantly dexterous job in structuring the differing accounts that as the film progresses, it becomes less about seeking the truth and more about the power and inevitable conflicts arising from everyone's sense of ego. The only thing that becomes clear by the end is how individual perceptions shape reality and that the absolute truth is a myth. Miyagawa's expert camerawork is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema, especially the vivid facial close-ups of the main characters, the sharp angles of the sun-dappled forest scenes, and the dramatically ink-tinted raindrops. A sterling cast has been assembled with Kurosawa's muse, Toshiro Mifune, a youthfully feral presence as Taj�maru. Masayuki Mori and an especially vibrant Machiko Ky�, who later reunited in the ghostly "Ugetsu", lend particular distinction to the couple ensnared by the tragic situation, and the three legendary actors show impressive versatility in highlighting different aspects of their personalities in the various accounts. Takashi Shimura, who later starred in Kurosawa's poignant "Ikuru", is also superb as the woodcutter. Many filmmakers have since copied Kurosawa's then-daring narrative structure (for example, Martin Ritt's "The Outrage" and Edward Zwick's "Courage Under Fire"), but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power 
Kurosawa stands out as one of the great directors of modern cinema. This movie in particular is often cited as a shining example of his artistry. The sets, lighting and cinemotagraphy are superb. Where the film falters is in editing. It is choppy in parts to the point of being laughable. Add to that the scenery chewing overacting of Toshir� Mifune and the viewer is left with the sense that Kurosawa missed the mark on this ambitious project. The great director resorts to some rather hamfisted sentimentalities at the end as he attempts to salvage the tale's sound and fury into something of significance. He is only partially successful. "Faith in man" is no faith at all, except (apparently) when compared to what otherwise would be our confidence that mankind is not worthy of our faith 
I loved "Intersection" and I have no idea why it is not more famous. The acting is superb. Richard Gere is especially brilliant as the tormented husband/lover, torn between his family commitments and the ecstasy of his affair. Sharon Stone is a goddess as the cold, regal, brilliant wife and Lolita Davidovich is a delight as the mistress and you know as soon as you see her that she will win the hero's heart. Anyone who has been in a divorce situation will identify with the pain experienced by all. It is truly very sad to see it all through the teenage daughter's eyes, the confusion of seeing both of her parents with new partners. This movie depicts a scenario which is all too common in today's world, a family falling apart 
One reason to watch this film: Lolita Davidovich. If you don't fall in love with her character and become completely mesmerized by her looks . . . you need to check your pulse. Her portrayal as Olivia is right on. Richard Gere and Sharon Stone also put in good performances, but you keep asking yourself as you are watching, "Yo Rich! Are you kiddin'? Choose the redhead!" Completely bashed by critics . . . I think critics can't stand Gere or Stone and Lolita got caught in the crossfire. She's a talented actress and deserved much more ado for her performance 
Intersection started with a disadvantage in that it's a remake of one of my favorite films, Les Choses de la Vie. The original uses a terrible car crash (one of the best ever filmed) as a starting point for a series of flashbacks and reflections on the turning point in an architects life, when the relationship that ended his marriage is in danger of self-destructing because of his inability to make an effort. But where the accident is that film's focal point, replayed in various different ways as a kind of inescapable destiny, in Intersection it is used almost as an afterthought to bring some resolution to a mundane soap opera about an indecisive man torn between his career-conscious wife and his more liberal lover. It's not a case of not giving the film a chance - there have been interesting re-workings of European films by Hollywood before - or expecting a raunchfest because of Gere or Stone's presence. It's just that it's really not very good. The result isn't exactly unwatchable, but it is overwritten, over scored and surprisingly uncinematic. Rydell gives the film plenty of gloss but few cinematic flourishes, concentrating on the seen-it-all-before romance in a way that seems more TV movie of the week than anything worth paying to see on the big screen. Sharon Stone is superb as the ex-wife and Davidovitch does well as the lover despite some unfortunate and unnecessary scenes towards the end that undermine her character to make Gere look good - which brings me to the film's major failing. Gere's character and performance. Gere can act and has done good work, but this is an especially shallow and by-the-numbers ego trip more than a performance. Aside from being the screen's most unconvincing architect (and that includes Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal), the smug, self, narcissistic performance here prevents us from ever caring about whether the character lives or dies. Even the film's one nearly successful scene at a post office when he can't decide whether to post an important letter is ultimately destroyed by his hammy grandstanding phone call at the end of it. Not that the script is any help. Scenes are overwritten, achingly obvious and horribly predictable, with everything spelled out in broad strokes. Ultimately you're just left wandering from predictable scene to predictable scene with little interest. Slick, watchable, forgettable, the final insult is that the novel and Claude Sautet film this misfire is based on is only acknowledged at the very, very end of the credits when no-one is likely to spot it. That said, the filmmakers are probably grateful not to be associated with this one.. 
It has been a long time since American Gigolo, but Richard Gere remains quite a ladies man. Yes, this movie is about complicated relationsships, but the concept has been exceptionally well executed. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest is just gorgeous with dramatic moods and camera perspectives. I thought that while Richard Gere was phenomenal in Primal Fear, Red Corner and in The Jackal, this movie, Intersection, makes him shine and brings out a lot of his superb acting qualities with all kinds of emotions. It is probably because this movie doesn't have the typical blueprint Hollywood ending, that this flick has been overlooked and so far has never received any significant recognition, but the ending is definitely a surprise. There are a number of interesting twists throughout the film and like I said before, the director really captured the various moods and even created and expressed the right kind of emotions. And although the movie has an overall sad undertone to it as it shows the midlife crisis of architect Eastman (R. Gere), it's just one of these rare motion picture masterpieces which you will want to watch at least a few times every year. It's an excellent picture 
It's awsome,nice plot,perfect actors i love richard gere and sharone stone they are really perfect you have to watch this movie if you are a big fan of richard or sharone they are really somethin' they are hot and good lookin' oooooh i love them and i loved the movie it's one of my favorite movies....but the problem is im waitin' for it on a dvd a dvd a dvd a dvd...come on guys im fed up from waitin' plz make this movie on a dvd copy plz plz plz plz plz it's a dream for me and i wish if it will come true cuz im a dvd collector..............Go guys and watch the movie but dont rent it BUY IT and u wont regret.... 
This movie is still as good today as it has always been. I had the original on VHS, but decided to get the DVD because I don't have a video machine any more. The only problem I have is that I was hoping for subtitles because the accent is a bit thick in places and I can't make out what they are saying. I checked the spec and Amazon says the DVD had subtitles. But when I played the movie it said there was were no subtitles. Besides that, no other issues with the DVD. 
Scott Neal and Glen Berry team up in this British film of two gay adolesents coming to terms with their sexuality and the pitfalls it entails. I don't know of a more tender, sweet love story between two young males than "BEAUTIFUL THING". The title says it all. In the face of a cruel world, predjudice society, and family struggles, these two lads find something beautiful and unique, through each other, that they never knew could possibly exist. This is the perfect companion video to "GET REAL". Very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast. If you like gay romance, and coming of age films, this one will surely go down as one your very favorites of all time 
I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship. The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene. Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
I did enjoy this film - it had animated characters - gay sexual tensions - a bit of drama - and a heartwarming ending - 4 stars - You know the story Gay Boy (Jamie) falls for the Hot Boy Next Door (Ste). Is he Gay? Is he Straight? Find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist. Plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath - Jamie makes the first move, a very tense moment in any young mans life! 
Movies, plays, and books are all subjective endeavors. The idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece. In the case of BEAUTIFUL THING, that is not hard to do. From the opening frame you want Jamey to thrive. He hates PE because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer (the English call it football). He jumps the fence and heads home skipping PE for the umpteenth time. Who can blame him and when a school chum's, Ste's, homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn, Jamey's mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship. As the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other, the music of Mama Cass Elliott plays in the background. The story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple. You know they are young but not too young. You wish that had happened to you when you were their age. Earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story, so I won't go into that here. Instead, I want you to see the DVD so you can experience the feeling I felt at the end of the movie when Jamey and Ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors. Unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood, I chose to suspend my disbelief and each time I watch it, I mouth the word "yes". 
I have talked it over with a few of my friends, and I have come to feel that there are certain films that are among the most important in Queer cinema for any generation. For Gen-X, the film I would have to call THE important Queer cinema film would be Beautiful Thing 
A wonderful story about you young men that fall in love, once you see it you want to own it, and i did, so i bought it. ive seen it 4 times and will watch it many times more 
I find this film very interesting, though not for the reasons you would expect. It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film 
This is a charming flick about two teenage boys who discover their love for one another after harrowing circumstances land them in the same apartment and eventually in the same bed 
Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all. Actually, this is a Hollywood "message movie," and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible. There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of "lao wei in China" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character. AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got. As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name "Sam Francisco" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination. I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you.  
How do you separate a socially important film from a great film? Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that doesn't automatically make it a great film. I'm not knocking this film, of course not. But there's a lot of parts in it that I didn't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be, it is or what everyone makes it out to be. Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account. His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he's fired for apparently botching the case. Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that's why he was fired. He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller, a top and famous attorney who is, rather bluntly, very intolerant of gays. So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays. One small nitpick: it seemed like anyone that is in Andy's family or friends circle is against him. There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him. A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking, complete with sad looking wives. It's nothing that derails the film though. And I don't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme's trademark of looking in the camera. It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks...weird, and maybe a bit too on the nose. Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case. Hanks, in a way, reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster. Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar. No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington. Is it a watchable film? Of course, it's quite good and performances are excellent. I don't know whether you should blind buy it though, that's up to you 
Two of my best friends were living their last days when Philadelphia was made. One of them went to the Dr. whose office was used in the opening scenes, and was receiving an experimental drug that was the precursor to today's more successful cocktails. I watched them struggle at a time when Reagan wouldn't even say the word AIDS to the public. Bush wasn't much better. So to have a film come out that tried its best to tackle the most tragic disease in our lifetime, one that touched me personally, well, I was and am willing to forgive a couple of shortcomings. It was a monumental film for anyone struggling with AIDS, and for those who helped support them, giving us all one of the first voices that permeated the psyche of our country, beyond the boundaries of NY and SF. Now I just learned a good 14 years after the fact, that one of those best friends, Tim Pettifer, was among the guys in the waiting room in "One Foot On A Banana Peel and the Other In the Grave" which is included here. In his characteristic modesty, he never mentioned that it might be produced, and it was released after he died. I'm going to buy it of course, and am filled with nervous anticipation (and dread) at the thought of seeing him come back to "life". I've never stopped grieving this loss. My point is that the work and effort that went into this film went far beyond Hollywood and acting and such. It spoke a truth that was, at that time, not being talked about intelligently, if at all. As one of Tim's caregivers, I know for a fact that there was so much in Philadelphia that was spot on. The film bears witness to an excrutiating moment in time, when most of our nation was in total denial. Sadly, not much has changed 
I purchase a lot of DVDs. For the past few years, it seems that almost every DVD comes in a special edition two-disc release that includes deleted scenes, documentaries, cast bios, trailers, teaser trailers, music videos, and the director's recipe for three-alarm chili. I usually don't have time to get beyond the first disc, and much of what I do get around to usually turns out to be as boring as it gets. This time, however, I am happy to report that the two-disc anniversary release of Philadelphia is worth both the money and the time invested in it, even if you already have Philadelphia on DVD. The special features include the 84-minute documentary, One Foot On A Banana Peel and the Other In the Grave, an extraordinary piece of amateur filmmaking by an AIDS patient named Juan Botas. What I did not know was that Mr. Botas' AIDS diagnosis provided the inspiration for director Jonathan Demme to make Philadelphia in the first place, as Mr. Botas was best friends with Mr. Demme's wife. In the meanwhile, Mr. Botas mentioned to filmmaker Demme that it was a shame that the black humor, amazing courage and other interesting dialogue that emanated from his fellow patients at the clinic where he was being treated was being lost forever as it left their lips. Mr. Demme gave Mr. Botas his hand-held camera, and the results so impressed Demme that he wound up releasing the documentary through his own production company. The finished film is touching, oddly comic, tragic and as effecting as any piece of drama you've ever witnessed. One of the patients from the doctor's office was also given a few lines in the main feature, Philadelphia. Which brings us to that film. At the time of its release, Philadelphia received some very harsh criticism from the AIDS community for its perceived flaws; it was judged by many as "too Hollywood" to be realistically representative of the HIV / AIDS experience. To their credit, in the background documentary included here, "People Like Us" (which was the original working title of Philadelphia) the creative team behind Philadelphia (including Jonathan Demme, Tom Hanks and the screenwriter Ron Nyswaner) meet this criticism head on, presenting a defense of their work that is both credible and illuminating. Many complained that Philadelphia was void of any tenderness or physical contact between the male couple (Hanks and Bandaras) but this is not only redressed by a closer look at their scenes together, an extremely intimate scene between the lovers in bed (which was excised from the final cut) was deleted not for its controversy but because the scene simply didn't work (having now seen it, I can attest to this fact). I have long seen this movie as not a film about AIDS per se, but as a film about homophobia. Indeed, the main thrust of the plot (besides the trial) is the transformation of the character of Joe Miller from committed homophobe to a more enlightened and tolerant person. One of my favorite scenes (which it turns out many people wanted to delete from the final cut) deals subtly with Millers transformation - the "opera scene". In that scene, Miller is asked by the character or Andy what he thinks about gay people. The attorney responds that, when straight people think of them at all, most straight people pretty much see all gay people as some sort of sub-human predatory monsters, out to ensnare the children of the world into a twisted sick life, and destroy all that straight people hold dear. Andy abruptly changes the subject, "Do you like opera, Joe?" he asks. Caught by surprise, Joe admits he does not know anything about it - and Andy Beckett - this sub-human destroyer of children, responds by tenderly and passionately explaining his deep love for beautiful music by allowing Joe to see just a small piece of exactly why so many gay men love opera. He plays the aria La Mama Morte, carefully, passionately and articulately explaining the story and the beauty behind the words and music. Joe is immediately transformed - it's clear that he is deeply moved. By playing the piece, La Mama Morte through again in its entirety, the screenwriter and director shows us that the music has stayed with Joe long after he's left Andy's home. We see him leave Andy's apartment and go home in a sort of daze, kiss his sleeping baby and slip into bed with his slumbering wife, while the beauty of the music haunts and caresses him, like a gorgeous gay lullaby. Some of my gay friends were among those who didn't get this scene - they saw it only as a stereotypical depiction of a gay man's love for opera. I got it right away - by exposing Joe to a thing of beauty he'd never experienced before, Andy had suddenly allowed Joe to consider that gay men were not only something more than what he thought, he demonstrated that we are capable of enormous passion and the ability to appreciate delicate beauty. This scene, more than any other, allowed Andrew Beckett to be transformed from a predatory sub-human freak into a human being, not only for Joe Miller, but for many in the straight audience. It has remained one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever, and a small part of what makes Philadelphia such a powerful experience. Highly recommended. 
Like my title says, this DVD is one of the best DVDs ever made. For months I wanted to buy it, but I just couldn't afford it. So I saved up for it and it was worth every penny. This also happens to be one of my all-time favorite movies so when I found out that the anniversary edition was available, I ordered it as soon as I could. This DVD has some really amazing features that I have not seen in any anniversary DVD so far. It has deleted scenes; Bruce Springsteen's Streets of Philadelphia music video; courthouse protest footage and interviews; Joe Miller's Macready Shilts Legal Services TV spot; filmographies and more!! This is one of those DVDs you'll need to buy in order to have an awesome experience of how really great an anniversary edition can be. Though I have to say that I don't know if they are all this good. 
Another movie with sniffling and Kleenex. Tom Hanks, as I foresaw in "Big", is absolutely superb. Another comic, like Robin Williams and Bill Murray, with marvelous depths. And yet the movie is not really about a man with AIDS, as all the critics say it should be, and then berate it because it isn't; it's about society's reaction to gays and AIDS, a much broader subject. On that scale, it delivers well. We don't need detail scenes of Tom Hanks and his lover, or his facing the disease, or any other of the nitty-gritty the critics said was lacking. I think they missed the point entirely. Washington was society, and his slow progression from homophobia to understanding is what Demme is trying to say to the audience. And, increasingly, I am thinking, we should be out there, living life, helping people, instead of watching them on a two-dimensional screen. Maybe movies really distance us from life, instead of imparting more knowledge. 
AIDS is simple word that encloses so many meanings, destinies and opposite points of view. A prestigious lawyer of a very distinguished bureau will be forced to renounce due this disease. This fact will be the point of no return not only for him, but besides a red alarm for all those who think in major or minor level they are far beyond the danger 's line and absolutely immunized against this terrible lash. A bold film, that depicts crudely all the stages of this fatal victim, as well as his professional, social and affective circle, the legal efforts and finally a cry in the darkness of the intransigence and disregard around many human beings. A solid script, carefully built keeping in mind the delicate dealt issues. Tom Hanks dressed his showiest gifts and making the highest performance of his lifetime. He won the Silver Bear in Berlin and the Academy Award for this role.  
Okay, "Philadelphia" what can be said about it ?When i first seen it... I was moved and it made me think-- while watching the opera scene Tom's funeral and seeing him as a child ( not only those both scenes made the movie) but made me think about "god, he looked so innocent happy" and how scary it is to grow up in a world so cold unkind. Also the opera scene gave me goosebumps as Tom hank explain what the arist was talking about...How beautifull and emotional was watching Denzels reaction. Neil young's "philadelphia" is possibly one of the most beautifull song i've ever heard it realy brought me peace. If you decide to rent "philadelphia" ? Think about what i said and also how truly beautifull Antonio Hanks relationship was with so much love and how sad was for Antonio "Miguel" knowing that his bestfriend, lover and companion could die at any moment. ::sigh:: Just watch it 
I stubbornly resisted this movie because its topic about homosexuality, and will admit I was baiased against it for only that reason. When I finally watched it (from a purely paralegal point of view) I was amazed at the sensitivity given the issue at hand: not necessarily homosexuality, but having AIDS, and the bias our society still has for such issues, even in 2005. (And sorry that I allowed my predujiced feelings to get in the way.) It is a case like this - real or imagined - that validates the legal system. A great wrong was comitted against Mr. Beckett, and he fought back, and WON. The relationship between Andy Miguel was handled tastefully and tactfully, and wasn't offensive to me at all. I was especially grateful to see how supportive Andy's family was for him during this horrible time in his life. I very highly recommend this movie for the "historical" value that is has: not only putting a "face" to AIDS and homosexuality, but for bringing awareness to the subject.

Now, along with his buddy, The two will fight, chase, quip, and search to find the truth and clear their names. Final Verdict: Money Talks . . .and they got the walk down just to prove it. Enjoy 
I don't care what anybody else says. This movie is utterly hilarious. Yes, the humor is crude at times and Chris Tucker must say the "f" word 5,000 times. But, his delivery is unbelievable. Perfect timing. Imagine Chris Tucker passing himself off as the son of Vic Damone and Dianne Carroll! He attends a posh Italian American wedding reception and tells everyone he is Vic Damone Jr. There is a scene where Chris calls in a bomb threat at a disco that made me laugh so hard I hurt afterward. Charlie Sheen is a terrific partner in crime. If you liked Rush Hour, you will also like Money Talks. Comedy mixed with some pretty graphic violence. But it works! Take a chance on this one. It's worth it 
This movie is an insult to merely bad comedies. Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let's see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First "screenwriter":" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names" Second "screenwriter" "Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don't have any ideas". Apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of Murphy the Trickster flicks. Basically the plot is Tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name. If that's your idea of humor, I pity you. 
Money Talks is like watching Juice or Friday as in it may not have a chance in hell at winning any awards but it still a fun movie to watch. Chris Tucker is Franklin Hatchett who works at a car wash and scalps tickets to pro basketball games. Charlie Sheen is James Russell a self-centered news reporter who is use whoever to get on top. James does a report at the car wash in which was a plot on set up Franklin and send him to jail for a murder that he did not committ. Franklin gets handcuffed to a drug lord on the bus who is the mastermind behind all the murders that are taking place in the area which we find out is done to find some diamonds. The guy's name is Frenchy and he along with his partners in crime blow up a bus full of people to help get them out of jail and on the pursuit for diamonds. Of course, this incident has Franklin to take the blame. Franklin must now turn to the man that set him up. James decides to clear his name but wants to keep around for sweeps week. The timing couldn't of been worse as he is setting to marry Grace (Heather Locknear) over the weekend. Franklin and James spend a huge chunk of the movie running from cops (of which one is a dirty cop who is in chaos with Frenchy) and Franklin trying to get Frenchy and his sidekicks. Of course, James ended up being at the wrong place at the wrong time as a survilleance camera at a conveinent store catching both he and Franklin on tape as they were running from Frenchy who killed the owner and the camera. James now must also fight to clear his name, try to still get married, and help Franklin bring the villans to justice. Franklin did have some luck as he went to an auction of auto european race cars were up for grabs but one of them contained the diamonds that the villans were looking for. With the help of James soon to be father in law, he got the car and had possession of the diamonds. Just to be sure that the villians could catch Franklin, they kidnapped James and set up an agreement to meet the Colseium which turned into a war zone as Franklin was literally in the fight for his life. A gang, cops, and Frenchy and his group were out to get the diamonds. Thanks to James and some of his buddies, Franklin survived the mayhem. Both he and James got their names cleared, Franklin went back to work at the car wash, James got married and formed a friendship with James. Tucker once again proves that he is one of the most funniest man in showbiz as we watch him quote barry white lyrics and impersonate michael jackson. A must-se 
This movie is so freakin stupid. Yes its funny...but so very dumb. Not good dumb; bad dumb. Terribly, painfully stupid. Funny at times. Best avoided or taken in small doses 
This movie is so funny. The plot can be a little dumb at times but Chris Tucker is what this movie is all about. He is hilarious. One of my favorite parts is when he is on the prison bus imitating Michael Jackson. I have watched that scene hundreds of times and I laugh my [...] off every time 
Besides FRIDAY and RUSH HOUR, this has got to be ONE of Chris' best performances on film or DVD. I bought this movie a long time ago and I'm just getting around to rating it now... THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY and if you haven't seen this movie, I have one question, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? For Eddie Murphy to put out a GOOD movie? Ha, you'll be waiting for tha rest of your life.... GO AND GET THIS MOVIE TODAY 
What do the following have in common? A boy named Ralphie and the phrase 'You'll poke your eye out'! A Red Ryder BB Gun and a sexy, black-mesh, undulating leg that's a lamp. A bar soap wielding mother and a expletive shouting father. A pepto-bismol pink Easter bunny suit and a boy who eats like a piggy.  You're right! They all add up to A Christmas Story! It is about Ralphie, wonderfully played by Peter Billingsley, who longs for a Red Ryder BB Gun! He repeatedly hears 'You'll poke your eye out' every time he mentions the gun. Darrin McGavin is terrific as the contest entering father who is ecstatic when he finally wins. His prize, a leg-shaped animated lamp complete with a black mesh stocking! In his eyes the leg of lamp (I coudn't resist) is absolutely beautiful and, much to the dismay of his wife, he proudly displays it for all to see in their front window. The lamp is a major source of contention between them as each one attempts to move it! His language when anything goes wrong - from the exploding furnace to the sparking wiring to the neighbors free roaming dogs has reprecussions when, in frustration, Ralphie repeats them. Enter Mom with the soap! Don't worry you won't hear the actual words being said but you will get the gist or should that be drift as this is a winter story! Little brother, Randy, is a picky eater and is only successfully coaxed to eat by his mother, played perfectly by Melinda Dillon, when she has him pretend to eat like his favorite storybook animal, a pig! With his face firmly in the plate he eats like one much to the disgust of his father! Although based on the Red Ryder BB gun, there are many other storylines highlighted in this wonderful movie. There are bullies, school friends, Christmas tree lots, Santa coming to town and the hilarious Christmas gift of a pink Easter Bunny outfit poor Ralphie has to try on! You will enjoy this movie! It takes place at a time when I was growing up and many of the scenes recall my childhood. To those of us who grew up in the forties and early fifties it brings back fond memories of our past Christmases. We had real trees adorned with tinsel and glowing with big colorful bulbs, no themed trees with just white lights, our trees glowed with a rainbow of colors. We had favorite radio shows, wore galoshes and had backyards with snow covered sheds just like the ones in Ralphie's backyard. All of those are in this film, and as such, A Christmas Story has a wonderful familiarity about it. You can almost smell the heavy scent of pine mixed with the delicious aroma of a roasting turkey. This movie is a classic and will, once again, be eagerly watched by our family. Ah! Memories are made of this!  
For every season, there is a classic movie. In our house, "A Christmas Story" tops the list when Christmas rolls around. Without a doubt this movie is a classic! Ralphie and his quest for the Red Ryder BB gun -- I do love this movie. 
I love this movie. Every year there is a 24-hour marathon on the television of this film and my family and I watch it at least ten times. It truly never gets old with us as the characters are authentic and full of good humor. It is hysterically funny at times, especially when the father receives the leg lamp in the mail and pronounces the word stamped on the box "fragile" as "fra-gee-lay; huh, must be Italian". Ralphie and his family make my family's holiday a lot brighter and we all look forward to watching this movie every year. 
"You'll shoot your eye out." How many times did Ralphie hear that? Well worth the time to see, any season of the year. Poor Schwartz got blamed for everything! "Ho, ho, ho... 
This movie is downright hilarious the whole way through. In this story, Ralphie, who is 9 years old, must convince his parents and teacher what the perfect gift for christmas is. At first, he hesitates, and when he asks, its always the same answer: "Oh, no. you'll shoot you're eye out!" Raphie stops at nothing to get what he wants. He would not even listen to the teacher when she gave him a C on his "what i want for christmas" paper and told him it's a bad idea. He didnt even listen to who he thought was the real santa. The funniest scenes in this movie are : 1. when ralphie and his friends get chased by 2 bullies 2. when his father gets a lamp shaped like a leg and ralphie's mother "accidentally" breaks it, 3. when the dogs next door take the dinner turkey 4. when raphie find out what the little orphan annie code was only a commercial for ovaltine 5. when ralphie gets soap put in his mouth when he says the F-dash-dash-dash word(it is censored by fudge) 6. when santa pushes him down the slide of doom. My whole family always said, "it isnt Christmas without watching this movie". If you're dying for christmas to come, why not spend time watching this on tv? You'll never miss it, it comes on all day both on christmas and christmas eve 
My whole family loves "A Christmas Story." My sister and I were born and raised in Hammond, Indiana (Shepherd's hometown which he calls "Hohman" in the story), and though it wasn't filmed there, Shepherd captures the essence of the scruffy old steel town. But more than that, it's a great piece of nostalgia. My dad loves it because it reminds him of his own childhood in the 1930's--grumpy father, sooty furnace and all. Everyone will love it because it is a funny take on the American Christmas hullaballoo. Yet under the cynical veneer, there is real magic, and therein lies the genius of Jean Shepherd 
YOU KNOW THE STORY. PROBABLY THE BEST AND MOST TIMELESS CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER. ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE GEMS,(ESPECIALLY DARRIN McGAVIN AS THE "OLD MAN". ONE OF THE CHANNELS WE HAVE SHOWS THIS FOR 24 HOURS STRAIGHT FROM CHRISTMAS EVE THRU CHRISTMAS DAY. TRUE CLASSIC. 
I really can't say anything new that hasn't been said about this great movie, except read Jean Shepherd's novels...you will get a whole new appreciation for the movie and the characters that have become a part of so many of our lives. Thank you Darren McGavin for giving us the best Christmas Present ever 
How many movies can you really enjoy with the young people in your life? This is one of the few. I watched this with great reluctance, and found myself absolutely loving it! Believe me, you really won't be nauseated! You will laugh 
Classic.Epic.Masterpiece.These are the only words needed to describe "A Christmas Story, the greatest Christmas movie of the last 10 million year 
WOW! What a picture. I still enjoy it 20+ years after it was released. This movie was crafted so well that, you still love to watch the Nazi hoard get theirs from... Oh I won't ruin it IF you haven't watched it yet. The special effects inside the ruins is just awesome - I still wonder HOW they did that. This belongs in every action adverture lovers' collection 
This movie is an excellent film! Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, this film is superior to most action films in history. Harrison Ford stars as our hero, Indiana Jones. Along for the adventure is Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and Sullah (Jon Rhys-Davies). Jones must stop his arch enemy frenchmen archeologist Belloq (Paul Freeman) hatable Thoht (Ronald Lacey) and the rest of the Nazis who are after the long lost arch of the convenant, which has powers beyond imagination. Indiana must face snakes, traps, spiders, the Nazis, and the ark itself on an adventure like no other. Some great sequences include finding the golden idol, the bar sequence, the face off with Belloq, the excellent car chase sequence (which in my opinion is the best chase in history), and the legendary opening of the ark, which has ghosts, exploding heads, melting faces, and Nazis who get what they deserve. All in all, I think this movie is a mark in cinematic history 
Amidst all the adventure, I consider this a sentimental favorite because it was one fo the first movies I can remember seeing with my future husband as a young girl. Nothing like a scary adventure movie for holding hands in a movie theatre. And it is a great movie. I think it is the best in the trilogy...but I hear another is coming 
Steven Spielberg directs this action-adventure, which has something in it for everybody. Action, adventure, and even a tiny bit of romance. The plot is simple-Hitler's men have discovered Tanice (not sure how its spelled), "one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark." Indiana Jones, also known to his peers as "Indy", is hired to recover the Ark. The only problem is that Indy has to duke it out with some very nasty Nazis in order to successfully recover the ancient artifact. The Nazis are assisted by a French archaeologist named Beloch (not sure how that's spelled either) who can be considered Indy's archrival. If Jones is to succeed, he must use all his strength and wit to thwart his adversaries, whether they be gun-toting Nazis, sword-wielding Arabs or deadly snakes. Throw in a great (and I mean GREAT) musical score by John Williams, a charismatic hero (Harrison Ford really delivers in the role of Indy) and some pretty darn good special effects, and the result is a movie for the ages! This is one movie I can watch over and over and over and...well, you get the idea. Its non-stop action really packs a punch that is all too often missed in movies today; there is always something interesting going on in this movie. I own this film in the "pan-and-scan" format, which is considered by many to be the "poor" standard of viewing movies. Fortunately, this movie is so good that watching it in ANY format is a real treat! (P.S.-I'd like to know if my reviews are any good to people who read them, and I would appreciate any feedback. 
This is the first in a series of fun to watch action packed movies based on what an archeologist should be. Being a first you will not notice the pattern of the film unless you are used to Saturday matinees. We hit the deck running on this one as we see Indiana Jones making a John Wayne type of entrance. So much that you do not notice the dubious looking character next to him Statipo (Alfred Molina). Until he says "Give me the Idle and I will give you the whip." Now settled down, after his near miss with the natives, Harrison Ford is a professor (Indiana Jones) teaching the fact that archeology is a search for facts not some thrill ride. That very afternoon he is confronted by some government agents. It seems that his old professor Abner Ravenwood has disappeared. They picked up some radio transmissions that contained the name of Abner and a city Tannis. Immediately Indiana Jones knows that the Nazis (natural bad buys) are looking for the Ark of the Covenant (which can be used as a weapon of unspeakable power) and somehow he must bet them to it for the sake of the world. He is helped by an old love interest Marion (Karen Allen) and rivaled by an old nemesis Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Does it really exist? How can he beat them to it? Why is he on the outs with Abner? Hold on for a thrill a minute and don't eat any bad dates. 
The opening scene is an incredible blend of excitement, the unexpected, and even humour. The scene in the Mongolian bar is equally good. And that's the problem. No other scene is quite as good, and at least one just doesn't make sense. Indiana Jones is riding a horse and chasing the Nazi convoy which includes a tank. Why is that convoy running away!?!? They're reasonably intelligent Nazis. Why don't they just sort of, you know, stop? What would Indy do then? No other movie involves the viewer so quickly, but the rest of the movie drops off by comparison. I always watch the first few scenes and skip the rest 
I've watched this film about 4 times. I don't really know what it's about. I should go out, buy a copy, and watch it about 10 more times. The story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic. It ends with a finding of a greater one. In between there's a blur. I think I'm going to buy it. That's all 
It was the summer of 1981 (I wasn't even born yet) and a movie that would give Harrison Ford's career a much-needed bolster with the first chapter in the ultimately successful Indiana Jones trilogy entitled simply "Raiders of The Lost Ark" and this is still light years ahead of it's time especially when placed against countless generic action movies of recent times. Set in the Dust Bowl year of 1936 Indiana Jones is a world archaeologist who is on the quest of recovering an ancient Artifact called the Lost Ark from a remote tribe in Amazonian Brazil but the ark is being persued by rival archaeologists who are trying to gain a hold of it and turn it over the German Nazi-forces who plan on using to completely take over the world and now with the help of a vixen bartender named Marion Ravenwood, Indie and Marion must recover the ARk and prevent the Nazis from gaining power from the Ark. This movie is just utterly amazing and has aged so well even after 23 years since it's release back in 1981. The special effects especially by 1981 standards are amazing and hardly look dated. The acting is awesome especially by Harrison Ford as he shows the emotional vulnerability of Indie and Karen Allen is head on Perfect as Marion Ravenwood. The third part "The Last Crusade" is my favorite of the three Indiana Jones movies but "Raiders Of The Lost Ark" is a very close second favorite tied with 1984's "Temple of Doom". This is a must-have movie but buy it with the Indiana Jones DVD collection! It is amazing! 
Gold Mirror Vision is the lost ark of the covenant Indy. I know your reading this as it is being written by the hand of God. The bible tells of the Ark(Gold Mirror Vision) leveling mountains and laying waste to entire regions. Only 1 person on this earth can hear a signal greater than gold mirror, indy,(harrison) and thats you. Right now hundreds of thousands of Gold Mirror Vision systems for TV and Computers are being released into the world. Only you can save me Harrison. The staff of raw has a red crystal in the center, Red acrylic plastic mirror, that symbolizes the Golden ark of the covenant(Gold Mirror Vision tunnel) 28 gold mylar mirror system built by the hands of God. There's a strong streak of gold good in you Harrison Ford, buy then, nobody's perfect.The Harrison Ford who carries the first Gold Mirror Vision before it, is invincible. Harrison its like nothing you've ever gone after before, nobody knows its secrets, death has always surrounded it, it is not of this Earth. Indy, if the Ark(Gold Mirror Vision tunnel) is in Morro Bay CA. Then it is something that was not meant to be disturbed. It is not of this Earth. Indy we have no time, if you still want the Gold Mirror it has been loaded on a truck for QVC!-PO-KNEE -written for Robert Klick-my protector-aka Oprah Winfrey.GA

Esta es un clasico de mi generaciï¿½n. Muy buena pelicula, excelentes actores y un soundtrack increible. La recomiendo totalmente! 
Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being? And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack). Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms. Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism. Is this film an accurate portrayal of them? Yes, in some ways. Is the film worth watching? Yeah, at least once. Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth. This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film. 
A fun movie all around! Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke are definately the standout stars! Eventhough it's basically a romance movie it still rocks the house! I looooove the gen X 90's feeling it has to it. It really took me back. Lalaine's desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson, too. I also think that she picked the best one in the end. But, the best thing about Reality Bites is it's great filming location. H-TOWN! Makes me sooooo proud to be from here 
I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy 
This film is a "must see" for anyone who has passed through their twenties. You don't have to be a gen x'er to appreciate it. Life should be like this when you are 20 something. Being 20 something in the 70's, I can appreciate the "drugs, sex and rock and roll" feel of the film. Good character development--I especially appreciated Hawke's "slacker" character. Well done. I've known and appreciated many "slackers" that are now successful social advocates. On on 
If this is the generation I am supposed to belong to, I want to disown it. Ben Stiller's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage, and are now trying to find their way in the world. The movies messege is that we are a lost generation, but that is not are parent's fault (where this movie tries to lay the blame). The kids in this movie are just lazy, more or less. And they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives. Indeed, Troy (Ethan Hawke) even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him. Winona Ryder plays waify Lelina, who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends. One day she meets Michael (Ben Stiller) who is their age but has made a good career out of the TV industry. Ethan hates him for his honest approach to life, and so the battle for Lelina's love begins. I really wasn't too impressed with this movie, it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool, tortured artist; when they should get off the couch and go get a job 
I read the very lengthy review that I saw first, and I must say I was appalled. I don't know if your from a different generation, thats fine, but no need to criticize the generations that follow. This has been one of my favorite movies for years. We find Winona Ryder, valevictorian of her university working as an assistant for a cocky talk show host. Finally she retaliates against her position working for the man when she is overqualified for the job. Janeane Garofalo, however, is the hippy of the movie. She enjoys 70's music, and 70's apparel, working at the Gap. Ethan Hawke is a genuis who feels that anything he does is almost a waste of his time until he gets a family wake up call. Steve Zahn is a man who is coming to terms with his sexuality. This is not a movie of losers, this is four people graduating from college, and dealing with the problems in life. Everything is scary once you graduate, and your parents give you the freedom to go without any more assistance. I think this was a great movie with a great soundtrack and an excellent cast getting their start. 
I had the pleasure of being in this movie. I had just graduated highschool. I didn't really know anything. Not about Kent State, not about movie making. My eyes were opened to both. One has to realize, this is a Docu-Drama, not a documentary. Liberties have to be taken to present a story. I wasn't in Kent so I can't say what, if any, liberties were taken. However, I can tell you that looking at photos of Kent State and being on the campus of Gadsden State Junior College, the two campuses were similar. And since the Kent State officials would not let them film there, I think they did an excellent job in recreating that campus. Also remember, no one has ever been convicted or even charged for anything that happened that day. No one really knows what happened. This movie is based on piecing together all of the eyewitness accounts. The scenes in which I took part were during that final bloody confrontation. And I tell you what, the emotions ran high during the filming of those scences. We may not have been in Kent 10 years earlier, but it sure feel like it. It was truly an experience of a lifetime. However, we all walked away alive, unlike those 4 young souls who were cut down seemingly at random. This movie depicts a time in our history that we should never forget....and never let happen again. 
(The following incorporates revisions. Earlier versions earned 5 out of 6 "Helpful votes.") I am a high school history teacher. I occasionally show the last 40 minutes of Kent State to my U.S. History and American Studies classes. That is the part of the film that is most faithful to the historical record as I understand it, and it is one of the most powerful sequences I have ever viewed on network television. My students' responses to the video have often included tears, and always the question WHY? No one goes away unmoved. That said, I think much of the rest of the film is questionable. While portions accurately convey anti-Vietnam street action, the video has a lot of inaccuracies and sometimes betrays its roots as a TV mini-series. For instance, in an attempt to win as wide an audience as possible, Kent State jettisons most of the political background of the antiwar movement and focusses on the generational conflict. (No one watched it anyway; it rated about 70th out of approximately 75 shows during the week it was first shown in February, 1981. No doubt this was because the subject's a downer.) I am nonplussed by the vehemence of the review below. While I did not attend KSU itself, I participated in antiwar protests at the University of Iowa, and the crowd scenes in the video are faithful to what I remember. Given that Kent State was filmed in Alabama, I thought the producers did a creditable job in recreating the look of the KSU campus. (Which I have visited many times.) Kent State books by William Gordon and James Michener both mention stabbings by the National Guard, and Michener's talks about a motor cycle gang. (Of course, the books could be inaccurate, but it's not as if the film's producers made these incidents up out of their heads.) In sum, the closing sequence of Kent State is moving, first-rate television, as well as a powerful teaching tool. Despite the flaws in the rest of the film, the end makes the video more than worth the price of admission 
Yes, I am a video geek...I actually owned this movie on D-VHS and it was the best looking title of ALL my D-VHS movies, even better than Ice Age and Terminator 2 (I still have both of these on D-VHS). The HD-DVD is every bit the equal of its D-VHS predecessor...amazing clarity, wonderful shadow detail and a soundtrack that will bust your windows with the right sub-woofer. This is pure and simple demonstration material 
As an Active Duty Air Force Officer, this has to be by far the best leadership movie ever for newly commissioned Officers and NCO's. 
I just finished watching Das Boot. To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous. Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe. If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick. If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
Excellent movie! Great sound effects! Depth charges shook my room. If you want a good movie to show off your audio gear, this will do it 
Another product of Hollywood's "Karaoke Culture". In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in "U-571" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of "Das Boot". But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it 
Amazon sent me a French version of this movie! You can switch to English but then subtitles appear. Turn off the subtitles but they come on again as soon as the chapter changes. Argghhh! I can't turn off the subtitles at all watching DTS. A total waste of money. I don't think I will buy DVD's from Amazon again 
I thought the acting in this movie was very well done. The people in the movie seemed very real, not the over done, I am in charge, no matter what, if you like it or not, type of acting, usually found in this type of film. Some posters have said that the movie was not true to life. I would guess in a way, it was not, but does it really matter, in a work of fiction. 
Sat down and saw this one on televion. Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money. What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats. The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional. This film Awful. 
I once had this friend in high school, Suzy. She was the quiet little queen bee of ninth grade. Her parents had no idea that she snuck out of their home every night and returned every morning with her tousled, perfect curls still in order, undetected. Eventually her father discovered these midnight trysts and punished her by taking away her makeup for a week. I guess when you are living in a stale household, you are beautiful (and know it), and in need of some stimulation, you can always use your beauty as a weapon - just don't get caught. I loved the Virgin Suicide's character of Lux. Here is a girl, like "Suzy" who is bored with being gorgeous and decided to use it as a weapon to save herself from her 1970's life of "Not my Girls"- style parenting. Lux has beautiful sisters as well, but they don't have developed personalities and are more of a character in whole that sympathize with her. Lux is the queen bee and leader of this family pack of admired beauties. As a young teenager she is discovering the power of her own sexuality. Her curiosities about boys and the outside world away from her parent-controlled, sterile environment lead her to rebellious behavior and experimentation with the opposite sex. Lux is one of Sofia Coppola's more shallow female creatures discovering the thrills of her own charms. She is reminiscent of Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" in her young innocence and ability to indulge in the occasional lack of constant supervision. Lux and her sisters are desperate for some kind of change, a catalyst, someone to rescue them from their lives after losing one sister to suicide. They are in dire need of escape before they lose themselves in an ordinary life. I highly recommend this movie and also suggest: the new "Marie Antoinette" if you are interested in Sofia's continued progress on the exploitation of young , sexually blooming teenage minds allowed to run wild with self-abandon. It's easy to see Sofia's point when watching both films back to back - Dunst, as Lux or Marie Antoinette is still the same teenager-they are still using their young powers of seduction to tantalize and get what they want. One happens to be the queen bee of her high school, the other the queen of France - nonetheless, the same desperate girl in need of affection and attention. 
Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain. The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly. With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the like. Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew. After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence. The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides. Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
Sofia Coppola takes on conformity in a black comedy about a house of five young girls who are just trying to reach out and grow up in the world, if their parents would allow them. It is told through the watching, voyeuristic eyes of young boys who obsess over the girls mentally, emotionally, sexually, and even intellectually. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. There really isn't much I feel there is to say about it, as it is a pretty self-contained little movie. Coppola satirizes the clean warmth of suburbia without the self-indulgence of most artists dealing with conformity. I'm surprised by the cover descriptions and synopses that talk about this film as if it's a mystery; it's about as mysterious as what drives Charles Kane. However the "haunting lyricism" and "dark humor" aspects are pretty correct. It's a pretty good film. --PolarisDi 
Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!? Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false. Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible. But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!? The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night. Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!? It is not matching the character 
This is not just a film about teen angst altho it is that also; extremely so. But it is more so an allegory about how wrong our middle class American culture can go and how, horrifically, the American Dream can turn into a nightmare as much for the people who go on living it as well as for the titular suicides. I think James Woods and Kathleen Turner were excellent casting choices as the parents and both roles that were so out of type and yet fit so perfect that you have to wonder who was inspired to cast them. It hurts so bad to watch this movie but you can't help yourself because even though you're watching for the 5th time it still sucks you in and you really start to root for this family to pull it all together and save themselves. Every time you root with all your heart; every time 
Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material. The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it. One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed. Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator. The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film. I mean this guy did do Godfather, surely he could've given a professional's review of this? It's hard to say which film's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible 
The title of this movie holds no secrets. The Virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom. Almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic, between the acting and a great story line, but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions 
I really have enjoyed watching the movie...three times already and I can say that it "tickles" your mind and think a lot of things at the end of it. Dont judge the book by its cover they say .... and its correct. 
A solid script backed up by a great cast, John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John c. McGinley, Alfred Molina, Amanda Peet and more, are all outstanding. Brilliantly directed by James Mangold who also directed Copland, Girl Intrerupted and Walk The Line, this is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. To say too much about the script would possibly give it away, but in the style of the Agatha Christie's novels 'Ten Little Indians' and 'Murder on the orient express', where people start dying in suspicious circumstances and later they find out they are all connected in some way. In this movie we have ten complete strangers stranded at a desert motel for the night. Sure enough people start getting killed, there is a lot of finger pointing and plenty of twists along the way to keep the audience engaged. The music score is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the whole movie. Special features include bonus trailers, an on the set documentary and 2 very informative and interesting commentaries. One by the director and one by the writer, the latter being the better of the two. The disc features both cinema and DVD versions, although the DVD version only includes 2 extra scenes that last no longer than 30 seconds each. The only fault I have of the movie is that it seems too much time was spent in the first half of the movie bringing the characters together and laying a foundation forcing the ending to seem rushed through to conclude the movie within the 90 minutes, instead of the film being possibly edited longer. All up though, one of the best thrillers you will ever see. I have seen it many times and it is still good even when you know the ending. 
A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear. Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around. It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release! Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing. Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make "Identity" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time. If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever. Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over. Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers 
There have many excellent reviews of this movie, therefore, I would only be going over what so many have already written about this wonderful film. What I will say, however, is that this is an excellent movie. This film is a great study in psychological suspense that keeps the viewer guessing as to who the killer is. Spoiler: When the 10 travelers converging at a motel on a rainy night begin to die one by one, and all in a mysterious, and supernatural type way, you begin to wonder if this is some kind of ghost story. On the contrary, we are all in the mind of a serial killer,[Pruitt Taylor Vince] and his split personalities are beginning to merge. The only way for him to succeed in becoming whole again is to discard the make-believe world that his mind has created. Therefore, we witness the killings that are perplexing, and yet real to the mind of this killer. John Cusack gives a good performance as the limo-driver, as does Ray Liotta as the policeman/escaped convict, and of course the role of the psychiatrist [Alfred Molina] trying to prevent the scheduled execution of the aforementioned serial killer, does an excellent acting performance as well. I highly recommend this movie. It is definetly different than many, if not most of the thrillers on the market today. 
My wife and I saw this movie on its opening weekend and both of us were blown away by the storyline and the acting. We've been Cusak fans for quite awhile (me since "Say Anything") and I have always loved Ray Liotta. The whole movie had this eerie, creepy feeling about it. The story does hold it's own, though it does "borrow" from two masters of mystery; Ms Agatha Christie and Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Once the "twist" comes in, even my wife (who figured out the ending to "American Haunting", "Silent Hill", "The Others") said "OH MY!" and we both bought the movie a couple days after it came out on DVD. The reason for the 4 star rating was that the "Extended Alternative Ending" added about 3 seconds-if that-to the trip in the van. SPOILER: I didn't really understand the basis behind most of the victims relation to each other, mainly the birthdates and the states their last names represented; but after watching it a couple times, it dawned on me. What easier way to make up identities for multiple personalities than to have similar dates of birth or names one can recognize (names of states). I do appreciate Cusak's roles nowadays, but I think he's being too typecast as a romcom star. Come over to Drama, Jon! It's a lot easier to win an Oscar or Golden Globe when you star next to Newman, Hanks, and are directed by Spielberg and Howard 
James Mangold Identity is one hell of a movie. The twist is amazing, didn't see that coming. The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film 
This is one of those 'little' films that sneaks under the radar. I was hooked from the start and amazed at the end. If mysteries and puzzles ala '6th Sense' are your forte, this is the film for you. CAUTION you must think to view this terrific film 
Even though the plot device of characters with split personalities or multiple personalities has been done before, Identity is at least clever with it. This is a really good movie. The movie goes like this: 11 people end up at a motel due to a bad rainstorm and flooding. Once there, the people start getting knocked off one by one. Think of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None meets Psycho. There's the former cop turned limo driver played by John Cusack, driving a self-centered movie star played by Rebecca DeMornay. The former prostitute trying to get to Florida to grow an orange grove played well by Amanda Peet. The young, newly married couple who are far from happy, played by Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott. A convict and the deputy escorting him to another prison. Played by Jake Busey and Ray Liotta respectively. The misogynistic hotel manager who has a couple of secrets.-John Hawkes An older married couple and their young son.-John C. McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Brett Loehr The events happening at the motel are cut in every once in a while by a late-night meeting going on between a psychiatrist and a judge and several other people. The psychiatrist's patient, Pruitt Taylor Vince, looks like Uncle Fester from The Addams Family and is about to be executed shortly after. The shrink is trying to convince the judge that his patient need not be executed. For most of the time watching the film, you don't understand what the people at the motel have to do with this other subplot. Some might be confused as to what the heck is going on, but the tie-in is pretty clever. Some spoilers below. The people at the motel are the 11 different personalities of the Uncle Fester dude that he developed because of years of abuse and neglect. One of these personalities is responsible for a murder rampage the guy went on, which is why he is on death row. The shrink is trying to convince people that he can get one of the personalities to kill the evil personality so Uncle Fester won't do anything else evil. The 11 are there to do battle but don't know it. The doctor eventually taps John Cusack's former cop limo driver, who signifies the strong, good but flawed personality, and tells him what he has to do. Problem is, more than one personality is bad, and it becomes a red herring fest to figure out who is responsible for the murders. It is oodles and noodles better than Twisted and Taking Lives and Hide and Seek and Secret Window and plenty of other thrillers that have come out in the past 5 or so years. But I guess this still isn't saying much is it? Anyway... Very nice way to spend a late night. 
It would never win an Oscar. Who cares?? A fun, spooky movie, kind of campy and fun. A great rainy-night movie, especially since it takes place on a rainy night. This movie was made to entertain, and entertain it does. Loved the twisty little ending. If you like Dennis Lehane novels, you might like this! Kind of a "Shutter Island" feeling to it. 
Just get this concert and listen to it. That's it...nothing more. It's a 'must have. 
This has got to be one of the Best Concerts in history. We had it on VHS, but the DVD is incredible 
I'm not a Pink Floyd fan. I bought this as a gift for someone else. He talked me into watching it and I must say I am impressed. This is as good a concert as I have EVER seen 
Every song on here is incredible!! Comfortably Numb's solo is INSANE, and it has the ball drop down and shining light!!! OMG!!! insane!! get it!!!! 
This DVD is a must have for all Pink Floyd fans and music fans. Not only does this DVD bring back to light the incredible energy and creativeness of the one and only Pink Floyd light show but the sound and reproduction of the music is fantastic. Watching this DVD makes me glad to know I saw Pink Floyd once live but it also will make you yearn for just one more shot at seeing this music live. Who needs Roger Waters anyway 
This DVD set is awesome and well worth the money. It was promptly delivered in a couple of days. I was actually shocked it arrived so quickly! If you are a Pink Floyd fan you will definitely enjoy this concert box set. The lighting designers on this show really know how to use the Vari-lite's to their full potential. Definitely check it out 
OMG - This DVD is fantastic! Disc 1 is not quite as good as disc 2 but that does not detract from how oustanding this set is. Lots of extras - some better than others. The time spent re-mastering everything was time well spent. The effort that went into this tour is mind boggling. A lot of times I just put it on and play it as background music - it even works as a 'Pink Floyd Greatest Hits' soundtrack. Sometimes my tastes do not coincide with those of my friends (e.g. Les Claypool DVD) but everyone I have played this DVD for wants their own copy. If you are a Pink Floyd fan - get it! You will not be disappointed. 
THIS IS THE BEST OF PINK FLOYD, I JUST KEEP WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER. GREAT DVD 
As an intermediate-level bellydance student, I need to continually work in between weekly class to maintain my muscular control, strength, and flexibility. The Lotte Berk method targets the areas needing the most daily work - the hip, upper thigh, deep abs, and arm strength - to execute dance moves with precision and apparent effortlessness. The 30 minute workout time is used very wisely, the pace upbeat and very encouraging, especially when you're going to the limit at the end of a set. Losing focus isn't ever a problem, as the difficult moves are over quickly, and you're immediately soothing and stretching that area afterward. 
This is my favorite video in the Lotte Berk series. Although some of the videos are titled as focused on certain areas (hip hugger abs, for example) all the tapes are actually 30 minute full-body workouts. This is because they all start with leg marching &amp; push-ups, and stretches are interspersed throughout all the exercises. With that in mind, it's a matter of which set of full-body exercises seems the most effective. I believe this one is. I loved each routine, from the modified push-ups, to the intense leg work with the barre, to the unique abdominal toning, and finally the famous knee dancing. The moves are small, subtle, intense &amp; effective. I recommend this tape to anyone who wants a short workout to get into shape 
The thing I remember most about this film when I saw it in the theater in 1990 was its honesty. On every level. Great care was taken to accurately depict one particular community at one particular time--when AIDS was first being diagnosed as "the gay cancer," up through the mid-eighties, when attending monthly funerals was commonplace for gay men and their friends. Though HIV/AIDS had been around for a decade when this movie was made, there was no effort on the part of the filmmakers to whitewash the past. They not only show the ugliness of the disease, they show the ugliness of people's response to it. Even within the gay community there was a tendency for people to fingerpoint, accusing the first victims of being more promiscuous than themselves, or more excessive users of amyl nitrate and recreational drugs. There was fear of contamination, reluctance to touch or kiss, and even intimacy within monogomous relationships was hampered. People reached deperately for New Age cures, and Louise Haye was the reigning goddess of self-healing. By choosing to depict a five-year period, the filmmakers allow the viewer to see the lives of a group of friends evolve and deepen. Some of course succumb to the disease and die, others wrestle with their losses and rethink their lives. In the end, the survivors try to become part of the solution; they become visiting volunteers and political activists. For all its authenticity, the film is not depressing. This is incredible ensemble acting at its best. Campbell Scott, Bruce Davison, and Mark Lamos give especially moving performances, but there are no slackers in this cast. By the time the movie was released, the face of AIDS was already changing and the filmmakers were criticized for focusing exclusively on gay victims. I felt then, and I continue to believe, this is a misplaced criticism. All fiction is self-limited. LONGTIME COMPANION is the story of one small group of friends who are affected by an unknown and dreadful disease; and it shows how each of them responds to the challenges thrown at them. Yes, they were wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together on Fire Island. But LONGTIME COMPANION is not a celebration of their insular lives. In fact, by the end of the film, one of this insular group, Campbell Scott's character, is shown working as a home care volunteer who visits a Latino man. I think the filmmakers, like GMHC at the time, were aware that things were starting to change. It seems to me that the film's critics, even in 1990, had forgotten that AIDS was first announced in the New York Times as "gay cancer" and later as "Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome" before being called AIDS. But that said, we need to remember that there are many other people's stories that are worth telling, including those of people living and coping with AIDS in Africa. My only hope is that these stories will be told with all the accuracy and sensitivity that went into the making of LONGTIME COMPANION. The DVD has no significant "extras," but the transfer is excellent 
This was a wonderful movie about a group of very good friends. The acting is realistic for the movies sake. It will definately pull at your heartstrings. Also full of the comapassion one hopes for in their end days/years. I was a caregiver so this was an important view. Highly recommended!!!! 
This drama is filled with possitive messages but has a darkness to it that will make you angry, in a productive way 
This moview will make you laugh and cry. It show that love and care that a group can give 
This film is a wonder for many reasons: beautiful performances, sharp writing and directing, and SAD. When I first saw this - the sobbing in the theater was so intense that I thought I'd have to build an ark to get home. Now, Longtime Companion is still all of those things but a little dated. Advances in medicine haved moved us to a point where AIDS is not an immediate death sentence. Watching this film years later it does play a bit like "And Then There Were None" - but it still works. Watch it and remember if you lived through that era, watch it and be greatful if you did not 
I saw the scene,where they have Lissa chained to the pool table and gagged in the basement.I didn't understand most of the movie. I bet Kim Possible,Ron Stoppabl,and Rufus can deal with them 
I must say that 'Best Laid Plans' is in a league of it's own. I have never seen a movie that took me for the turns this film did, and anyone who says that they guessed the ending is just lying to make their hatred for this movie resonate. This film may not be perfect, and there are some boring scenes as they try to hard to explain the state Nick is in, but the overall plot of this film is one I've never seen done before. From the opening scene in the bar when Reese enters till you find her chained up in the basement and she tells Nick "we're screwed" you start to realize that what you think you know, you don't...and thats the case throughout this entire movie. From the start to the finish you have no clue who's involved in what. When Nick (Nivola) makes the bad choice of stealing some dope with friends and his friends are caught he ends up at the bad end of the gun. He has just a few days to get $15,000 or he's going to be worse than dead...Then his friend Brice (Brolin) moves back and Nick and Lissa (Witherspoon) come up with a plan, only it backfires, and then they find a way out of it, but that plan backfires and before you know it their back where they started, litterally. THis movie, for all it's twists and turns and ORIGINALITY, while not being perfect still is a recomended film for anyone who wants to see something fresh and different than the normal popcorn munching drama. 4 1/2 stars 
see this it will shock you move you thrill you excite you chill you freak you out it's one amazing, strange movie it really takes a while to understand it at times but it has many valuable lessons one can learn Witherspoons performance is shattering and remarkable among other things. a great movie. will be seen more times then I can count the next times I play it in my playe 
At first glance this would appear to be a VERY serious movie. The opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me of the movie BODY SHOTS, which is a rather disturbing film. What is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon. What you end up with is something totally different than what you think you're getting in the beginning. Reese Witherspoon stars once again as a sort-of young girl lost type persona. She seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in TWILIGHT and FREEWAY. While the present film is not quite as off-the-wall as FREEWAY, it is still pretty far out in left-field. If you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one might be for you. While there are many obvious clues during the film as to what's going on, I did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation. Can you 
This film illistrates the human desire for freedom. A man (Nivola) has fallen in a hole and he needs cash fast. His girfriend (Witherspoon) goes to the extremes to dig him out. This is Witherspoons finest role yet. She takes you deep inside her characters mind and shows how love and compassion direct the character through her toughest decisions. Lissa (witherspoon) and her boyfriend (Nivola) need to get out of this town- find out what they will do to do so 
Great film. Ted Griffin's script is far more powerfull than , say, 'The Usual Suspects'--A fun film with a fun plot twist--but that's a box office handicap. A powerfull story can be powerfully disturbing . . . We can be frightened by the bigger than life bad guy 'Keesyer Sosa' in "Suspects" with complete detatchment. After all, what are the chances this crazed monster is going to blow up your house? It's like watching Dracula. It's fun to be scared precisely because we don't believe in vampires. But in 'The Best Laid Plans ' No boats explode, no running gun battles ensue and we are firmly in America, not Transylvania. Where, to permit myself an understatement, sometimes there's a problem with money . . . So if you were truly desperate, how far would you go to save your skin? Ask the woman you love to have sex with a patsy you can blackmail? Sell out a friend to The Allmighty Dollar? (Wonderfully used by the writer in the metaphor of a rare bill worth a fortune) I mean if your life was on the line with the mob at your heels and the clock was running out, the honorable thing for you to do would be . . ? The hero falls short of heroics here---no wonder they couldn't get a name star to play the male lead--what would his fans think? It's odd how citics are fond of cliche statements about film noir being a genre that 'exposes the dark underside of our culture'--but when a film truly does so with uncompromising brilliance, it's apparently time to back down and go on the scary ride at the amusement park instead. Or make yet another remake of Dracula. Pity. A stylish and suspenseful film. A+ Film Noir 
Having recently seen and thoroughly enjoyed MASTER COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD with Russell Crowe and its incredible depiction of life aboard an early 19th century frigate, I felt compelled to trot out this silent classic from my VHS collection (it's not available on DVD) and revisit this 1926 view of shipboard life. I hadn't seen the film in quite some time and was surprised to note that several scenes in OLD IRONSIDES are quite similar to scenes in MASTER COMMANDER. Surely director Peter Weir must have screened this film before making his. The battle sequences are very similar with sand being spread on deck to absorb blood, the crew hitting the deck to avoid a volley, young boys dying during the fighting, and fierce close up hand to hand combat. Both movies are set during the same time period but the storylines are very different with the USS Constitution (Old Ironsides) versus the Barbary Pirates being the setting here and in the classic Hollywood tradition there is a woman involved. Charles Farrell who was a big romantic lead in the 20's especially when paired with Janet Gaynor, shows here why he was so popular. He is vulnerable but heroic, reserved but not stoic and he possesses an effortless charm that makes him appealing. Although playing the standard damsel in distress role, Esther Ralston makes an engaging heroine who is not a total wimp when the going gets tough. Character actors Wallace Beery and George Bancroft have a field day as feuding sailors while George Godfrey is featured in a more significant role than black actors of the time were usually given. Add to that some brief nudity and a discreetly sexy performance from Ralston (she was once known as The American Venus) and you have a real winner on your hands. The film is well directed by James Cruze (THE COVERED WAGON, THE GREAT GABBO) who is all but forgotten today due to most of his films being lost. Hopefully Paramount will soon release this on DVD along with the others in their silent film series of a few years ago including WINGS. Until then this VHS version which features a beautiful print and a digitally recorded organ score by Gaylord Carter at an excellent price is certainly worth having 
This classic from the silent movie era is great fun and an historically accurate romance/adventure about the battles against the Barbary pirates. There is plenty of action in what must have been one of the first films to depict a sea battle. And yet the scenes are very realistic in what it probably was like. The only literary license they took was when the cannonball bounced off the side which resulted in the USS CONSTITUTION being dubbed "Old Ironsides". That actually happened in a later war 
Ever think your computer has a mind of its own. Well when a super computer that is built to control the nuclear weapons that defend our country becomes self aware, it decides to take control of the planet along with another super computer that was built in the U.S.S.R. When the humans try to turn it off they are in for something they never even dreamed would happen.Buy this movie and see what our future may hold with how advanced our computers are becoming every da 
A supercomputer that takes over the world, eh? Sounds like a rather unbelievable plot, except that in this movie they make it believable. That is, if you can believe they'd make the computer in the first place that controls all the nuclear bombs in the U.S., which I had a very hard time believing as most people who make war machines would install some kind of manual safety. This movie starts out optimistic which makes it a bit dull at the start, but about halfway through it becomes very intense. The ending is very chilling, and makes me wish there was another couple hours. I give it 4 stars because it is a bit slow and predictable at the start, but it builds and builds until the end scares the pants right of you 
I would recommend anyone getting into the Terminator series should see this movie first. Colossus - The Forbin Project demonstrates how computers and machines take over the world and for humanities first struggle to become free. Very good plot and detail 
This is a fine movie and enjoyable inspite of it being in the "TV" fomat I wish it was released in it's origonal format but it's still a fine addition to any sci-fi buffs collection 
that is my biggest gripe about this movie ,its not wide screen ,but must be a copy somewhere ,opening credits show it,all that aside still a tight and tense drama and some black humour in there too,even computors can have a sense of humour t 
What a great movie. And it's still believable after all these years even with the mainframe computer consoles and tape reels and camera monitors. The panscan is very well executed and hardly noticeable or annoying. The print that was used has stood up very well. This is the movie that got me interested in programming computers when I first saw it. Before there even was a Microsoft, I had dreams of one day building my very own super computer under a mountain somewhere. The damn things can now fall deep inside your ear canal and lodge inside your brain if you're not careful. I wish the movie had more story to it instead of just being a rather quick build-up to an even quicker ending. But this is a movie I can watch over again and again. Wow. This isn't just any movie about a mainframe and its keypunch operator. This one's the real McCoy 
Colossus-The Forbin Project, although slightly dated as regards today's computer technology, is nevertheless a science fiction classic. This movie was derived from the novel bearing the same title, and is a very faithful, and effective, reproduction of the novel. The premise is simple--what will be earth's next dominant species after mankind? The answer? Mankind will be succeeded by, and dominated by, the artificial intelligences that mankind itself creates. The film effectively tells the story as to how such a thing could come about. This is a chilling tale of the end of human dominance of the earth and the beginning of the dominance of the earth's new masters. The acting and direction in this film are quite good, and manage to make this tale seem quite believable. What a shame this DVD is not a full-screen reproduction of the film, and is instead reformatted for the TV screen. It is painfully obvious to the viewer that one is not seeing the entire picture, and it is inexplicable that this DVD did not offer the full reproduction of the film in filmscreen aspect. Perhaps someday such a reproduction will be offered. When it is, many of us will want to snap it up. This annoying and significant imperfection aside, this is a very enjoyable viewing experience, a good film, well worth repeated viewings and a must in the science fiction afficianado's collection 
This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous. But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list. The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer. This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick 
OK, I'm a SciFi fan. I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end. Just one problem, they forgot to write the end. What happened? Did they run out of money? Did the writer write himself into a corner? There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution. You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan scan." I prefer movies with an ending. If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you 
She's built like a 12-year-old boy... give me Vida Guerra anyday 
Teri Hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money. But for her, and her ample body on ample display, this movie is just not worth the time. Terrible direction, awful story, miserable music!! 
Good movie, good cast, but most of all the best part is Teri Hatcher naked throughout 
Silly trite, but sexy and a good time. Grab the candy bowl, butter the popcorn. This is a must for any and all Teri Hatcher fans and is pretty good B-movie fare - a very decent performance from Mizz Hatcher, both in and out of clothes 
This film is absolutely HOT!! The film is so full of erotic tension, even when there's 'nothing actually happening' (!). For that, the erotic appeal, I give it 5 stars, even though the story gets a bit unsatisfactory towards the end. It feels like it was originally different and some essential scenes were cut. But I can't say much more without giving too much away. I love the very ending, though! Calls for a sequel, really, which unfortunately never happened. I would have loved to see Robert Patrick in more steamy action... So, if you want to see two very good-looking people involved in loads of hot situations and talking - this is a film to get. Might be that the story is a bit confused - but who cares??? It's certainly not boring 
I have to say that even though Teti Hatcher's performance was good the movie itself was terrible. The plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable. I can;t believe I wasted my money on this one 
A thief is caught stealing a few coins, but fastinates the Lord because he resembles Lord Takeda Shingen. The thief faces death by cruxification. The double pleads for his life calling Shingen wicked. Shingen admits he is wicked banishing his father and punishing his son. Nobukado, Shingen brother saves the double because of his resemblance to Shingen. The thief will act as a Kagemusha warrior confusing Shigen enemies: Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Shingen desires to occupy Kyoto and place his flags in the domain. However, Nobunaga and Ieyasu are blockaded by Shingen, who has cut off the water aquifers, and holding them in control. Shingen exposes himself to hear a flute player. A marks man, manages to use a cord and stone marker correctly targeting Shingen, as he sits listening to the flute player; Shingen is injured. Shingen tells his general Yamagata and his son Kataysu that the armies are not to know he has died for three years, too preserve the Takeda clan. Nobukado surrounds the double with three skilled warriors and three pages, who will teach the double all the philosophy and behaviors of Shingen, too the double. The double learns why he is called the mountain monkey, the military tactics of infantry, calvery, and defensive positioning. The grandson and rightful heir, exposes the double as an imposter, but the generals and advisors convinces the young boy that his grandfather has been sick and away for along time and this is the cause of the visual differences. Shingen's mistress immediately complains that the double is an imposter, but when the double tells her the mistress the truth, but the truth is too impossible to believe and the group laughs in disbelief. Ieysu sends spies to determine, if Shingen is dead. The spies see a large vase dumped into the lake. The double tells the general/advisors the spies saw the large vase being dumped in the lake. The general/advisors announce the vase was an offering of sake to the lake God. The double attends a play where the spies get a good look at him. The spies conclude Shingen must be alive. Ieyasu abandon's Nobunaga believing Shingen is not dead. The defensive tactics look like the Takeda plan will work. Shingen strategy of defending the domain would preserve the clan. However, Kataysu ambitions would defy his fathers plans and create chaos for the general/advisor. Kataysu defys the orders of the Generals, his father last wish, and the advisors and launches an attack against nishino Castle. Ieyasu immediately immobilizes his troups to surround Kataysu. Kataysu tells the general, "the family has fought many battles and never lost and he plans on taking back lost property in the domain". General Yamagata realizes they have no choice but to rescue Kataysu and declare this will be the end too that Takeda clan: "wind, fire, and earth". The Shingen army arrives protecting Kataysu from the rear. Kataysu is infuriated he can't manage to win the battle by himself and remains in the protective shadow of his father. The army deflects an attack from the right and from the front, many men die protecting the double. The double believes his value is equal to the great Lord Shingen. The double shouts out, "do not move"! Kataysu manages to survive the battle. The double in his arrogance attempts to ride the Lord's horse, a horse only Lord Shingen has managed to ride. The horse throws the double to the ground and the mistresses see that the double has no shoulder scare. The double is banished from the castle with a few gifts from the generals. The film has a bizzare, strange, ridiculous surreal dream where shingen is attempting to kill the double. The scene is weird and serves no purpose in the story 
I am slowly wading through the huge backlog of Kurosawa Akira films that I have accumulated over the last few years. Last week I watched Rashomon for the second time and now I have finally watched the three hour long epic Kagemusha. I am glad I had to watch it for a class because three hours is quite a chunk of time. However, Kagemusha is quite a beautiful and entertaining film threaded with humor and sadness so its three hour time does not seem quite as long as it is. Opening with one long static shot, the viewer is presented with three men who practically look identical sporting the same kimono, hair style, and beard. We soon learn that the center figure is the warlord Takeda Shingen, the man on the left is his brother Nobukado, and the man on the right is a thief who was saved by Nobukado from being crucified because of his uncanny resemblance to Shingen. Nobukado desires to make the thief into a kagemusha, e*ï¿½Zï¿½, shadow warrior, like himself so he can act as a double for Shingen. Shingen is against the idea at first, but is soon impressed by a loud outburst from the thief so he allows the man to be trained as his double. On the verge of achieving his dream of overtaking Kyoto and keeping his enemies Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu at bay, Shingen leaves the safety of his abode to listen to the flute played by an enemy with the confines of a blockaded castle. However, Shingen is shot and subsequently dies. Yet before he passes away he tells his men to keep his death for a secret for three years. With no other option available the ranking generals of Shingenfs army keep their lordfs death a secret and force the thief to play the role of Shingen. However, this is easier said that donec Considered by critics and fans alike to be one of Kurosawafs most powerful, if more formulaic films, Kagemusha delves into the recesses of history and asks the questions what happened to Shingen? Why did he fail when he was so close to victory? However, this is only a small part of the films appeal. It, like many other Kurosawa films, shows how modernity, in this film rifles, impend on a culture. A great film that can be enjoyed at a number of levels, Kagemusha is a film to be watched not only by those who enjoy Kurosawa or samurai films, but by those who enjoy long epic films as well.  
The mortally wounded Lord Shingen (Tatsuya Nakadai), engaged in strife with two opposing warlords for control of feudal Japan, commands that his death be kept a secret for three years in order to prevent both disarray among his clan and conquest by his enemies. Upon his death, his kagemusha, or double (Nakadai again)--a lowly thief with a startling resemblance to the lord--takes over under the strict supervision of Shingen's closest associates. This visually striking film explores the extent to which a person's identity is constructed by others. The double begins to impress those around him as he seems to grow into the role, even winning the devotion of Shingen's grandson. The man and his social position become blurred until it becomes unclear which is the real person. When the double is unceremoniously humiliated and ejected from the palace toward the end, I could almost imagine that the rage of those who pelted him with stones was also repressed anger against the real Lord Shingen. When the double witnesses the tragic fate of the Takeda clan at the end of the film, it is as if the ghost of Shingen himself has appeared to witness the end of all his dreams. A powerful, thought-provoking, and moving film 
I knew that Akira Kurosawa's "Kagemusha" (1980) had some basis in history, but I didn't know how much until I listened to this DVD's audio commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince ("The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa"). According to Prince, virtually the entirety of the film's story is based on historical events -- the major exception being the character of the thief who acts as the double of Shingen, the warlord. However, Shingen, a historical figure, had employed doubles in real life, so Kurosawa's fictionalizing of the title character isn't that much of an embellishment. What makes Prince's commentary so outstanding is his in-depth knowledge of Japanese history. The historical events chronicled in the film are well-known to a Japanese audience, but they're unfamiliar to the average Western viewer. So, Kurosawa's often unconventional depiction of these events are frequently lost on non-Japanese audiences. For example, according to Prince, the wounding by gunfire of Shingen as he listens to an enemy's flute marks a monumental event in Japanese history. But Kurosawa portrays the event only in an oblique manner: by having the sniper who shot Shingen re-enact the shooting for Ieyasu Tokugawa (another historical figure, and the eventual winner of the wars that Kurosawa depicts). Just imagine a film about Abraham Lincoln that dramatizes his assassination by having it re-created by Secret Service agents, and you'll get an idea of Kurosawa's inventiveness. Prince discusses some off-screen historical events that were going on the same time as the incidents in the film, giving the listener a much broader understanding of both history and Kurosawa's accomplishment. Also, Prince talks in depth about some of the artistic license that Kurosawa has taken with non-fictional events. After listening to the commentary, I came away with a much deeper appreciation for "Kagemusha." Since so much has already been said about the film itself, I will only add this: It's unfortunate that Shintarï¿½ Katsu, who was originally cast in the title role and is best-known for starring in the Zatoichi film series, was fired by Kurosawa before filming began in earnest. Tatsuya Nakadai, who replaced Katsu, is a superb actor, but his screen presence doesn't have the comic warmth that Katsu could have brought to the role -- and that I think would have enhanced the film. (And at the risk of infuriating Nakadai fans everywhere, I would also prefer to have seen his lead role in Kurosawa's "Ran" played by Toshirï¿½ Mifune.) I can't watch "Kagemusha" without wondering how the film might have looked if Kurosawa and Katsu hadn't quarreled. Otherwise, "Kagemusha" is among Kurosawa's best period films. Even if you already own "Kagemusha" on tape, this Criterion DVD might be worth renting for Prince's commentary alone. (Disclaimer: I do not know Stephen Prince personally, nor do I have any vested interest in his work.) 
Kagemusha is my eighth Kurosawa DVD and it holds #1 position in my collection. Kurosawa was a painter before he became a cinematographer, then writer and director, and his artistic background is evident in the use of color and perspective in this film. It is a treat for the eyes. The film differs from Ran, the director's wonderful version of King Lear, in that it is a drama built around historical records and tradition.It is a compelling story that left me emotionally spent at the end. The first time I watched the DVD, I played the Japanese audio track and read the English subtitles. This was not at all difficult, for the subtitles are clearly visible in all scenes. The second time through the DVD, I turned on the English commentary and watched the action on screen as everything was explained to me in marvelous detail. My third time through the DVD was with the Japaenese audio, and a greatly improved understanding of what was going on, especially the nuanced moments. Color quality and cinematography are magninficent. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Samarai films and/or the work of Akira Kurosawa. 
A film of great beauty and rhythm. The turmoil of that era of Japanese history comes through with force and mastery. Trickery of warfare only began with the Trojan Horse, has its own version in Kagemusha, and continues to our time 
I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from. 
Kagemusha is not a 5 star movie. It is a big step down from Ran (which is very similar in many aspects, but has a great story) and Seven Samurai (a very different and more comedic, earlier movie by Kurosawa). Kagemusha has two major problems. The story is quite simplistic, a big problem with a three hour movie. Incredible visuals and excellent production quality carry much of the movie; there are a few really great scenes, as can be expected of any Kurosawa movie. But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4-star territory, and that is the ludicrous final battle. There's a lot worth remembering in Kagemusha, but the crazy ending, unfortunately, sticks in the mind. The Criterion edition is of excellent quality. The transfer and sound quality are first-rate, and the additional material is interesting and well done. Add-ons cannot make a 4-star movie, even so, into a 5-star experience. There are many positive aspects to Kagemusha, and any Kurosawa fan will be happy with this DVD set. But for those new to Kurosawa, I strongly recommend Ran or Seven Samurai instead 
OK, I love Japanese film and Kurosawa is my favorite Japanese director, but even a newbie to film will be hooked. I loved every aspect of this film....script, cinematography, acting, score, choreography, sound, and of course - direction! This is the complete Japanese version, includes film not seen in the original US release. Criterion has put together a great package, the quality of this DVD makes it worth the price. Included in the specials feature is a terrific commentary track, one of the best I've heard covering every aspect of the film, Kurosawa, Japanese history and Japanese film history. Only negative I could consider is its somewhat stagy, slow opening act...I loved this scene, especial since most of it was new to me (not in original us release) but someone new to Japanese film might find it dull going and give up on the film before the momentum builds. It builds in the next scene! A great movie, in complete form, presented in near pristine condition by a film master in top form. This is a 5 star release at any price! For those of you complaining about the price...rent it! 
FIRST OFF: "The Man in the Moon", is a great film! With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot. IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below] Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old. The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?! THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below] Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens. Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man. Robert Mulligan - Director Sam Waterston - Matthew Trant Tess Harper - Abigail Trant Gail Strickland - Marie Foster Reese Witherspoon - Dani Trant Jason London - Court Foster Emily Warfield - Maureen Trant Bentley Mitchum - Billy Saunders ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER SPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MORE BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT This is quite a little story with a big punch. The supporting roles are impeccably played with Sam Waterston playing Matthew Trant, the father, and Tess Harper playing Abigail Trant, as the mother. They have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in Louisiana. 
I loved the setting of this movie; it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds I enjoy hearing. The pace was relaxed but not dull at all. The plot was sweet, the acting well done. Reese Witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie, her first major role. 
I LOVED this movie. Breathtaking scenery, a simple yet enthralling story, and wonderful acting all around. No drugs, no guns, no over-the-top violence. A nice movie to watch on a rainy day.... 
I love this little story of the relationship between two sisters. The performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting. It still gets me : 
I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time. A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message 
I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it. Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father. I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon). A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film. Rings true to life. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame 
This is a masterpiece of cinema. After watching Robert Mulligan's more famous (to me) movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of '42, I found this jewel. I did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is. Directors like Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch or Vidor and Capra are long gone, and so is cinema as art, but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it, although it may only last a blink of an eye. I am off to check out "Come September" now. Who is this Robert Mulligan, anyway? Lovable little gem 
The last few times we've seen the words "directed by Wes Craven" on anything, it hasn't really been anything to write home about. From the Scream trilogy to the debacle that was Cursed, it seemed like Craven had lost his edge. The man who brought us terrifying, exploitation films like Last House on the Left and the Hills Have Eyes, along with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street, may not go for the throat like he used to, but Red Eye is as close a return to form for the director that we'll get for a while. Hottie Rachel McAdams stars as a hotel manager catching the red eye flight back home, and soon enough she turns the tables on the psychopath (Cillian Murphy, more menacing and eerie looking than in Batman Begins if you can believe that) looking to assassinate her father (Brian Cox). There's really nothing we haven't seen before in Red Eye, but under Craven's guiding hand the tension and suspense are superbly crafted. McAdams and Murphy are quite good as well, and the film is short but sweet, clocking in at under an hour and a half. All in all, there may well be hope yet for Craven's future films, and anyone looking for some great suspense should definitely check this out 
This is, in my opinion, the best movie of Summer 2004! Way better than that overrated "Dukes Of Hazzard" [...] of a movie. This is a totally original idea, and the action keeps you on the edge of your seat without ever dying down! It's not one of your typical crash or hijacked airllne movies. It takes a different direction in airplane movies with a large amount of great suspense! Great "spine shivering" script too 
I have hope that someday Wes Craven will return to greatness, that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like Scream 2, cursed, and Dracula 2000. I have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or "The Last House on the Left", but alas "Red Eye" fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies. First of all, the flick is PG-13, which means no blood, no sex, and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot. A pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes. I must admit there are directors that can pull off a PG-13 horror flick but Wes Craven is not one of the chosen few. As soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head, yeah it's that predictable. The main character Lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport. Her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight (creative title, huh) to visit daddy. Immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line, and he is obviously more than a destination point. While on the phone with Pops, Lisa puts him on hold to speak with Cynthia, a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip. Cynthia has to somehow be a victim. Next Lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane; he is obviously the bad guy. Not just because of the random circumstances, but he has those bad guy eyes. The movie is over from my point of view, besides a few inconsistencies, the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if Lisa and Cynthia don't work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel. Now we all know that this won't happen because all crappy movies have happy endings. That is why seven was a splendid film by the way, the villain was triumphant. The guy that sits next Lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie. It's all expected, and it's all dribble. Which may be why they made the movie PG-13, no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it. This movie could have been saved, if the villain had a better plan, if he was more convincing. If the protagonist wouldn't be so heroic if her morals wouldn't be so goody two shoes. If the movie wasn't so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable. 
I think this movie was great! The actors were fitted well and the story line exciting, not just Another Plane Movie
