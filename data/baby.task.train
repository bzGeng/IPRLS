1	item is exactly as pictured/described . cute design and good quality . adds a nice touch . highly recommend
1	this little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet , yet it is easy to take on and off . it also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat . very easy to clean as well . i will warn you that little boys can still `` shoot '' over the small guard . i am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the `` projection path '' is downward . i have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them . this seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable . because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat , too .
1	i received this stroller about a week ago , and so far , we love it . the ride is smooth , it 's very light , and i love the salmon color . the shade comes in handy , too . it has all the features i 'd want while still remaining ight and streamlined . it 's a little awkward to close , but i 'm a bit of a klutz , so i assume others might not have this problem . the handles are great , though , and they 're very comfortable for my husband ( 6 feet ) and me ( 5'7 '' . )
1	my son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver ! when i wrap him in it , he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time . he can easily break out of the swaddle me , but not the miracle blanket . i am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends ! !
0	i do n't care what other reviewers say , but this bed rail sucked ! ! i used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed . it took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed . and it would constantly come unlocked . and if i buy another bed rail for our next child it wo n't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty . i ca n't remember if this cover was removable or not , if it was i 'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove
1	i have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great . easy to use and quick to sterilise . with regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment , i should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile . all babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting , and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats ( and breast pump equipment ) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally . cleaning your baby 's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs , so it 's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing . if you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone , it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade . the bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition . it may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth , but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous . your baby 's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he 'll be able to combat infections more easily . it might seem inconvenient to some , but sterilising reduces your baby 's chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it 's about the baby 's health , not what the mother 's feels she doesnt have time for .
0	i was really unhappy with this lock . it not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well
0	i bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage . i 'm a 38 dd and use the large flange for my medela pump , so i too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple . the ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable , although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend ( great proper latch ! ) , and treatment for a mild yeast infection . hope this helps
0	this is an okay product with many , many parts to clean . the spout , the ring for the top of the cup , the handles , and the plastic `` leak stopper '' , oh , and the cup ! all the parts fly around the dishwahser . i 've lost many stoppers so i 've had to order through avent . the good thing is they do n't leak .
1	i decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once . this pump works very well and i quickly get the milk i need . i like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort . i gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied . sometimes one side looses suction and while i am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because i had to remove my hand from holding it in place
1	this pillow works ! sleeping in the car used to make my son cranky becausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss cry . now with this comfy pillow , he naps peacefully wakes up happy
1	i am a pretty picky shopper , but i have fallen in love with this product . my now 6 1/2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place i could ever get her to sleep comfortably . she still sleeps in it ( at 18 pounds , it is still safe up to 25 or when they can crawl out ) . there is a cushion for newborns and it is removable for use for older babies . save the money you 'd spend on a co-sleeper , swing or a bassinet and try this instead . i buy it for every baby shower i attend .
1	we got this when our baby was about 6 months old , he is now 9 months . at first , he was n't sure what to do , but once he figured out how to jump in it , it was all he wanted to do . the adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it . it 's a little awkward to move around , but the enjoyment well out-weighs that .
1	i have recently had my fifth child and so i have experienced many baby items , including swings , and this one is the best ! it has a cushiony , comfy seat for baby with different recline options ; soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at ; several musical tunes with adjustable volume control . there is also a dial to set the swing motion -- to go slowly or faster -- and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side , or front to back . sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back , and she 'll cry -- we then change the swing position to go side to side , and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep . and vice versa , sometimes we put her in side to side , and she wants to swing front to back -- how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she 's in the mood for ! as my husband says , `` this is the best money we 've ever spent !
1	i 've tried other cart covers and this one is the nicest . it 's big and , well , floppy ! it 's padded so it keeps my son comfortable . you can put it on the cart with one hand . i have to put my son in and then do the seat belt through the back . it works great . we leave it in the car and use it everywhere . i bought it because when my other son was a baby he got really sick a few days after a trip to the grocery store . i 've seen programs about what 's on those cart seats ( people put their raw meat in that section of the cart all the time - yuck ) i feel much safer now ! !
1	good baby monitor overall . sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and i ca n't find where the interference is coming from
0	i have looked everywhere and there are no probe covers to be found anywhere ! who would sell a $ 30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times ! this is insane . if anyone finds them , please let me know where . i have checked babysrus , usa baby , wal-mart , target , walgreens , snyder 's drugstores , every grocery store , every discount store , every drugstore i have been to in two states over the last 3 months . this is crazy . i recommend not getting it
1	we bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline , was lightweight , and continues to be a functional , comfortable stroller for our son . the one feature that i expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined ... it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go . i was happy with the amount of storage , but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag . all in all , we are very happy with this purchase !
0	i own these bottles they seemed nice.but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean.i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle.im thowing mine out
1	my baby outgrew the regular sized swaddle me at 2 months of age . i ordered this one and when it came in the mail i could n't believe how huge it looked ! we did n't actually use it until about 2.5-3 months since it was so big . we would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it was n't as long . at 3.5 months , our baby weighs 17 pounds so it 's hard to find something to swaddle him with , and he still needs it . i hope he does n't outgrow this one in the near future . i think he 'll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he 's 6 months old and this blanket should work
0	this was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $ 5.00 at any hardware store . it cost me a total of $ 23.00 after shipping for this product . it does n't even look like the picture . it is n't black with angelcare written on it . it is literally a normal , brown piece of board . it 's blatant false advertizing . i feel sick , not to mention a total idiot for thinking i would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor . if you have the angelcare movement sensor monitor and do n't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard . do not buy this . it is a disgrace
1	baby is happy , eating well . what better praise for a bottle nipple can be given ? note : fast flow is for age six months and up , the slow/medium flow nipples by avent are just as good ( just for younger babies
1	my daughter received these instruments as a gift last christmas and took to them right away . she was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds . we have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites , just the right colors , size and shape with just the right sounds ! she has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys . they really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children
1	we love the swaddle me blankets . we have the flannel and the fleece . this has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night ( in just two weeks of using them ) . she loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again . with the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer . the fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat . have not tried the cotton ones . definitely worth a try
0	we went through three of these before we finally gave up . our poor baby was crying and we did n't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night . i luckily am a light sleeper . also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near . we bought a cheaper , safety first brand and have not had any problems
1	i just received my travel set today and i already love it ! the bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle i have . the pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house . i highly recommend it
1	we purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well . we have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter . my husband installed it easily ( one end into a stud in the wall , one end into an oak stair banister ) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle , it has shown no signs of dislodging . i give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome ( and tough for guests to figure out ) . but it definitely does its job and i would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover
0	definately not a potty for boys . as with other reviewers , the shield does not stay on . looking for another simple and basic potty now : o
1	i have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room . i have read countless reviews of the `` double faced tape foam pads '' that come off right away with little effort . this product attached exactly as described . i had the unit installed as well as the pads measured , cut and installed in 10 minutes . the taupe color is very discrete on our cream , red black brick fireplace . i ca n't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried . great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced . an absolute must for your hearth .
1	my son loves this mobile , it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around .
0	wow- cheap plastic , poorly routed holes , took 1/2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction - sent it back - my daughter loved the dora picture and was very sad that she could n't keep it
0	the idea is good ... but it does not sit well on oblong toilets . the adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus . would recommend with round toilet only
0	our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges would n't stay in place . i love the idea , but it just did n't work for us
0	i bought this for my daughter while i was still pregnant , thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months ( as well as later ) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o . son . it certainly was n't cheap , so i assumed that it would be a good product , and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants . do n't let the product description fool you ! just as it says in some of the other reviews , it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling , because of it 's crappy strap tightener . my daughter was a small newborn , only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months , which was the first time i tried using the sling . and even being that small , for the 2 minutes i had the sling on i could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen . ( definitely not safe ! ) aside from that , this item is so big and bulky that i literally could not even see my daughter in it . i might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it . there would n't have been much difference between the two . i would strongly advise that you do not purchase this product ! i want to get rid of mine , since it 's brand new , but i threw away the box so i ca n't return it . and i absolutely can not , in good concience , sell it to anyone else for their child . so , i have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash . do n't make the same mistake i did !
1	i tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing . even the playtex nursers which i liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son . i had received a free avent nurser , so i tried it and the problem was eliminated . i bought the newborn set and some extras , not cheap , but worth it for a content baby ! i was quite upset when they began leaking , then i discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you do n't tighten as much as possible , if you tighten avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn , they do n't leak ! no gas , no leaks , happy baby
1	my son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers , he just wont sit in them ; so this product was our solution for him when we are out . it is small , but my son ( 20 months old ) fits fine in it ! the problem is i ca n't find the liners anywhere .
1	we have the baby bjorn step stool , potty chair , little potty , and now the toilet trainer . hind sight is 20/20 . the toilet trainer and step stool is all you need . our initial thought was to have the potty chair for home and the little potty for trips . the reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like mommy and daddy . we balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer . no more balancing acts on the toilet . she can use her step stool to get on the toilet when she wants . the toilet trainer travels well , fits all types of toilets , easy to install , remove , and clean ! the potty chair and little potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the toilet trainer from the start
1	my granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs , she had no problem with the soothie bottle , the pacifer she loves , the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding , like the little cups to hold the powder formual .have n't had a problem with the bottles leaking . love the ones with the designs of winnie-the-pooh on them , wish they came in the 3 bottle set , also wish you could buy the little snack ( formula ) containers seperately not just in the large sets . would recommend for any baby .
0	some assembly is required . i consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things ... i have an engineering degree ... i 've put together bikes , furniture , installed car stereos , and this thing was an absolute pain , especially for such a simple device . i found the instructions to be woefully inadequate . i found the images to be useless , and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how to orient various pieces together . takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance . it was aggravating enough to make me go straight to amazon upon finishing to leave feedback ... i did n't even buy it from amazon . the gate itself is fine
0	the idea of a nice warm wipe is great , but the product falls short in perfomance . the warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box . ( if you use pop up wipes , just the part sticking out of the box gets warm , and the rest is cold . if you use the other type of wipe box , it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full , which is n't always realistic for a moms and dads . i am returning mine to the store . :
1	we purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago . for perspective , we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son 's car seat along . this carrier has been indispensable for us . it fits our large britax roundabout , plus has space for a bag of diapers , soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips . we use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes . as our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane , we simply check it through as a piece of luggage . the material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag , but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread . we just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well
1	i had a hard time finding a play pen for my grand daughter . there are many pack n play items but i wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago . this one was exactly what i wanted . she has room to roll around and play with toys and it 's easy to set up and take down
1	when my son was born in may i tried the dr brown 's bottles based on a co-worker 's recommendation , and i am so glad i did ! my kids are all primarily breastfed , but for times when i need a bottle , dr. brown 's are now the only ones i will use . my son is almost 4 months old now , and has had very little gas , and has never had any problems with colic ! i wish i had had these bottles when my other children were babies . as for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. puh-leeze ! i hand-wash all my baby 's bottles anyway , but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with ? ? dr. brown 's makes it as easy on the parents as possible , but who does n't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best ? with the little brush to use on the straw and vents , it really takes no time at all , so stop the nonsense . anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up one at least , but i know you will go out and get more if you do
0	i thought that this bathtub would be the best thing , because of the shower and spa feature . but the shower is so hard to use , it 's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time . you also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling , beacause it 's just not positiioned right , it sits too high up , and she just looks uncomfortable on it . you also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit . it was n't worth $ 40 , the sling , and the spa and shower unit is n't useful or helpfula t all
0	ok , this chair is fine except for two very important things . one : the tray is huge , and not in a good way , in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way . also , the two trays that fit on top , that are dishwasher safe , are too big to fit in the dishwasher ! ! ! so what 's the point ? ? ? two : it has the little thing that separates the legs on the tray , rather than on the chair ... making it impossible to set down anywhere when it 's full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair . everything else , about the chair is great , but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair . i 'm bought the one that 's made by the famous toy maker , and love it
0	i used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since i 'm engorged and found out the motor is broken . i 'm very disappointed since i trusted the medela name . if i could afford it , i 'd replace it with the pump-in-style , but unfortunately , i 'll have to try a manual pump
0	first off , the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on ? yeah , i 'd call him creative , but not the one who 'invented ' that trick . i had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly ... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick . secondly , the liners are too expensive , and third , how in the world do you mix formula in these things ? they worked great for breastmilk , but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid . even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long . give me the regular bottles any day . ps- bisphenol-a ... what about high fructose corn syrup , cargeenan ( which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative ) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield ! i 'm all for protecting your kids but you ca n't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there
0	so ... i bought this for our 7 month old . what a nightmare . what the previous posters said about this thing is true . it is hard to get it to stay put in the cart while you put your kid in it . it just does n't happen . and then ... when you do get your baby in , the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child 's hind end . forget the bar cover . it is just as narrow . this thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine , they are reaching over and touching everything . to add to it , the back cusion part does n't even go up to the top of the back support . my daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed . the cusion part totally does n't cover it . just bad . just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart
1	this is a great item , but , it does have some flaws . i got this for my 2 month old , and he loved it ! now he 's 6 months and loves it just as much . the thing is , you need to manually push the button , and then you can use the remote . after it plays all the music , and it shuts off , the only way to turn it back on , is to press the button yourself . not great when you 're flying on the freeway ! but , it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it ... the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it . i keep all of the `` out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~ ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff ... also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be !
0	i have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months ( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily ) . suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend . my dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me . thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good . he replaced `` just the pump '' in the pack with a new one . per medela 's instructions , they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it , if it was under a yr old . it would have been very late for me if i were to ship it and they have to ship it back . another thing that is happening is my back pack 's handles have started wearing down . and i hardly carry them around . i am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump . i would think twice before buying this
1	we took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at disney world it was great ! ! it held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc . i am very pleased with this purchase . it was great to have it in the airport too . the only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked , but we can get a replacement .
1	my daughter loves this activity center . i wish they would change two things about it . i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up
1	my wife and i ( yep a guy reviewing a kids toy ! ) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece . she is absolutely hooked on it . having a relatively short attention span with most toys , it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her . just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy ! the big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well . when she gets bored , learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy ! ! playing is easy , you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now . with my wife 4 months pregnant , we have ordered another already . only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note ( red tentacle ! )
0	my neighbor had the nojo and liked it so i was going to get one too . i tried hers , but i could n't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which did n't seem safe and hurt my back . i thought i could order a different size , but found it only comes in one size . i then read all the reviews here and followed someone 's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings . it fit me better ( i 'm petite ) and was a lot easier to use ( and prettier ! ) . i think it makes a big difference to get a sling that 's not bulky and comes in sizes - i do n't get why they use so much padding in the nojo , it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings .
1	i borrowed this pump from a mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work . i used it frequently ( at least twice daily ) for the 5 months i pumped at work . it always worked wonderfully . i never had trouble with let-down or supply . sometimes i filled both 8 oz . bottles in a 15-minute session ! unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply , i ca n't imagine this pump not working great . i did n't have any problems with it the whole time i used it
0	i don not like these washes at all . the scent is very very overpowering ! ! ! ! ! i had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong . i do love the case though . it is sturdy and has lots of room
1	before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier , my husband and i used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut . it kept the seat clean ( and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean ) , but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport . then i found out about car seat carriers , and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews . it was purchased just before a trip to colorado , and has since also been to europe and back . i 'm extremely happy with this item . it 's relatively easy to put our convertible evenflo car seat into , and the canvas and zippers have held up well , with no obvious signs of wear yet , even after braving the luggage belts . the only tip i can give people is that my husband and i found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position ( much like small wheelie carry on luggage ) , and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far , so that it 's center of gravity is lower . so you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further . both my husband and i were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably . for anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along , i definitely recommend this product
0	i ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems ! the two major problems with this product is that 1 . ) it 's quite bulky , and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway , and 2 . ) check if it will fit in your carseat . i have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide , and you ca n't leave the pillows in place , they stand up at a 45 degree angle . i attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place . this works , but obviously only if you 're sitting next to them when they fall asleep ! other than that you 'd have to stop the car , get out and attach them , then go again , by which time the child is probably awake anyway ! to be honest , i have n't seen a better alternative yet though . it 's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though
0	did not work at all ! had to return it ! we prefer the `` tinkle toons '' potty with a moisture sensor . the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work
1	we just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters - they 're great . they 're strong enough to keep our 11-month-old baby from falling through -- we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened . i still intend to watch him carefully when he 's up there , but these will definitely protect him in an emergency . just be sure to follow directions -- tie them tightly ! ! they 're not that bad , looks-wise , either . i can still see my spindles through the netting so the `` look '' of the stairway is basically unchanged . of course , looks are less important than safety ! i think i 'm going to get these for our outdoor deck , as well . i 'd recommend them
1	it fits our baby trend car seat , hooks easily to the latch anchor points , and in our mid-size sedan , leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side
1	my son is a very picky eater but loves elmo . this set is adorable and practical . he loves the spoon and getting his food off the plate and bowl . th eonly thing to be ware of is -- it gets very hot in the microwave . even if you just put it in for 20 seconds , it must cool dow
0	this sheet is cheap , ugly , and scratchy . instead , buy a portable crib sheet , they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors . they are softer and more durable
0	my daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times ! i am returning it first thing in the morning . i should have never let her on it a second time . if she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over . please do not buy this product
1	my eight-month-old daughter really loves these instruments ! we bought them when she was about four months old , but when she picked them up she 'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around . i brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control . now she really goes wild with them , especially the bells !
0	had to return this item . it was way too small . forewarned when you order that it wo n't fit an average baby up to six months . i would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most ! ! it is very cute and would be a great addition to a bundleme ( cover ) , but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing . more disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a $ 9 item .
1	this gate is easy to install and simple to operate once you get the hang of how it works . my son is one and half years old and has a tendency to rush gates ( he 's broken two already ... ) and so far , this one 's holding up . i would not recommend anyone use it at the top of stairs because it does n't have an installation kit , but for hallways and at the bottom of the stairs it works really well . it swings closed on its own and is pretty loud if you let it slam shut ... we use ours in the kitchen so it does n't wake the babies up- however , if you were to use it in a hallway near where your kids are sleeping , it might be loud enough to disturb their sleep . all in all , it 's a really good deal and i would highly recommend this product
0	we are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks . we bought the mattress for our delta marisa white crib , and ( you guessed it ) it does n't fit . i read the review of another poster here and it says it does n't fit their thomas the tank engine toddler bed . the poster assumed that it may fit a baby 's crib , but the honest truth ; its one inch ( possibly more ) off . an inch is enough for our baby 's foot to get stuck in it , and the mattress feels like a joke , its too cushiony . we regret not reading the reviews before buying it . if this mattress does n't fit the majority of cribs/beds , then what is it good for
1	while these are n't waterproof , they provide enough additional protection to give you a little more confidence in going out of the house in underwear . so soft , and a little more absorbent than the gerber ones . they are n't as trim a fit as some of the other brands , but my son really likes the roomy feel
0	this piece took forever to assemble , arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces . the directions are vague ... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle ! but the actual parts are n't labeled , so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean . when finished , all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it ... they have no bolts to hold them in , the just sit in shallow slots . the drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable . also , as many of the holes are not lined up , so i could n't even put in some of the bolts .
0	the leak-o-matic fully lived up to its name . as a new parent , i do n't have time to do things once , forget about doing things twice . i need simple and reliable- the leak-o-matic is neither . it worked ok for the first few times , then i partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime . by the time i returned with baby in hand , the leak-o-matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter , soaked all my other items on the counter , water ran down onto the floor , under the baseboard , and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor . the leak-o-matic is the hindenburg of all baby bathtubs . it is too bad that i can not give it zero stars . there are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly , but judging from the number of irate mommies here , i conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering . think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese ! the cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached . the fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water , so you 're always repositioning the baby . i 'm surprised that this thing did n't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety ' . i did not research every single item on the registry- i figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least `` ok '' . back it goes . if you buy this thing , then good luck to you , and do n't burn the toast !
1	if you 're going to get the baby bjorn potty chair , you 've got to get a matching stool ! i love how the stool has a rubbery-grip top to prevent slipping . my son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair . you 've got ta get one now
1	as im sure all mothers can relate , my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart . i looked at a lot of local stores for a cover . i couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt $ 80 . this one is great ! its reasonably priced , wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings . i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around , but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts ! !
0	i bought this doll because at the expensive price , i figured it would be the best . it definitely is not . patty is cute , but that is the only good thing about her . to fill up her bottles , you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water , then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again . it requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water , no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes . then , to feed patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle , where she is almost standing up . most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms , but patty will not drink in that position . even in the standing up position , most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit . it takes 5-10 minutes to fill patty up . most children do n't have the patience for this and lose interest , as my daughter did . plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle , only an adult can feed patty her water . then , to make her pee , you must press her thigh very hard . this distressed my daughter because she thought i was hurting patty . once i assured her patty was ok , then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make patty pee . my daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier . at 35 months old , my daughter was not able to fill the bottles , feed patty or make her pee . only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of patty . so my daughter quickly lost interest in patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles . the whole `` teach the doll to pee '' part of the potty training was lost . i wish i had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead . then i e-mailed the company to complain , but of course received no response . and you ca n't get a full refund if the doll has been used . in fact , getting a refund at all is extremely difficult , i have just given up on that . do n't waste your money . this doll is too expensive and can not be used by a child , which defeats the whole purpose . go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll . at least that way , if you do n't like it you can return it , unlike patty
1	this seems to be a secure seat , and our almost-5-year old is comfortable in it . the buckling system is a bit inconvenient - you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped . i wish our son could buckle himself in at this point , but this seat makes it too hard . it 's also not a seat you want to do air travel with , as it 's unwieldy to carry around . but , all in all i would say it 's a good purchase
1	i did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn , and the snugfit got the best safety reviews . and we just loved the pring- perfect for a boy or a girl . i had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car , but it was a breeze . i had it installed in the backseat within five minutes . my car has the latch system , and it has worked great . my daughter loves being in her car seat , and i have always felt perfectly safe with her in it . i was surprised to read the other reviews , since i have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat . i would highly recommend this seat to any parent
0	i purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my delta luv changing table , because there was no storage space on top . i had high hopes for it -- munchkin products are usually high in quality . however , the cloth on this organizer sags . when i tried to fill it with my wipes box , baby powder , and lotion -- as shown in the picture -- the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out . i would n't want a toddler getting near this organizer ! a much safer option is the plastic `` diaper depot '' by prince lionheart
0	i got this toy for my brother , who is 4 . the buttons were hard to press , the stickers didnt stick , it used many batteries , and it makes noise i guess its supposed to talk but all i hear come out if muffly speaking like a bad radio signal . save ur money ! buy something else
0	we had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out . called customer service , and they said it is n't a replaceable part . too bad . it was easy enough to install , and worked well up until it did n't anymore . the click is pretty loud ; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby . disappointed it did n't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and i still need a gate at the top of the stairs . i'l be replacing it with a different product , obviously
0	this is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason . the front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels do n't . just like a car , it can only go forward and backward , but not sideways . sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she ca n't push the walker that way because of the design , and she gets frustrated . if both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction , it would have had much greater mobility
1	we originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house , and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much . but , since my 2-month old still `` lives '' in our room , in her bassinet , that part has not yet been an issue . however , we keep this basket in our living room , fully stocked , and we do n't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper . ( sounds lazy , but if you already have kids , you understand ! ) the sides of the liner have pockets , which we use to hold hand sanitizer , diaper rash cream , a thermometer , baby brush , aspirator , baby nail clippers , lotion , a couple rattles/toys , and some chapstick and nursing pads for me . we put the diapers , a changing pad , and a wipe holder in the `` main '' center part . i also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle , and my baby loves to look at them while she 's getting her diaper changed . ( i put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them . ) the basket itself is well made , and i have no fears of it falling apart any time soon . ( in fact , we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers ! ) we have not yet had to wash the liner , but it appears to be well made , and i have no fears of it falling apart , although i am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle
0	we had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter . well , it is alot quieter than our monitor , but like others said , it makes this awful beeping noise ! it has gone off twice in the middle of the night before ! we also have another digital phone , so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel . i would look elsewhere for another monitor.. the beeping is what gets to me - i dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night !
1	we adopted a little boy when he was 2 days old . he was slightly preemie and weighed just over 5 pounds . he would n't have anything to do with the soothie for preemies , but loved the regular soothie pacifier even though it covered half his face . we had a hard time finding a bottle that he liked , he did n't seem to care for any of the nipples and we tried several : avent , dr. brown , gerber and playtex . i was strolling the baby aisle in target when i saw these and was thrilled . in the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon . i love the width of the bottles because it 's super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean . the lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing . our baby is now 8 weeks old and these are still doing well . this bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also . double check to make sure the top is on tight and you should n't have any leaking problems . i 'm so glad i found these !
1	i would n't call this a `` rocker seat '' the kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker , if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor . you can make it move a little if you have wood floors , but not enough to call it a rocker . if you have a very mellow baby , this chair is perfect . my baby likes to sit and stare at the toys . but if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm , i would n't recommend this chair . the music/sounds on it is very nice , not annoying at all . i do n't use the vibration on it yet , until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed . the only reason i say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a `` rocker '' , other than that , it is very cute , and my baby enjoys it alot !
1	i wish that it would zip up all the way ... the top is coming down all the time and i have to adjusted . maybe it 's better for a two and up age child .
0	i bought this but it 's junk . my husband and i have both tried it on ourselves and ca n't get it to register of 95 degrees . that 's not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one
0	this high chair was great to start , but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals . i thought it was me , at first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp . reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now , 3 months later , she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor . i am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground . if you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly , do n't buy this one . i am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself
0	overpriced ! not what i expected ! you ca n't really used it because it 's too small for big bellied pregnant women ! uncomfortable ! the velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy . yuck
0	i purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen . unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it , which makes it impossible to close with one hand . even if you do n't care about the one-hand feature , it is still a hassle to adjust . i do not suggest buying this gate .
1	not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly . i just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble . assemble is probably too strong a word , there is no actual assembly or tools involved . as for the weight , maybe 15 pounds , certainly nowhere near 50 . the instructions seemed sufficient although i did n't really need to use them . basically , if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern , do n't let that stand in the way of choosing this item .
1	all rubbery squirt toys have the issue of the black stuff , there 's no avoiding it . we squirt them til empty at the end of every bath . my kids love the net and little fish , as well as the other toys . no problem with paint loss on the net as of yet and we 've had it over 2 years .
0	i bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old . i ended up returning it 3 days later . i am a petite woman ( 5'2 '' ) and this item was totally uncomfortable ! i still have bruises under my arms from this item . i followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual . it bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits . i would not reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as i am . not worth the mone
0	this item was suggested to me by my local birth center . i should have noticed the word `` wrap '' , but i did n't give it too much thought . there are two main problems with this baby carrier : 1 . you have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house . i live in sw florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees . there is no way i could stand in a parking lot , wrap myself up , put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion . 2 . it is hot . yes , this is a nice , stretchy breathable fabric , but , the fabric is much , much bulkier than standard baby carriers . again , i hate to harp on the weather here , but there 's no way i could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all i had on underneath was a tank top . i 'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them . otherwise , you 'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them . on the plus side , it 's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of .
0	i bought this because i love all the other fisher price aquarium stuff we have . but ... we have n't been thrilled with this tub . the hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i 'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth ... so she used it like 2 weeks . even so , the hammock sags onto this hard bump in the middle of the hammock so the baby 's back rests on this bump . never seemed comfortable . then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she ca n't sit up to use the other side . there are better tubs out there
1	i tried to use my other kiddopotamus shade with my 16 mt old the other day while taking a stroll on the beach . he would not hear of it ! he wanted to see out ! ! i searched the web trying to find another shade to cover him - this was the answer ! ! i did not want to pay more than 20.00 for the shade and at 15.00 this is a bagin ! ! i have found it extemely easy to use on my baby jogger . one windy day it did blow in but that was ok with me because i knew it was also blocking the wind from my son 's face . if you are looking to extend your stroller 's shade area this is the product for you ! ! i only wish i had found it before i got rid of my inglesina stroller because i could not move the shade forward to block the son from my fair skinned child
1	this fit very easily into my daughter 's graco infant car seat . as the other reviewers said , it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm . wind has not seemed to be a problem , but then i only carry her between the car and my destination in it . i would recommend this to a friend
1	if they made one of these things for adults , i 'd get one ! ! my daughter loves this thing . it 's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love , and spins really easily . the colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands . i have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these
0	if i could have given this no stars i would have . this product in l-xl only fits a pre-pregnancy 28 '' -34 '' waist . and in sizes that only goes up to a 18 . so now i 'm on the search for something a little bit bigger . so if your pre-pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side , dont waste your money or time by getting this
0	this was given to me as a gift , and although i have used it , it would not be my first choice in infant care . the nail clippers are mediocre at best , i understand they should n't be sharp for an infant but i have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son 's nails . the syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers could n't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip . i have never used the brush , comb or toothbrush ( i have others ) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering ! the case is cumbersome and of poor design . everytime i open it - everything falls out !
0	this stroller is made of very cheap material . merely after a few months of light use , the stroller is already hard to push , and wheels are easily stuck whenever i try to make a turn . even for a less than half-an-inch road bump , i have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass . the shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven , and the outside fabrics is already worn out . not to mention , the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small . without buying an extention shade , they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller . it is definitely not worth the price . btw , their customer service is terrible as well .
0	worst product ever ! safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all . i 'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub . my 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister . yeah , ouch ! ! ! the stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves -- snap ! it pinches their private part . everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried . i realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar . ouch ! it still makes me grit my teeth when i think about it . horrible product especially for baby boys .
1	my husband and i have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter , and to our dismay that includes four infant car seats including our brand-new duoglider snugride infant seat . we were planning on giving one to my mother-in-law , one to my sister-in-law , and keep the third for my husband 's car , but then we realized that more than likely , if we brought the baby over to their homes , chances are the baby would already be in his car seat . we were thrilled to find out that graco sells a snugride car seat base separately ! this way , we can bring our son to grandma 's and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another . the extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage , too . plus , the car seat base works with both the latch system and with a regular seat belt . a must-have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby
1	i thought i would quit breastfeeding because my nipples were soo sore ! i saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when i started to breastfeed . i placed the gelpads on , and within two hours , i could see the healing begin . i tried olive oil nipple cream , and did n't even want to try anything with lanolin because i read it was n't good to ingest , and it did not help at all . this is a great way to sooth nipples naturally . just let your breast air dry with a little of the breast milk ( natural oils ) , and then place the pads on the nipples . they are life savers . i think i only needed three pairs , until my nipples were used to the rigors of breast feeding ( about 2-3 weeks ) . do n't give up ! try these first , these work
0	i am a previous britax owner . i purchased the britax roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months . at 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it . since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the britax brand and purchase the marathon in the olivia print . i was very dissapointed . i had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving . when we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat . a huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes . it also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of . my daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout . the rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying . the constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap . that coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards . i went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns i bought the eddie bauer seat instead . so far i have no complaints . i would n't waste my money on this . buy the roundabout if you want britax name , but please dont bother with this marathon
1	some of the pieces were dent when i opened the box , it was too late to returned it back , i found out that wood was dented after i had trashed shipping box .
1	i brought this walker for my grandson and he loves it . he alway 's playing with the objects and is actually walking now . this wallker was easy to assemble also .
0	i read dr. karp 's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket . after doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one , i decided not to spend the $ 30+shipping on the miracle blanket , but get this instead . boy , was that a bad decision . we tried a few times , and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds ! granted , we had a big and healthy baby , who was strong , so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason , it might work nicely for a while , but otherwise , do n't waste your time with this . i ended up buying the miracle blanket , and that worked ! do yourself a favor , spend the extra $ 20 and buy the miracle blanket . i could have avoided many sleepless nights if i did that earlier
0	do not buy this mattress , it is not safe . this mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins . when i called kolcraft to inform them , the cs rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit , and that they have n't had any complaints . she also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size . we have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug . the kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily
1	i am very happy with this potty . it has a high guard which works well for a little boy .
1	when i purchased mine , there was no diaper dekor+ which is the larger size . however , i feel that we have no need for a larger one . my child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers ... no problem ! i bought the diaper genie because i was told so many things about it and i hate it , it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them . i am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the diaper dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes
1	i have taken and posted a picture to show what luke and i carry in this bag . we luckily have not had any ripping or stitching problems . we have a recieving blanket , cell phone , first aid kit ( in the ziplock at top of pic ) burts bees baby lotion , oil and diaper rash ointment , 3 diapers , bag of wipes , bib , onsie , sleeper , burp cloth , 2 toys , hat , and 3 empty ziplocks to hold dirty diapers , clothes that have ahd to be changed or trash . what is not in the picture is the camera that goes in the middle compartment because that took the picture . my cannon s2 powershot goes in the middle compartment ! we do n't have anything in the bottle container , but that is where we stuff dirty diaper and clothes ziplocks and there is nothing in the larger front pocket , so we have room to spare . excellent design and as other reviewrs have noted the colors are great in person . this is a great bag for day hikes and outings with dad . and it has held up great for us so far
0	i do not like these bags . the twist tie closure system is cumbersome . the bags are small . the plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen . the only advantage i can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly
1	the snuggle nest gave my husband and i peace of mind while co-sleeping with our son . i thought about purchasing the arm 's reach co-sleeper but my son wanted to be real close to us through the night . our son is ten weeks old and it still works . it is cumbersome when trying to nurse because you have to sit up and pull the baby out and after a cesarean that proved to be a little difficult . i 'm hoping the transition to his crib will be easy with the snuggle nest by putting the snuggle nest into his crib . the little light is helpful when trying to get my son to latch on during nursing or chaning diapers in the middle of the night ( the bedside light wakes my husband .
0	i agree with another reviewer , whose information i read only after i 'd purchased the clean shopper . it is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap . i returned this product as soon as i saw the strap , which you need to attach your child to the cart , is separate from the cover . this was not specified in the description . also , it just bothered me that the printed material ... the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child , not you , for heaven 's sake , are printed upside down to their eye . sorry , but i have enough to look at when i 'm grocery shopping . i am very disappointed that i still do not have a cart cover for my child . the clean shopper was at least reasonably priced . all of the other cart covers i 've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart , and are well designed , start at $ 60 .
0	i saw this at the store , and i just had to buy it . i loved all the little pockets for storing different things ; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place . the picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser , which can be used as a changing table . what a marvelous concept ! so , i took it out of the package , attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it . it looked very smart hanging there , and so practical ! when i came in the room the next day , it was on the floor in a crumpled lump . so , a little disheartened , but not wanting to give up , i hooked it up to my crib , instead . it was the next best thing and i really did like the device . i put all of my gear on there once more , the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture , but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it . so , not only can i not hook it up to my changing table , i also ca n't keep all of the changing gear on it . this essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed .
1	we looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we 've found . i love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down , it stores flat , and that you can add as many toys as you want . our baby has really enjoyed it . there is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time
0	we bought this when our baby was born ( 6 months ago , only used it a few times until recently ) . he loves it now to get him to sleep . the problem lies in that at 4 am , my husband and i awake to hear the mobile playing ... scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it . we go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals ... .the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off , causing the mobile to fall on the baby . ( he thought it was the funniest thing in the world , he was okay , thank god . ) but the little plastic hook piece was in his hand . if you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find . i thank god that he didnt put that in his mouth . it is a great soother for the baby , but be sure there are no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it has been great .
1	my husband and i adore this monitor . it picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great . we occasionally get some interference , but all i have to do is move the monitor and it goes away . the interference never occurs on the unit in my baby 's room , just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up . i love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house . i plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long ! you can defintely trust this monitor
0	i tried to put this oven `` lock '' on my oven . unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick . i finally fenagled it into place , sticking the first piece to the side of the oven , then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place . upon opening the oven door with very , very , very little force ( i just barely cracked the door open ) the latch teeth snapped open , as if the latch was n't even there . tried several times , even sort of holding the teeth , and no luck . in the trash it went . i also tried another lock also from safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge , but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle . so this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4 '' of the adhesive strip on the oven . pop - off it came when i tried to open the door . in the trash it went as well . i 'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens . :
1	it does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car . my wife used it on a cross-country trip we took and it basically saved our lives . well , not our lives , but it does work
1	we love it ! yes , the volume is low , but there 's a very simple solution to that -- put it near your head . the best things about this device are the ac adapter and the fact that it will run all night . i just leave it plugged in and turned on all the time ( our cat must think we live by the ocean now ! ) a couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds . if this happens to you , turn it over and flip the switch off of demo mode -- it has the 5-second setting so you can try it out in the store . we 're hooked on this thing now . i may have to buy another one someday when my son moves into his own room .
1	when i had my daughter i had no clue where to begin with breast pads so i bought several different types . a friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite . i wish i had never wasted money on the other pads . i did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands . it was worth it because they were so much more comfortable . i did n't have any chaffing like with most others . also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive .
1	this is a great light - shines stars all over the room . constellations are n't quite right , but they 're close . the different color options are great . for the price , it 's a great deal
0	we bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby . by her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom . she was hurt pretty bad . no way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight . please beware of how unsafe this product is . not at all what is advertised .
1	i think this product is fantastic , the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing . the timer is also a nice feature . this is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby . the sheep is cute and surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it 's tummy .
0	if you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you . but just try turning and especially sharp turns -- you 'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way .
1	i loved this ! he was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space . it folds up smaller than a pack and play , takes up very little room next to the bed , and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos ( or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby
0	i bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier . this bag was ok to start and fit my britax ( a feat in itself ) but 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it broke . i would not buy it . i emailed the company and have yet to hear back
0	i bought this product for my 3 month old for christmas and when i went to play with it , the remote did n't work . i did everything it said to do and it still did n't work . so , i took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty . when i took it out , the remote to it also did n't work . it says it has to be on `` play '' ( not try me or off ) and it has to do it 's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope . you should be able to control the volume , the song options , and be able to switch from colors to music but no . it just plain does n't work . i really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly , i will have to take it back but this time i 'll get my money back ... ... i do not suggest buying this product
0	we loved the monitor at first . the features are nice and the price was reasonable . then , without event or explanation , it died one day and we have n't been able to recharge one of the handheld units . maybe we got a dud
1	i was looking for a decent sized , sectioned plate for my 1 year old to have at the dinner table and these were perfect . i have not used them to travel with but i do not think the lids would stay on the plates very well in that type of setting . they do work great for her leftovers though when i put them in the fridge . they are nice and slim and fit well into long skinny areas .
1	ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional ? well , pretty much everyone i know , and they are all right of course . each baby is exceptional , in their own way . but how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians , nurses and early childhood educators ? well , i know one - mine ! i faithfully used the babyplus system when i was pregnant . one time when using it , he started knocking back . yeap , i actually felt him knock back at it , in rhythm . it only happened once , but i told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid . i was about 7 months pregnant then . well , lo and behold , after he was born people ( professionals ) do n't stop telling us how amazing he is . he is the most aware newborn you will ever meet . he is 2 months old now , and has been sleeping through the night ( 11 hours at a time ) since he was 2 weeks . he cries when he needs something , and never cries for no reason ( but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i do n't know how much that has to do with it. ) . yesterday he started reaching for objects . ca n't quite grab them yet , but it does n't stop him from trying . the pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is , how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age . he 's been holding his head up since the day he was born ( 3 days late ) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks . so , i do n't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it . i mean it could be just an accident but ... all i can say is that i will definitely use this product with our future children . i would pay thousands if i had to ( and we are not rich people ) because its worth every penny
1	the floppy seat is a great item ... no more worrying about baby 's hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs . i recommend this to all new moms and give it an a++
0	somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers : a nice zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller , a maclaren umbrella stroller , and in the middle this red peg perego aria stroller . we have had nothing but bad news with this aria stroller . what a clunker ! as an italian , i am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous . i am only being slightly facetious . this stroller is very sleek and stylish , and light-weight , but that is where it all ends . the biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels . pushing and steering is a constant battle . sometimes it just does n't want to go . i have really tried to inspect where the problem is , and it does not look like the wheels stick . rather , the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller . just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what i mean . other nits include the aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off , and the baby 's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable . but the biggest problem is the handling -- - it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore .
0	this item is misleading because it runs very small . i am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and i ordered the s/m size based on the waistline ... ..wrong ! i am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen . not only does it run small , but it also fold and wrinkles anytime i move so it is not much help . if you are shorter or petite , the waistband is very wide in the back and can be ill-fitting ( does not conform to the curve of your spine ) . it is definately made for taller , longer-torso women ( aka 6 ft. models ) . i would go with another type of support if given another chance
1	i was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews , but once i put the organizer up it was great . i use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items . the bottom is really good for several diapers . i love it ! ! !
1	this thing cracks us up ! we ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it . he can play with it , but its secure enough that he ca n't pull it off . it was also an absolute necessity for us - now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime , it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet . it puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time .
1	i have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used , thus far . i can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time . it seem quite rugged , and holds a ton ! i can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers , a travel wipes container , a small changing pad , a couple of spare onsies , a nursing shawl , 2 washcloths for spit up , an extra receiving blanket , a 4 oz bottle of cleanser , phone , lipstick , keys and wallet , and that is only in the main compartments . the only proplem i 've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before i had even used the bag , but i was able to fix it . i may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along , but for now , this is perfect
0	we bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter , who just love to make noise with anything . she also loves to stick things in her mouth because she 's teething . one day , she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth . the metal from one of the bells cut her lip ! we let her play with the other ones still , but the one with the bells is put away at least until she 's older
0	this pump is really slow , and absolutely kills your hand . for about the same price get the avent isis manual pump , it is waaaaaay faster and because of the massaging petals you get way more milk per pump , so it does n't hurt your hand . i have n't found that it hurts my hand at all , because you use it for way less time and have to pump far less often .
1	this is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids . this is a pretty boring product , but everything worked just fine .
1	my baby loves it . by the way it is bigger than it looks on picture . i was afraid that it would be too small for my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect .
0	i used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter , causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose . the first time it happened i thought i did n't screw the top on , but then it happened again . after doing some research , this is a common problem with these bottles .
0	rather than this sling ... i recommend you check out [ ... ] for your sling . they are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors . this is a far better buy than the native baby carrier
0	we got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels . i was not going to pay $ 200 for a car seat/stroller combo , so we picked 2 alternatives . i was hoping that the traveling toddler would be great , but i found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase . to add the weight of my car seat ( a britax ) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase . it felt awkward and unstable . the physics of it just did not work . so , we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us . the bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left . there was no more window seats available on one of our flights , so we gate checked the seat and i was happy to know that it was protected
1	very cozy -- great for wrapping up after bath to get warm . but honestly , it 's usually in the laundry . and since swaddling lasts for a short period of time , it 's use is pretty limited . however , when it is clean , i like having it around .
0	got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it is n't all that easy to get on and off . with 8 snap on straps , it 's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis . i realized changing the crib sheet was just easier . with crib mattresses being vinyl covered , why do we need waterproof sheets anyway . i just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple . sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products . by the way , two of the straps broke off in the wash , thank god it was after i realized i did n't need this anyway
1	i really love this system and find it has met all my needs . my son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it so easy to express , store , and feed him with a bottle . i have not found the liner cost to be a problem . nor was i disturbed by how many kits i needed to buy . i think i bought 5 or 6 to make sure i had enough . it just depends on how much you 're going to need to store . but you do n't need many actual bottles , since the milk does n't have to be stored in them , so the price evened out for me . besides , it 's much cheaper than buying formula ! i also do n't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats . i can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look . but when he 's at the breast , i do n't know how much he 's eaten , so i do n't track just how much he has from the bottle , either . i just make sure he has enough dirty diapers . i find the system easy to use because i can express directly into a liner , put the bottle into the freezer , then remove the liner from the bottle when it 's frozen . this reduces the space needed . when it 's feeding time , just pop one of them into a bottle , heat , and replace the cap with a nipple . easy !
0	rent a hospital grade medalia pump . you wont be sorr
1	i received this gerber gift set for my baby shower . the products lather up really well and they smell great ! they are gentle and they do n't make my daughter get a rash . you get a lot of product for the price too . my daughter really relaxes with the lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the menthol wash when she had a cold . now that my daughter is teething , she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin . the moisturizing stick works great for this . we love this gift set and would recommend it .
1	i purchased the extention kit for the superyard xt play gate to go with the play gate that i purchased . it works great for my new pomeranian puppies . the play yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe . it will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves . the fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so i can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be . i love this item and i am very happy i purchased it . i feel the gate is great for animals , i have not used it with children as of this time
0	i was looking forward to getting this toy for my son . but when i opened it up i was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag . i thought the picture showed several more tools . maybe my tool kit was not complete . either way my son never really showed much interest in it
1	the superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion . our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it . you can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained .
0	we ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly . our children are 2.5 and 10 months . our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support . also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield , and peek a boo window cracking , also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric . the kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when my two kids were in it . it cloapsed because the locking system melted ... .. oops , i guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test ! !
1	the fastest way to know your plastic baby wares are clean ! i love these bags . note , i use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster , since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping . you do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item before steaming it for best results . overall , i would highly recommend this product , it has been a lifesaver to me
0	this was a good product for a few weeks and kept my babe warm . but ... the zipper does not work well and it broke already . i tried to repair it , but after that broke , the quilting came apart and was too much trouble to fix . i would not recommend this jj cole product as i had the same problem with another one we inherited
1	i love my new stroller . i also have a graco travel system . the graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle . i think the peg steers very well , unlike what some other reviewers have said . i even set up an obtacle course in the store i bought it at to make sure that i could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it . it handled like a dream . my husband and i went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator , instead of waiting in the long line , my husband carried our 1yr old , and i carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened . it was a breeze ! we did the same thing when we left the mall , only this time i collasped the stroller , the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs . it 's still winter , so i have n't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade , but hopefully that will work out ok . i would reccomend this stroller to anyone , infact i 've told two of my girlfriends about it , and they have already added it to their gift registry . you will be happy with this stroller
1	i bought this same crib in may of 2005 from buy buy baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble i did it while i was pregnant . it had no scartches or chips . i like it a lot and my daughter loves it . we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2 . but its very roomy . it can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much . i really like it cuz the quality is superb and we 're very very happy with . in fact we bought another one from amazon , for my son . my kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1 . he likes it a lot too . but even though company and everything is the same . the crib did come with some damaging to it , but it wasnt that bad , you dont really notice it , we got lucky i guess . but i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off . the quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one i bought . i dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues . but overall its a nice crib i just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one . but its definately worth the buy . and it came with super fast shipping with amazon . and the shipping was free too . but its well worth the buy ! ! ! ! ! ! my kids are happy and so im happy ! !
0	i bought this potty because i thought it was soooo cute , looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything ! i still think it 's cute , but just like many other reviewers say , all the music and talking and sounds are way too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training . and , like other reviewers say , the sensor is not accurate , so it 's always saying the child went potty when they did n't . very confusing for a child who 's trying to learn to really `` go '' in the potty . we 're currently potty training our daughter , and we have three training potties -- this one , an older one that has a soft seat , and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it 's `` potty time . '' when we first got it she had a blast with it , using it as a toy and nothing more . now that the newness has worn off , she shows very little interest in it . if i had it to do over , i would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds . here 's a suggestion : do n't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training . then , as a reward for his/her accomplishment , put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do . with the training part out of the way , the sounds wo n't be such a distraction anymore
0	i ca n't get it to stick ! i might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold , but as soon as i put toys in it , it falls
0	just as the other mothers have stated , nothing about this pump is beneficial . it was given to me by a lactation nurse , but it was more trouble than it was worth . only once was i able to pump more than one ounce ( it took almost an hour ) , and i hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing . i only needed it occassionally , but this was such a waste of time i bought the pump in style , which is amazing . this is not comparable to the more expensive medela pumps , so if you want something that works with little discomfort , invenst in the pump in style or similar model . do n't waste your money , even if it is cheap
0	i wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy . i will say our child is a bright , out-going 8 month old now , but in the beginning she was colicky and a terrible napper ! i thought this was a brilliant idea , but began to realize that many of the bright , gifted children i know did n't have exposure to this system . it is loud to wear and not so comfortable . you are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening . good luck if you choose to purchase , but just think , einstein was fine with out one
1	our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat . we love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding . i was looking forward to the reclining feature as well , but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature
1	i have had the harmony for seven months and use it about 2-3 times a day . it it still working great with all the original parts . i have not had to buy replacement anything . i do admit i recently tried another pump . it was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby . with in two days i called the company , i got a refund and am back to my harmony . this is a great pump and i am so happy that we bought it . stop searching and buy this pump
1	my son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital . being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets . he began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old . i think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security . he was never able to sleep without being in it . he is now 30 months old and still wo n't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack . we had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it . that is how much he loves his sleep sack . it is by far the best thing i ever bought for my son
1	i really like this . i have had some water leakage on the counter but not enough to really make a mess . i think sometimes the excess water is going to get through the cracks no matter what . my bottles fit just fine , i use the avent bottles .
1	love it , and it is a must in our babies room , but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer ( lion heart 2004 model ) does not fit correctly . to fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer . i love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course . note : we do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great , especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers ! also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery 's them
1	i bought this thinking it was a gimic . worse case was my daughter would get a night light on her bed . turns out this actually works . her bedroom is filled with stars . she uses it every night and i use it to check on her . it is still using the original batteries , 30+ days . the amber color does not work so good but her walls are pink . on white it might work better . get it for something diffrent that works
0	i was given this as a gift , so thankfully i did n't waste my money on it . this sterilizer is so messy and awkward , that i can not recommend it at all . the metal pan started corroding after only a week . little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop . all the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty , so i ca n't imagine how it could possibly clean . horrible product
0	i purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed . we have the full sized papasan swing and the travel ocean wonders swings at home ( which in retrospect , we were wishing we brought with us ) . while neither of those are 100 % perfect , they are much better than this one . the open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame , stop the swing from moving , and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars . also , the swing seat almost lays horizontal ( with the foot part of the swing much higher than the head position ) while swinging , to the point that i am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit , she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor . lastly , the mobile is horrible . it 's pitiful and i find it hard to believe that fisher price put something like that on the market . it 's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings . the strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches . these toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds . it 's a very poor design and needs a lot of work . and my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it does n't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have . that said , the swing is very attractive and appealing . i only wish it were better made and more thought out .
1	we were very pleased with how easy this was to install , despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters . ours is actually a half wall and half banister , but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge . the directions were n't great , but it was fairly self explanatory . we feel much more comfortable letting our one-year old play upstairs in the loft now
0	this product just does n't have much variety . my baby 's both are completely bored in it , and have only used it a handful of times . they are 5 months and 1 year . she like noise makers and squishy toys , but these are all hard , boring toys ... at least to my kids
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer ... for an alternative way to hook to crib . they were less than helpful . i am thinking about returning the entire set i 'm so disappointed
1	this is the bmw of all highchairs . it 's super-sturdy and the italian leather seat is easy to care for . ignore the reviews about being a `` pain to clean . '' you need to clean every highchair- nooks , crannies , and all .
1	i love it ! this is probably one of my most used baby items . it is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean . i 've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends
1	my son is just so excited about his sponge bob bed . he climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it . i like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself
1	i can not say enough positive things about this item ! i absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night . this item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids .
0	the idea for this product is great . the problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles . the buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex . this caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place . they instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage . if another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect
0	i was so anxious to get this and when i finally did , my daughter was just not that interested with it . she barely plays with it . i was hoping that with this she would spend more time on her tummy because she normally hates that . maybe that 's why she did n't care much for this .
0	when i saw this tub , i thought wow this is great . it had everything . well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower i decided to try it before the baby came . i am so glad that i did . the pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak . the shower was very difficult to operate , i had to press really hard . the only thing that i loved about the tub was the sling . it is very nice . i think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better ... in the beginning speed is key , the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub . in my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else .
1	great product - i heard from other mommies that this was the pump to get ; i agree
1	this is one of the best on the market . looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books . a `` must buy ''
0	the idea of the stroller is great . however after purchasing and using it , it is n't well equipped . there is no cup holders , the basket for storage is not easy to get to and is n't even big enough to hold a diaper bag , let alone any bags when shopping . i also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk . need less to say i do n't even use it much b/c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids . i wasted my money on this . graco has a new one out that looks so much better and much for equipped for on the go moms like me . wish i would have waited . it is the same price . wish i could have exchanged it .
1	i found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two-year old easier . she loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked . the security agent said he wished all parents used this instead of trying to jam enormous strollers through the x-ray machine .
1	it is still waiting for the baby to arrive , so i have n't used it yet ... . but i do love the utility and design of it
1	this pillow is the best ! after sleeping with it the first night , i new i could n't be without it . my husband bought it for me and i am so thankful . i left it at my mother 's house one night and i could not sleep , i keep waking up . the night after getting it back i slept like a baby again . if you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this ! its very soft , and you can take the cover off to wash it
0	the swing was easy to install and i did not need extra tools or help . unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal . it was even enough , however , and i put my daughter in . the swing was tilting a little far forward but i could not adjust it . the worst part was getting her out . the tray was near impossible to undo from its locked position . i guess i did not need to worry about her falling out , i was just wondering if i would be able to get her out at all . i 'll be donating the swing
1	i will say up front that i use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests . the gate is built well ... simple and functional . it has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily . it went up easy and works as designed . it is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue . in a similar vien , you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close . my guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended . overall i would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs
0	when we first received this stroller , we loved it ! it handled well -- very smooth , easy turns , could be directed with one hand . my one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs . but as we started using it more and more , we found it was not very `` user-friendly . '' for one , the way it opened was not intuitive . we had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar . forget trying to do this while holding a baby . also , the canopy was too small and does n't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system . as a result , to keep the sun off baby , we needed an extra blanket . these were minor inconveniences , but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo . we quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were . they simply slid into a clip on the back support , so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps . he was still held in the harness , but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels . too , after about a year and a half of daily use , the handling deteriorated . the wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and i constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned .
0	this gate is absolutely worthless . if i could give it zero stars , i would . it was difficult to install and is very flimsy . i have it at the top of the stairs and i do n't trust that it will hold at all . i hate that i spent so much on the gate and now i have to purchase another one .
1	i love the plug-in feature , there 's been many times i 've left the swing on ( have to rush to change a diaper and left it on ) . true , it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls . the swing is n't incredibly fast , but for my 2 month old , it 's worked well . there are two volume levels for the music , but i 've only used the lowest setting .
0	the `` breathe safe padded sheet '' also left a mesh imprint on my baby 's face . placing a sheet over the breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine : 1 ) untying bumper guard moving it out of the way 2 ) struggling to `` pull '' out heavy mattress from crib 3 ) removing washing sheet mattress pad 4 ) wiping off mattress with soap water 5 ) replacing sheet mattress pad 6 ) returning heavy mattress to crib 7 ) re-arranging dust ruffle 8 ) re-tying bumper guard other than that , it seemed like a good idea . searching for a better product .
0	i tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me . they were hot and of course they also showed right through any top i was wearing . i had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention
1	my baby and i just love it ! ! ! ! it is so easy to bath her now and so much fun ! i started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome . she plays with her toys and has tons of fun . the side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax . after her bath , i just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day . i really recommend it , it is super practical . ( please never leave your baby unattended
0	after trying almost every bottle , i tried these and waht a nightmare ! there are to many parts to clean and they leak ! i called dr. brown 's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it . as most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula . i saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them . i went with the playtex natural disposables and never looked back
1	finally found this item ! i could n't find this anywhere locally . it is easy for the kids to use and it is easy to clean
0	nine days from mn to pa seems too long ; perhaps target direct got process problems . i am not satisified ... got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for $ 1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it
0	i recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back . they say they 're fitted but they are n't elastic so they 're not that well fitted . they are paper thin . apparently graco has n't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality ! i purchased the koala portable sheets which were cheaper , thicker , and truly are fitted with elastic ! do n't waste your money on these
0	i bought this thinking it would be great , but have been very disappointed . the suction cups do n't stick very well ( especially on wood ) even if you wet them first . my daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor
0	i have used the avent isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump . i was wrong . problems encountered include , it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak , expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding , measurements are hard to read , they do not hold a full 8 ozs , due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily , and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as i forgot to pack it more than once ! save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing .
1	i was worried this looked cheap , and too sterile and hospital-like for my new baby , but it is much more attractive in person . safetly 1st needs to have a new photo taken of this crib , theirs looks dated . it arrived and took less than five minutes to assemble , by myself at 8 months pregnant ! completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position . click- done ! has two adjustable height settings , and comes with a nice mattress . i would not order another one . this is very soft and suitable . this rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly . the eddie bauer sheets from target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft , love it ! my crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and i love the way it turned out . in fact i ca n't believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives , since i would say it is nicer than the wooden mini-cribs i saw in person at a local store . i have a 24 month old and i did not want two cribs , but i also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed . we bought one , but she does n't want to stay in it at night . she feels safe and sleeps well in her crib . this crib is stable and will be fine for our second child until the older baby is out of her crib . this is a great product and very reasonable too !
1	this is so much better than any potty chair , and it is never in the way ! very easy to put on and my daughter loves it ! she ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also ! !
1	this is such a great idea . i just leave mine in my diaper bag so if we end up somewhere without a clean bib , we can make our own .
0	these do n't fit my cabinets because the width between knobs is too large . i 'm not sure how , but if possible , verify the width on your cabinets against what these offer
0	i have three baby carriers . it seems eccessive but i never found one that really was doing it for me . i started with gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime i had to put the baby inside . my son was crying while i was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he was n't looking too confortable . when he got older ( 5 mounths ) we bought a backpack carrier . this is a really really a nice buy . we loved it and so did our son . the problem with it is that i would n't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside . so when my other son was born we tried this new carrier . i think that 's the best for newborns because they do n't have to support any body part . more over , when the baby sleeps , he is in a nice position and they seem to like it ( even though i though his head was in a weird angle ? ! ? ! ) as soon as the baby gets heavier ( 8 or 9 lbs ) it 's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have i large breast as i do . it slips from its place so the head of the child does n't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest ( so when you have a large breast the baby 's head is really really in a weird angle ! ) . i think that it does n't worth the price for the time you use it . now that my younger son is 5 mounths , i do n't use it anymore
1	as very frequent ( often long-distance ) travelers , we routinely purchase airline tickets for our daughter so that she can travel safely and comfortably in her car seat on plane trips . we really pushed the size limits of the car seat that integrated into a stroller ( the graco travel system ) for ease of use , but once she had finally made the dreaded transition into a larger seat , we tried practically every method for moving the seat , toddler , diaper bag , collapsible stroller , carry-on , etc. , from our home to and through the airport without ending up completely exhausted and frustrated . of all of the options that we tried , the pac back was the most consistently comfortable and convenient . i 'm not very tall ( 5'5 '' ) , and find that i can manage to wear the pac back , stow loose and light objects ( such as coats or stuffed animals ) in the car seat itself , sling a diaper bag over one shoulder and a purse on the other , and still have enough mobility/agility to bend down and pick my daughter up or hold her hand . ( granted , i look like a pac animal , but that 's a small price to pay for having free hands at key moments . ) the strap system is intuitive to use and seems well-constructed . compared to a car seat bag , the pac back is much more easily removed from the car seat once on the plane , and i have never had any trouble replacing the straps in a minute or two -- plenty of time to have the seat on my back by the time people start exiting the plane . the straps adjust easily enough that my taller husband and i can take turns carrying the seat when we travel together without spending a lot of time situating ourselves . the only drawbacks : you really have to pay attention while wearing what amounts to a giant rigid backpack that you do n't bash someone or something while turning , and the straps may have to be removed to go through security if the x-ray machine has an extremely small opening ( only happened once or twice at regional airports ) . overall , an amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product .
1	i received this pack n ' play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up . it is very colorful and the the toys are cute . it was very easy to set-up . i am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total . the matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead . it is very multi-functional
1	once my daughter grew out of her carters sleeved sleepsacks i was glad i bought these halo sleepsacks . they are made from awesome fabrics and i like that the zipper ends at their feet ( for easy diaper changes ) . i highly recommend these to any new mom ( or experienced mom ) . it left me assured that my daughter did n't wake up in the morning with a blanket over her head . she is a active baby in her crib . :
0	i ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail . 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements . they said it would take 2 to 3 weeks . its been 3 weeks , when i called again they said it would take another 2 weeks . how hard is it to get replacements ? ? my baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces . would like to get the nursery done , preferrably before my child goes to college . we purposely ordered it early to give us time , but apparently that wasnt enough . i tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it .
0	this pump was refered to me by the hospital where i had my first son . so since i got it and used it . my breast hurt worse using this pump then when i was engorged . it was one of the worst experiances . i was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby . i connot recommend enough to not use this one . i am know expecting again and looking for a pump . i know that i will not go by hospital recommendation again
1	these blocks contain everything you could want in a toy . each has different textures , images , and something unique about it . -the yellow block has a duck on the one side that `` quacks '' when pressed . on the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror . another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif . -the red block rattles , has a picture of a robin ( ? ) on the one side , a square pattern motif on another side , and a picture of strawberries on another . -the green block has a frog with 3d legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake . it also has a picture of a green apple ( mine does , at least , although this picture shows a leaf ) , a silky fabric with leaf prints , and a triangle motif . -the blue block is another rattle . it has a picture of the be turtle on one side , some jeans made from real denim on another , and a star motif on another . -all blocks have a side with the color 's name ( i bought mine at target , and they have the name in english , spanish , and french although these pictured only show it in english ) . the rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft , fluffly fur or a bumpy texture ( like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding ) . my three month old loves to look at these blocks and i rub the different sides against her skin while saying `` soft '' , `` smooth '' , or `` bumpy '' and she loves the feelings . my friend 's daughter , who is five months , loves to pick up and throw down the blocks . it 's one of her favorite games . i 'd reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant
1	we have n't used this set yet because our baby is due in june , but have set it up in our crib . the fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking . the bumper fits well in our crib , and the tags say all the fabrics are 100 % cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100 % polyester . we are very happy with this set for our future little girl
1	love it , love it , love it ! no more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty , lint covered binkies . it could be a little bigger , for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it 's a great idea
0	our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed ( and i 'm an industrial designer dad , so i should know ! ) . it can hit the door frame easily , the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height . he 's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it . he has fun in it at first , but it always seem a disappointment in the end . save your time and money and get the baby einstein excersaucer . that is agreat toy and better for development skills
0	the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item . and were unable to fix the problem
0	i bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet . we have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar . it is not ! it has not fit on any public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place . she does n't want to use it , which leaves me with nothing ! i would not purchase this product
1	we bought two different kinds of gates for our living room area . we bought the kidco configure gate and the kidco elongate . the elongate was to cover an area of 84 '' . the elongate can only go straight across and opening . it 's extension are screwed together and have an overlap . so the gate is not actually straight across . we are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two configure gates . took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall . took us over an hour . the configure gate is on the pricey side . we almost did not buy it . but it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need . we use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs . it was so easy to add the extension piece on . you just snap out the pole and add the extension piece . you can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening . to mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on . it was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes . it was very sturdy . i highly recommend this gate .
0	we ordered a tub from baby because which was delivered . then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered . on route the formula fell off a ups truck and was lying in the street for over a day . a neighbor saw it and gave it to us . baby because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it . we expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day . they said it was n't our concern and to just give it back
0	we started out really liking this seat . its colors are not horrid like most of the others , and it does n't cry `` i have a baby ! ! '' . it just looks nice and stylish . also , our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat . however , the # 1 problem of this seat is its straps/belts . first , you clip them together at the baby 's midsection ( easy ) . then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom , so you can clip them ( as one ) into the female end of the lap belt clip . this is easier said than done , as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them ( as one ) into the other part of the belt clip . it 's hard to explain properly , but really , it 's not easy to do , especially if you have only one hand free . second , the belts get twisted . the 2 pieces at the base of the belt , which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip , they get reversed because the belt twists . think of taking your seat belt in your car , and somehow twisting the belt itself , so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way . if this has ever happened to you , you know what i mean , and it 's a pain to fix . just like with this seat . it seems to get screwed up effortlessly , but then to fix it takes several minutes . forget this thing ! ! we bit the bullet and exchanged it for a peg perego , after we used a friend 's when we went to visit them for a long weekend , and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did . the final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14-pound son was basically already too big for it ... yet the peg perego had plenty of growing room . yes , it cost us about $ 100 more , but it 's well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it 's time for the standard ( non-infant ) car seat
1	we received a graco travel system from our registry , and got some good use out of it . however , we are in a big city , and the stroller just could n't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads . not to mention it was so rickety i 'm positive we could be heard a mile away . i broke down and ordered the jeep liberty limited urban terrain jogger , and i love it . 1 . it was simple to assemble . 2 . it is easier on my hands and wrists to steer . 3 . the air-filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter . 4 . the toy steering wheel ? she freaks out over it , in a good way . she *beeped* her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store . since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves , i am ultra pleased . 5 . the price is wonderful . we do n't use the music on the move feature , so i ca n't really comment on it . i fill the tires right before we leave the house every time , and it 's not hard to do , so i have no complaints there . it is a bulky item , so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky . however , the pros all outweigh the cons for me . i am extremely pleased with it
1	out of all the department stores here , i got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph , for the easness . it got noted as lighter and easier to deal with . i secound the so far so good comment earlier.. its comfortable than most seats i have shopped for besides the # 1 britax that i have yet to experience : )
0	leaking , slipping , ca n't use over the kitchen sink . horrible design .
0	i received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter . i thought it was a wonderful toy , and so did my daughter . after playing a while with it on the floor , my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands , and fell down , and the toy dropped on the floor . at this point the toy started to malfunction . the music would play sometimes and not others . and after being dropped to the floor a couple more times , it stopped working altogether . i think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be . great toy ... but it did n't last long
0	i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it . i find it a nightmare ! if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out . it does not work when on the charger . it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts . what a piece of junk . i would in no way recommend this product to anyone
0	that would be one of my problems with this pump . it hurt , it took forever , i did not have a good expereince with this pump .
0	well lets see i ordered this product for my sons birthday ... which by the way was on the 14th of january . well i think its the 2nd of feb. still had n't received it , but i did get a chair.. ? ? ? anyway so i called and canceled when i got the chair , the money was never placed back into my account , i was told it would be put in on a monday so tuesday i felt safe writing a check that would include that money ... and my bank went overdrawn for like 200 dollars..in fees ( i realize it was my fault for believing a reputable company like amazon ! ) . now its been a month and i call youall back and you say that it should be sent out to me this week , though this is the only email i get from you ... .how should i rate the damn table when i havent recieved it ... .i mean put yourself in my situaition ... how would you rate it
1	i thought these were very good quality considering the price . i like them better than the one i bought at bru that cost much more
1	i ca n't find on this website the exact tub i bought for my daughter , but this tub looks most like it . i tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub , but that did n't work at all . the small inflatable tub is definately the way to go . my daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all . it is a pain to blow the tub up , but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook , so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall . my daughter is nearly 1 year old now , and has been using this tub for about 5 months . there is still plenty of room for her to grow and i think she 'll be using this tub for awhile . i feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub
1	when my daughter was born , i did n't know about swaddling , and it would take me hours to get her to sleep ! i would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep , then put her in her crib ... and she 'd flail her arms , wake up and cry , and i had to start all over ! what a nightmare ! then i figured out that since her arms wake her , it would make sense to wrap her in something so she could n't move them as much ... so i started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier to get her to sleep . but then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again . when she was a little over a month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets on the internet and immediately bought it . it worked like a charm ! it was so easy to wrap my daughter in it , and it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would 've saved me from so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son was born , and thankfully i already knew about those blankets from the start . he goes to sleep great in the swaddleme blanket ! out of curiosity , i tried to put him to sleep without this blanket , and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter ! i consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy . it should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep
1	even though this costs a bit more , its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !
0	1 ) like others here , my charges do not last more than 5 hours . the beeping from the parent unit will wake you at about 3am every night ( unless you leave them on the charger ) . 2 ) both of my parent units now ( after only two weeks of minor useage ) refuse to connect with the nursery unit , beeping endlessly . `` cycling '' them on and off per the prescribed ( though not well detailed ) manufacturer 's trouble-shooting method has done nothing . only logical conclusion : the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal . also : while they were working i did not really get the hype these units generated . my home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story `` box '' type arrangement . the static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and ( maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go ) , the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen . so we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery . poorly designed ( operator interface , controls , directions and trouble-shooting ) , poorly engineered ( poor reception , enormous static , fast battery drain ) and poorly manufactured ( apparent faulty parts and lack of quality ) product
1	i was using the diaper genie and i was n't at all impressed . i was at a shop needing to pick up genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $ 14 . i bought it . from day one i loved it i threw out the genie and i wo n't go back . it only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often . they are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent . also i feel the pail could be taller , when i change the kitchen bag ( which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers ) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full . but other than that its a great investment , no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy
0	besides the fact that the straps where n't long enough to hold on to my son crib , it ended up on the floor every other day ! ! ! save your money and do n't buy it ! ! !
1	the booster works great , does not slip on a chair , and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own . i highly recommend this product
1	i love this item . it was a life saver . at around 4-6 weeks , my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding . since it 's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a `` no , no '' for sids , i was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent sids . i had tried swaddling my baby in blankets , but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it . i also did n't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face , another `` no , no '' for sids . so i bought these swaddle me blankets that fasten easily with velcro . and shortly after we started using the swaddle me 's , he started sleeping through the night , occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding ( which i keep him swaddled for ) and then he falls right back to sleep and i carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night . he 's 4 months old now and we 're still using them ... . buy a few , because if we wets himself , which boys do a lot , you 'll need another one to switch him into
1	the pisa is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula , so my pump has already paid for itself ( used for 6 months and still going strong ) ! i 've tried generic immitations and they just do n't compare . invest your money in the real thing , it 's worth it
0	i registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn . i thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse . well , the first time i used this it took more time to set it up than i did using it . also , the button on the shower head is hard to press , and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom ( found that out the hard way ) . when you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick . my daughter does love the spa effect , but i think she prefers warm water throughout her bath . the one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it . i have washed and dried it many times and can not get this smell out . needless to say i had to purchase another insert for the tub , which does n't fit very well , so im a bit irritated . overall this is a good idea , it needs some kinks worked out of it ... .just not worth $ 40 . so now im off to target to purchase a new tub : -
1	this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity , 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns , until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june , now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ? the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall
1	my daughter was flying to virginia beach virginia to see her husband off to kuwait where he is serving our country . she flew alone with two toddlers-one still in diapers . i had bought her a jeep brand double umbrella stroller . i purchased this to free her hands up and help her navigate the airport alone . now that she is home she has raved repeatedly how super helpful this item was . it was thee most helpful item i purchased for he
0	these bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom . the fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff . i lost three bags of milk due to leaks . if you have to transport the bags anywhere , like back and forth to work like i do , i would avoid these bags . they just leaked all over the place for me , even after i carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions . i would recommend the lanisoh bags over these .
1	these are the best bibs . i have tried many . they do not peel , crack , etc . i have used the same set of bibs for 2 years . i just bought a set for my sister . worth the money
0	hi i bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension . i was so wrong ! if your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure . there are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either . i ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub . but i have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it . it has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play . so if you are searching for a bath seat i dont recommend the safety 1st at all
1	we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on . he would n't use that potty , but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it . the bjorn is shaped perfectly , with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee . it 's so comfy that he will sit and read a book ! looks great too . simple and easy to clean
0	i started my newborn out using the avent bottles . after a few weeks , she began crying alot . you could hear the gas moving in her tummy , and every time her tummy would grumble , she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain . she would also pass gas constantly . it was so difficult to feed her because she would cough , spit and cry the whole time . then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards . i tried switching formulas - did n't work . tried mylicon , zantac , gripe water , bicycling her legs , etc . etc . etc ... nothing worked . the pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do , that she would outgrow it . finally , we decided to switch bottles ( i switched to playtex nursers . ) instantly we noticed a difference ! she was extremely quiet during feedings , did n't squirm or cry ! she began ingesting almost twice as much formula per feeding ( probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the avent bottles ! ) and would go longer between feeds . and when she swallowed , it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air ! something about those avent bottles made her swallow tons of air . i think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate . with the playtex nursers , the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats , eliminating any air bubbles . she is a completely different baby now . she is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying . so if you decide to buy these bottles - beware . if you are already using them and your baby has colic , switch immediately ! do n't just assume that colic is `` normal '' or will be `` outgrown . '' babies do n't deserve to suffer this way ! ! !
0	i bought this about a year ago based on great reviews . i 'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later . problems : the uneven weight difference causes the aria to pull the small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete ( forget the grass at the park ) the trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios the fabric storage area underneath is held up with six `` buttonholes '' that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag the straps are really tricky to figure out and i 've never been able to get them right the shades are very small and next to worthless the drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller for the money i spent i wish i 'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel . it 's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child , but how herculean you become once you have two . also , the whole one-handed open-close feature that i craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it 's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway . if i could , i 'd sell this one and get a jogger ( i need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground ) but i do n't think i could sell this one for more than $ 20 in clear conscience . a shame
0	loved our marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward , loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat . since this happened he 's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place ... just by loosening the harness.although a highly rated seat i would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product . i have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this . not very happy
1	i received this set at a baby shower back in 2005 . it has held up really well . my only advice : with a retail price of $ 232.00 and even an amazon price of $ 152 , it 's still too steep . i never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping , so i hardly ever `` made '' the bed . next time around , i 'm going to find a pattern i like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it , then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet . the room itself is what you and everyone else sees . the bedding is almost impossible to see , unless you 're hovering over the crib . i do especially love the lamp , switchplate , mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection . you could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone .
1	my grand daughter is so proud of her big girl potty seat . i would have given it a rating of 5 but she said the rim hurts her
0	they are messy when they opened . i get milk on my hands and they cost way too much . i do n't have much room in my freezer . when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate ... it 's like $ 17 for ten : -
1	i own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ( ( this one , the duoglider , two small single strollers , and a double umbrella stroller ) ) and i absolutely love this one ! first of all , if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is , which is for jogging , or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain . my husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ( ( and has no complaints ) ) , but i on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors . the wheels go over almost any surface , including gravel , dirt , grass , concrete , brick , sand , boardwalk anything , i love it . the seats both fully recline ( ( individually ) ) and when they do , the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ( ( although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look ) ) . the five-point harness on a jogger is a must have , and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well . the basket is huge and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block , which is very important to me . it is also removable , but i do n't see why it would be advantageous to take it off . plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well , handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks . considering the type of stroller it is , it folds very easily , and i can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ( ( which is equally as easy to do , rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism ) ) . the canopy is enormous and proves for great sun protection when needed ! the breaks are fantastic , and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging , and need to stop quickly , according to my husband anyway . the included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ( ( can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy , incase there is a chance of rain you do n't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet ) ) , but i do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs . i do dislike the fact that it is extremely difficult to turn ( ( although i have kind of gotten it down to a science , you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit , the turn is very wide and not that smooth ) ) . i think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ( ( a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller ) ) , but that 's just me personally . the baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way , and i have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ( ( that 's why i have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches , so i do n't have to constantly go into the basket ) ) . the canopy is quite large , and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it does n't go back neatly , and if its a windy day the canopy does n't always stay up . if you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use , and do n't mind the large size or getting used to turning , then i highly recommend the tike tech
1	i am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that i 've actually done it . i must admit i was very apprehensive before i actually used them because i thought it would be so much work , but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day ... not hard . these diaper covers are fantastic . i have not had a single leak with them . when my daughter was first born , a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks , and we had numerous leaks . we actually used the newborn size of super whisper wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now . she was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born . i use the chinese prefold diapers with them . i tried two different types of the gerber prefold , but they 're just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated . what sold me on these covers is how i can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and i do n't have to hand wash them or anything
0	we first had the original diaper champ , which i would have given 4 stars . it kept the odor in pretty well , was easy to use , used regular trash bags ... etc . we really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid . since it was letting the odor out , we decided to replace it with the new and improved model . worst diaper pail ever . as soon as the diapers start piling up , the lid grabs tabs , wipes , etc and jams the top so you ca n't flip it . i spent so much time shaking , wiggling and kicking the thing i was very quickly exasperated . when you flip the top , it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model . this is why things get jammed ... also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it . horrible
0	do n't bother with these . they are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary . it is much easier to buy storage bags . if you are pumping full time , you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time . i also found that i did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby 's belly and the result is gas or worse , colic . they also flow too fast for newborns
0	i usually love the first years products . i already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it . i wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so i thought i 'd try this one . i was expecting to love the swing feature , it was the one thing i thought was missing out on the fisher price one . well , i returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one . here are the reasons why ; the base of the chair is hollow and wobbly , it is also very wide and did n't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair . you have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide . at their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure . thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out , and then you wipe baby 's hands , as you 're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off , he 's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray . the back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down . you have to take the chair apart to adjust the level . and when folded up , it 's not as compact and portable as fisher price 's model . do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $ 5 for the healthy care booster seat .
1	i bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and i heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic . i thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing . no colic this time , but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top . she follows them around with her eyes . very stimulating for the young ones
0	i have to say that i just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail , ( i ordered online because i 'm so far from a babies r us location ) and i was excited at first . the color is great , and the cover fit perfectly , but i have n't washed it yet . actually i have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric . the fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area ( middle of long side ) . i plan to exchange this cover for another of the same , i hope for better luck with the next one , but man , the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating
1	i was debating between this analog model and digital models . i have never heard the digital models to be honest . but this analog model has been great . i can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to `` buy time '' when i am busy and ca n't get to her immediately . i have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about . if your family is on a tight budget like mine , this is in the best bang for the buck out there today
1	this is a great organizer . i read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until i received this one . it is great ! we use the avent bottles and they , and all of their parts , fit very well . there are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers . it did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter , but once we mastered that , all is well
1	i am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best pack-n-play on the market . when # 3 came along we needed to purchase a new pack-n-play . the graco pack n play with bug toys is absolutely the best we 've ever owned . the bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old . she has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months , but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings . she actually gets excited about playing in her pack n play ... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption ! and , best of all , it is so much bigger than the other pack n plays . there is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys . the set up and take down is super easy ... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle . i am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the pack n play . i never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up . overall , i ca n't say enough wonderful things about this product ! i 'd put it on the new parent 's `` must have '' list for sure
1	my wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old . we feed our daughter with bottles ( mix formula with breast milk ) , and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref ( my wife did breast bumping ) , and mix with formula , we use this warmer all the time . also , when we travel out , this one is quite useful . generally with only a little small amount of water , the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby . also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag ( well , not compact bag though )
1	i was able to put this dresser together by myself and i was 6 months pregnant . the overall look is beautiful . a great buy for the money . i did buy the fabric railing protectors from babies-r-us to protect the round railings from a teeting baby since it is made of pine and they fit perfectly
1	we have had this puzzle toy since my son was one . ( he 's 3 now . ) it has provided hours of entertainment and education . we started by just showing him a few choices and matching , now he can easily do the whole box himself , and enjoys it . i like the textures , vibrant colors and nice large sturdy pieces . the nice sturdy box to hold them is great too .
0	my daughter is not even 2 yrs old and she is already having a hard time fitting into the potty -- i think this is the case for other types of potty seats too so i 'll be trying the type u attach to the adult seat and see how it goes
0	i purchased this wipe warmer because i did n't want a warmer that heats all the wipes . those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless . the top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes . well , this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box . it did n't even heat the whole wipe ! i am returning the warmer . it is a complete waste of money
0	i bought this set for my daughter . the bedding is such a poor quality , that my daughter wo n't sleep in her bed . she says the sheets are itchy . the comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard . i would not recomend this set to anyone ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i used this with my third child . i washed it over and over , and always , the stains came right out . it 's so soft ! ! ! ! definitely a good buy
1	great , fun product . my baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min . couple times a day . we own it from 2 months , he was 4 months old , he simply loves it . he jumps and plays with the toys . absolutely the best buy
0	if i could give it negitive stars i would ! we bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured . these gates are horrible and very poorly designed . every time someone tries to open the gate , it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart ! we have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse . and often it collapses anyway . now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through . now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these .
0	perhaps if i had n't already had a different type of bunting , i would n't be so disappointed with this one . my sister loaned me her eddie bauer bunting when my son was born . she will be having her next baby any week now , so i had to return it to her which meant i had to buy a new one . i saw nothing but great reviews on this product , so i picked one up . first of all , i followed the washing instructions , washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low , and it ripped at the one seam ! ! based on that alone , i will be returning it . aside from that , having used a bunting with a different design , i am not thrilled with this one . part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you 're in a car where you have heat , you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby does n't overheat . this bunting zips down both sides to the bottom ( by the way , zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around ; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot ) , rather than down the middle front ( that style zipper was never a problem ) . then you have this thick cover at baby 's feet and nowhere to go with it , as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car ! so you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest , or you have to leave it on baby 's legs . also , the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby 's face is n't covered unless you want it to be , but ... my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face . he did it this morning on the way to daycare . this bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that . and i ca n't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face ! there is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great , and that this particular bunting is toasty warm . it is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way , or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination . but i do n't think the design of the urban bundle-me is great and i actually think this bunting is too warm ( even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day , my son 's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat ) . after calling several stores and looking at all my options at babies 'r ' us , i ended up ordering a new eddie bauer all-season bunting from target.com ( which cost less than $ 20 including shipping ) . i ca n't wait till it gets here . i will be returning the $ 60 urban bundle-me as soon as i can
1	my son is only 2 months old so they are a little large right now . i 'm sure they will be perfect once he grows into them
0	these retail now for $ 229 at bru . just ridiculous . i own one , bought it on ebay for $ 28 since it was a local pickup only sale . i got a heckuva deal , i 'll admit ! this is a fantastic carseat ... ..but folks , it 's just an infant carseat ! i went looking on ebay for one , since , having had babies before , i could n't fathom shelling out even $ 100 for a cheapo , often-recalled graco , let alone $ 229 for a peg perego ! all new babies sweat in car seats ... .they ca n't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age , which is when they grow out of these seats ( unless your back goes first ) : ) . i understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents ... ..another folly of the infant gear industry . if car seats are in accidents , they 're junk folks ... ..they are n't in re-saleable condition . and when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby ? because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $ 229 carseat ( read : first child ) go out further than a trip to the store ? it 's a regular old car seat . they ca n't do much to these , really , except change the fabric . they pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy , so they gauge you on your emotions ... .hey , i 'm a sucker too ! infant seats are notoriously small , so that you have to buy up the next size faster . they get your money on the car seat and then the stroller , before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up . save your money ... ..your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months , no matter what ... ..and then it 's $ 229 right down the drain , faster than a speeding bullet ... ..guess you can save it for baby # 2 . think of it this way ... for the same amount of money , buy a britax roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months , or go on ebay and buy one of these , 4 months old and pretty much brand new , for less than half the new price
0	my son is 8 months old . he has outgrown his infant car seat , and is now in a larger seat , but still rear facing . i bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat . it does not help in this regard at all . in fact , it just annoys him . i have taken it off the car seat entirely , and i 'm not using it at all . very disappointed in californi
0	i received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow . although the tag reads `` 100 % cotton , '' it is most certainly not the soft , 100 % jersey cotton advertised . the print is cute , but i was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling . i gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising , but if one is looking for a nice , regular cotton crib sheet , this would probably be okay
1	so far our 7 month old son likes this toy . he watches the flashing lights , listens to the music and noises , and seems to like the different shaped blocks ( we have several other peek-a-boo blocks ) . he uses the handle to push the bus , flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on . it keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time . we thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it did n't flash . well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing . it also made the hood stay shut better . so maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem
1	this 2-in-1 is amazing . the scent is wonderful ... too bad they do n't make it for adults : ) a very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike . it actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully . i love mustela products so much that i got rid of every other product that i had that was n't mustela . fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products . try them and you 'll see why
1	it is a little costy but worth the money . it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways . since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness.a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight . once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover . its size is large enough to last many years .
1	the gate works well . it is a little hard to move the panels , but overall works well
1	i ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality softness of the fabrics . it 's beautiful and looks very nice and cozy . i have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed , so what i did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition . i also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa i have in the room .
1	i found one of these at a yard sale ... and it did n't have the suction cup portion . so , i have no idea if it 's a good high chair toy . however , the toy part gets 5 stars from my daughter ! she has been fascinated by this toy since she was 3 months old . now , she is 5 months , and she chooses this toy over all others . it is her favorite to chew on , bang around , grab , and study . the black and white handle ( that goes into the suction cup ) is very easy for her to hold . she can grasp it with both hands and bring it to her mouth . the mirror/smiley face ball is fun to watch . the rattle and noises it makes are fun , but not annoying
0	this wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid wo n't stay closed . i waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table . the wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid . do n't buy this wipe warmer , there are better ones out there .
0	the product says that around 20 weeks you should be able to hear the baby 's heartbeat . well , i 'm 30 weeks now and i still ca n't hear the baby 's heartbeat while using it . it was a total waste of money .
0	my son , who was used to using a wood stool ( 8 '' tall with slick wood feet ) fell climbing up on this because the top ( foot area ) is too small and it tipped on him ! it 's only 6 '' wide on top . not much room for clumsy toddlers to turn around on . if you push it in toward the toilet there is nothing left for the child to stand on . if you leave it out , then it takes up more room and the arc design is a waste . getting down he also started to fall because it was such a narrow top . his feet still dangled as he sat on the toilet - not coming near the top of this 8 1/2 '' tall stool . this is advertised as being 10 '' tall ( actually 8 1/2 '' ) 14 '' long ( correct , but top surface is only 11 1/2 '' ) and 10 '' wide ( also correct but again , it is only 6 '' wide on top ) the rubber feet are great for non-skid purposes , but that 's the only positive thing i have to say about this .
1	my son has now 'graduated ' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year . it is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats ' and your tub does n't accomdate the rings . in fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand . ours has withstood a year of use so far and we 'll be using it with the next baby too
0	i do n't usually bother complaining about products , but this thermometer was such a waste of $ , i just wanted to save someone else the trouble . the temperature readings on this are sooo inaccurate . every time that we check a temp . it is different , it varies alot . just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got . every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees . it reads low sometimes , so you may have a temperature and not be aware . and we could n't even take it back to the store . do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.we did n't have any luck with a diffferent brand either , the ear ones are all off , but not as bad as this one
1	this pail does not need special plastic bags -- you can use leftover grocery bags , etc. , which is a big advantage . i do n't know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper -- a baby 's poop does not smell bad !
1	i used this for my daughter who always falls alseep in the car and has her head dangling all over the place . it works great ! her head actually stays in the right position and she sleeps better ... which is a plus
1	this is one of my favorite products i have purchased as a new mommy . i love it . it warms the avent bottles great . it took some trials to determine how much water to add but now i have it down great . you can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful . it is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water . it does not warm the playtex ventair bottles . i guess because of the vent but i preferred the avent bottles anyway . the cooler does keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day . we have a 2 story house and this helped us so much . i have the other first year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well . this is definitly worth the money
0	i wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy . i will say our child is a bright , out-going 8 month old now , but in the beginning she was colicky and a terrible napper ! i thought this was a brilliant idea , but began to realize that many of the bright , gifted children i know did n't have exposure to this system . it is loud to wear and not so comfortable . you are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening . good luck if you choose to purchase , but just think , einstein was fine with out one
1	my granddaughter is one year old . she absolutly loves her new walker . she is small for her age so the adjustable height is perfect
0	it started loosing air after just a few uses . i was so excited when i ordered the item , but now i 'm extremely mad
0	we got this as a gift and have used it 0 times . it 's expensive and poorly designed . a large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper , easier to fold , and nicer looking
1	my two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world . it 's so easy to get him to take a bath now ! the crayons are great and come off the tub easily ... i give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off . the compartment to keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open . thank you for making this !
0	i had this when my daughter was first born . it worked ok but she seemed pretty curled up in it . when she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped -- luckily i had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything . i was able to return the product , but i bought the snugli carrier instead -- i would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles .
1	i tried several different bottles , including avent and second nature , and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and did n't flow too fast or make her gag . the nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital ( which is the only pacifier she will take as well ) . i am breastfeeding , and with all of the trouble i was having findnig a bottle , i was worried about what would happen when i went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle . this bottle has eased my mind . also , the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles . the reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight , but as long as i make sure it is tight i have no problems
1	i got this hat because it matched the jj cole bundle me blanket for my son 's car seat . he looks absolutely adorable in it , but he hates wearing it unfortunately . the elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down . overall , if your baby is a hat-wearer and this fits him/her , then it 's wonderful . it 's warm , soft and is made very well
1	do n't bother with bulky snowsuits . this makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby . we live in the north east , so it is a life saver . yummy snuggly
0	this wipe warmer is more trouble than it 's worth . the water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table . as a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes . i emailed the manufacturer regarding this product to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective . they failed to respond
1	i have two children now , and i wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born . i have tried everything to keep my babies ' heads from slumping over in the car , and nothing worked 100 % of the time . this however does . it is one of the best things i have ever purchased for my child and it 's very inexpensive
0	with the rear-facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan , this mirror limits driver visability . when the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror , a large section of the back windshield is blocked . i 'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror
1	it took no time to figure out how to use this seat . my daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements , so i am moving here from a 5 point harness britax to this booster in a second car . the seat is easy to install and remove , and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding . i can definately see using it for travel on planes , as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry . my daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water . they are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat . highly recommended .
0	when my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings , this pillow worked well . it was propped well enough to support my son 's head when he took a nap . but when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings , this pillow was not usable at all
0	only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm ... if you do n't refill the container continously , wipes get cold . plus , you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer
1	the snuzzler works well for our small baby in his graco metrolite stroller . it supports his head well and he seems very comfortable sitting on it .
0	this is the worst monitor ! i thought being digital monitor it would be great . i was totally wrong ! i could n't even get it to work ! do n't waste your $
1	we used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size . he was sleeping through the night almost immediately . part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled . we used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free . a def must have for every baby
1	these work really well , but be sure to get a couple of the magnets , because we lost our first one and then we were all hosed for a while
0	this gate is almost totally useless -- unless your doorways and walls are all /perfectly/ plumb and square and happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock , that is ...
0	this was given to us as a present , but i would have never bought it for myself . here are the problems : 1 ) we have a platform bed and you can not shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper . we still tried to use it as a bassinet but ... 2 ) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it . i tried to put extra padding which worked ok , but still not great . 3 ) once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room , but the bassinet part is fixed . i would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet . ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months
1	my house was built in 1862 and i have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized , crooked doorways . this gate ( when hardware mounted ) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could . i agree that it 's not easy to use , you have to readjust the size each time it 's opened or closed , but for me it 's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways . also , the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it super easy to install . i 'm very happy with this gate
0	i bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in georgia and so far have not been impressed . two problems . 1 ) the wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son 's tushy they are lukewarm at best . 2 ) they advertise how intelligent their top warming design it , but that 's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product . once you get half way through your wipes , there is n't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device ( placed directly below the lid ) since they can not reach it . they should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting . i will continue to use it but wish i had though more about the product 's design
0	frustration is how i sum up my experience with this product . on the front cover , and with the directions on the back , there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock . however , after opening the packaging , there was no key . there were four locks , alright . and , lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in , despite the product 's claim to be the only child lock that does n't require tools . with how the packaging is designed , i do n't even think there 's room for the key . which makes me wonder ... do you have to buy the key separately ? i 'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy
0	we bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived . we had previously used a diaper genie , that we no longer had - it worked fine , but was expensive . we decided to buy the diaper dekor because of the odor free guarantee . do n't buy it . the guarantee or the pail ! it stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it . we have kept it in the garage , and also outside . not convenient . refills are expensive . and worse yet - my one year old can get dirty diapers out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front ! ! ! who designed this thing ? ? ?
1	i purchased the sesame beginnings walker and my daughter loves it . there is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself . it also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them . this walker makes noise and lights up . there is n't any paint on her walker and i do n't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter
1	another great purchase received on time and in excellent condition . ca n't say enough good things about the vendor and the shipping process ; it was painless and full of customer service ; a rarity these days
1	book looks exactly like the picture and the colors are vivid and nice . the only thing is the puppet holes are really small meant for small fingers , so you as a parent might not be able to show your child how to use the puppet feature . i like this line of books better the the bright starts and baby einstein books
0	i read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap ... .at first i was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby ( although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big ) . my stroller is a pretty typical stroller , nothing special or comlpicated about it . but yes , it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which did n't really work because it is so flimsy . after about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage at all . piece of junk .
0	the baby bjorn is a nice carrier . i received one for my baby shower . however , i hardly used it . i thought i would use it a lot but i found i hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much . before that , the many straps made me afraid i was going to drop the baby . but probably the same problem for other carriers . i was really surprised by how little i used it , since i really wanted to carry my bab
1	we are using this bather for our son who is one month old . what we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby . the fabric is also very soft , quick drying , and removable for machine washing . the model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby 's waist . to keep him warm , we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath . since we do n't fill up the tub with water , slippage has not been a problem
1	we bought this crib online could n't be more pleased . the shipping was great - a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable . the directions are n't bad - but they could be a lot better/clearer . we also bought the matching change table it looks great in the baby 's room . net , great value for a great product !
0	my baby was playing with the giggle ball when one of the caps fell off and all of the beads spilled on the floor . please use caution with this toy ! the toy was n't being played with roughly and the floor was carpeted . there was no reason for the toy to fall apart
0	the idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them . the execution , however , is lousy . using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying . i prefer the lansinoh bags with the double seal . even though you ca n't pump straight into them , sealing them is quick and easy
0	this gate is horrible to try to open and close ... do n't try to pinch pennies when it 's your little one 's safety and your convenience at stake . buy the configure gate instead ... you 'll be glad you did . it is well worth every penny ... this one is n't worth a thing
1	awesome , awesome , awesome ! my hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality , design , and function about products and he loves this carrier . i liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else . he tolerates being in this more than his stroller . this was my first choice based on all the feedback . thanks
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old . i could barely zip it around b/c it is so small . i keep checking the tags to make sure i got the right size and not the infant one . i looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem . it 's a great product for smaller children
0	i was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by . i tried it out with a baby doll first and i ended up covering the snuggle nest with my blankets in the middle of the night .
1	i absoulutly love these cups . they are the best no-spill cups on the market . my 1-year old loves to walk around with it and throw it around . it never spills which is a great thing when i have red kool-aid in it ! ! !
1	it works really well . it 's stable ( the little guy is trying to climb ) and holds a lot
1	i have been using the graco snugride since my son was about 2 months old - he 's now five months old . the seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry . as the product name suggests , my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat . the only problem that i have is with the process for adjusting the harness . the buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily . i have found that i have to get behind the seat and really work at the straps and the buckles to adjust the seat properly , which is difficult to do if the seat and baby are already in the car . apart from that , the seat provides good value for the price
1	this is my third child and third infant car seat . this was the most expensive , but worth the money . the padding keeps the baby 's head from that scary 90 degree flop ; the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids ; the straps do n't get twisted and it 's much easier to get in and out of the car . it 's the same weight as the others ( which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry ) . the only thing i do n't like is it does not fit on shopping carts . worth the money
1	well , i felt a little silly paying about $ 20 ( with shipping ) for 2 pieces of plastic , 2 bra hooks , and some rubber bands . however , the kit does work , and does allow you to pump hands free . one word of caution - if you use medela 's quick clean steam bags to clean your pump parts , take the hands free plastic sleeves off before throwing the bag in the microwave ! otherwise , they warp and do n't fit right
0	we ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase . first of all , we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work , since they make you order each little piece separately . we spent all night putting it together and it did n't work for us . the actual gate is very small , i do n't see how it would be big enough for any opening . even with the extension kit , it was still not long enough . the extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart . it is a very poor design and way overpriced . we spent over $ 150 ( with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy ) for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart . save your money and buy a different gate
1	i had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an avent bottle ( which my first took beautifully ) so i called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice . they suggested the evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple . they worked great . after swearing by avent with my first , i never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an `` old-fashioned '' type bottle . it works though so i will stick with them
0	do n't buy this sheet ! ! it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper ! spit up would go right through it . i have a much better solution for you -- buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack-n-play . they are a couple of $ $ less and are sold as `` especially for baby '' ( which is b-r-us house brand ) . they are great . i use them for both my son 's crib and for the pack n play . they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern
0	i bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface . they fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around . also a few of my knobs pull off easily . my son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come , both knob and cover . then it 's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover . they do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to . i 'm just not sure if it 's worth it . it probably depends on your stove
0	we had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son . boy , were we wrong . the first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart . so we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again . he only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50 ... .i would definitely not recommend this to anyone .
0	this product is nice at first but you 'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you do n't have to put anymore holes in your home . i 've bought 5 of them over 4 years . we have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking . do not buy , buy something better and higher quality so that you wo n't have to replace in 6 months . please listen to this review . it will save you
0	[ ... ] to see how worthless the graco lovin ' hug swing is . the baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds ( the swing has a supposed 30-pound limit ) . the swing is on hard floors , is brand new , as are the batteries , and still the swing barely moves at all , even on the highest level ! when i contacted the company , they told me that the swing wo n't go as high when a baby gets larger , but this brief movie proves that it wo n't `` go '' at all ! ! instead , i highly recommend the fisher price ocean wonders aquarium swing . i only wish it held a larger baby so i could continue to use it ! [ ...
0	we live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs my husband runs an isp from home - lots of computers in the house , so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics outside world , but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly . at first i was thrilled the sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved that i could set it to voice-activated only hear it when she 's reallllly awake ! but that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back to the old fp sounds lights one we had which really was n't any better ! ( and having to run up down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver transmitter of the sony was a royal pain ! ) the next day i went to target found the first years digital 2.4ghz monitor what a difference ! it was about the same price as the sony , but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does . i was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones , but after a week , no problems we have no static/interferrence ! it 's crystal clear no matter where in the house ( hubby even took it into the computer room was able to hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone 's environment is different , but the sony definately did n't work for us
0	my husband and i were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born . he has been using it up to now , and i used it this week for the first time . our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds . it was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone . the problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain i have after just a two mile walk ! ! ! i ca n't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk ! ! ! i would never recommend that someone buys this !
1	love it ! fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it
1	this nursery care kit is great ! before buying another care kit consider the following points , with the time and frustration you will save ... you 'll be glad you did . the first week home from the hospital i used the nasal aspirator countless times . it is very gentle but very effective . the digital thermometer is quick and easy to use . so much better than the glass and mercury kind . the medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby . the nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby 's finger . anyone that has ever cut their baby 's finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that ! the items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store . great to keep in your diaper bag for when you 're on the go
0	in theory this sounds awesome , but in reality is comes really close to being useless . 1 ) the `` spa '' is nothing more than a light flow of water which is n't even enough to create bubbles , it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby 2 ) the shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds , the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair . a cup does a better job than this . 3 ) the tub itself is pretty decent , the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus . all in all i wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub , i advise anyone else to do the same
1	this item works for me perfect . i had ordered two of them , but found one did so well i have returned the second one . there was nothing wrong with it , i just had no need for it . for the record . i am not using this for a child . it is used to restrain the movements of a pet . it works perfect for that , so i am sure it would do wonders for a child
1	we have a very small kitchen so i knew i could never have a large highchair . i registered for the healthy chair by fisher price but after putting my son in it once to try it out i returned it for this one and never regretted it . this one has a higher back , reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable ( the one i have is better than the one shown . i bought it at babiesrus ) . it actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc/123 plastic mats that go on the tray . my son is very comfortable in it and i love that we can take it anywhere .
0	when my daughter was tiny , she enjoyed being in this sling ... on the one or two occasions i managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes . the cotton fabric does n't offer much support for the baby 's weight and i found it became uncomfortable very quickly . it also did n't feel as secure as some of the padded , over-the-shoulder style slings . i actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times , which defeats the purpose .
0	for the price of this cradle/swing , i 'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than i got . first , the stand seemed a little wobbly -- you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they do n't lock into an optimal position . even worse , however , is that after less than two days of use , the lights , sound , and mobile stopped working . calls to `` customer service '' were a complete waste of time and i ended up returning the item . while the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable , i 'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive papasan cradle/swing
1	i ca n't tell you how much i love this product ! ! ! i live in colorado and we 've had tons of snow/cold weather this winter and now i ca n't even imagine zipping my 4-month-old into a snowsuit . it 's so easy to slip her right it , zip it up and go ! i have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down -- this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy . i chose this urban style over the original because i liked the way it looked , but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons i like it better . first , it washes beautifully ! the liner stays soft and looks the same as the day i bought it -- unlike sherpa fleece . second , the outside fabric is waterproof . once i spilled a small soda on the bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off ! it never soaked into the fabric and left a stain
0	this monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it . also , it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet ( - from our daughter 's bedroom to the kitchen ) . i would definitely not recommend this product , and had i not lost the receipt , i would have returned it
0	this product was a waste of my money . it was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use . my husband tore it off the day after we got it . i would rather use duck tape then this product : ) :
0	... not much more ... for us , at least . we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors ! but when it come down to it , we just could n't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby . we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and `` breast friend '' sling much better . sigh , such a waste of a pretty sling . ; -
1	being that we had our baby in december , this was a godsend . instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat , my wife or i would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket . works great
1	like many new parents , i had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib ... well ... upon his arrival , my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and i for the first 6 weeks , plus he helped my husband and i sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made ( for a new parent all the sounds are scary ) . we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine , and went back to sleep . yes , it was a bit tight in a queen size bed , but most importantly , he was safe and we did not have to get up . we used in bed until 6 weeks old , and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks . overall , well worth it , plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months
1	i do n't have twins , however i have an infant and a toddler and it works great for them . i go jogging every morning with the kids and it is the most comfortable stroller i have used yet . thank you ! !
1	we bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats . he was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly could n't handle the full size version . this tub is a perfect in between option . the only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub
0	this toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move . it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror . the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat .
1	wow ! this is the best thing i received for my baby . it has saved me sooo much time . i would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but i just do n't need to worry with this . i feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters , and the aunt who bought her a snow suit . we just never use them . i can zip her into the bundle me and head out for a walk in the stroller . she usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy . when she was smaller , we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller . it meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination . she never felt the cold ! it is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats .
1	i got this system for my 18 mo . old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was `` stuck '' . they have helped prevent him from doing that any more . however , if he 's in the mood , he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it wo n't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to . in fact , the two end panels had to be removed because he would n't leave them alone . all in all though , i think the mesh `` bumpers '' do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys ( and pluggers ) in the crib instead of out on the floor
1	the original nursers enabled me to return to work after a long maternity leave . my baby would n't take the bottle until i introduced the brown rubber nipple . thanks mom
0	i thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son 's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept . the first night we used it , my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports . he was horrified that our son could have suffocated . this was after i had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits . i suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby did n't move at all
1	my little guy loved this from the start . this is a versatile toy that lasted many months . the mat is machine washable , so it became our take along for travel . the hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere , such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows . he 's now 2 yrs , and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room ! this was a great investment
0	this sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap . there are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle
0	i have owned the bed and it is very dangerous for a child . i am stunned that this product is still on the market . while it is very cute , and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for . my daughter loved the look of this -- - her first `` big girl '' bed . that was until it fell to pieces with her in it ! the metal rails that are to hold the bed together , and the matress in place , are not properly planned out . if you can even manage to get this bed built -- - which is difficult , much more so than it seems at first -- -- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed . it is flimsy , poorly designed , dissapointing , and dangerous . delta should be ashamed
0	this carrier did n't survive one airline trip . the bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip . this carrier is junk . waste of my money
1	surprisingly , its been hard to find a two compartment dish for baby food . this one works great and comes with a nice spoon that fits on top of the dish for storage . it is a great size and lightweight for taking in the diaper bag for eating out too
1	just love it ! i had the jeep tandem and it was nice until my son got so big ( 40 lbs , 39 inches ) you could n't steer it very well . the bob is amazing ! i have a 3 yr 1 yr old . you ca n't feel the weight difference . it rides so nicely . both my children are very tall/heavy ( dense ) for their age and my eldest has plenty of room to grow - which was my biggest concern . my husband just loves the shocks - go figure . it compacts nicely ... .and if you need it even more compact the wheels come off in a snap and can be stored in the seat . it 's amazing ! i 'm so glad i purchased it . rei has a great price on it ( $ 400+/- ... tried ebay too but rei was best . have fun in your stroller search and good luck
1	we got two bundlemes for our twin infant sons . the product handles , wears and washes well . this product is great for taking your infant for outdoor walks or for very cold climates . the only problem we have come across : on not so cold winter days the boys often become sweaty and uncomfortable in their car seats during my 30 minute commute
0	we tried these after getting one of the portable mats that did n't work out . this item too did n't work for us . it wo n't stick it there is a table cloth . then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand ! it really ended up being more trouble than it was worth . we started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag ... we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it . at 14 months she does n't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out .
1	due to the room layout , i needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed . we do n't live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these `` in person '' and then decide which one best fit our needs . so we purchased 4 brands of bed rails . after looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out , we decided to keep the safe and secure double bedrail by the first years . to help others , i have attached two customer 's photos to this product description . these photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail . why amazon/target ca n't get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me . but that seems to happen many times . this bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed . this is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took . the reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows : ( 1 ) it is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed . ( 2 ) this was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible . ( 3 ) the quality of the construction ( especially of the spring loaded locking pins ) was much better than that of the sleeptite bed rail we looked at from regalo and one step ahead ( which is also made by regalo . ) ( 4 ) the design made more sense than the regalo . the installation was more straightforward . possible issues with this bed rail are as follows : ( 1 ) it is only 17 '' high , so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit . in our case , our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10-11 '' high , depending on where you measure it . so we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress . but i could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue . ( 2 ) this was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down . others had more substantial locking mechanisms . i could see where a toddler who watched you do this , could then do it himself . so we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler , only during sheet changes . only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be . despite these two issues , we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us . however , if we are later disappointed with this bed rail , i will go and update our review .
1	this chair is larger than some of the seats out there , and fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well . some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use , as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats ! the seat is shaped just right for splashes , and it seems comfortable . now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day , we 'd be in business ! i love the simple design , my son loves the color ( he picked it out himself ) , and it 's so simple to clean . it also has grips on the bottom so that it wo n't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it -- a must
1	i absolutely love these paci keepers and highly recommend them . they are the only ones that my son does n't manage to rip off of himself . i got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear-facing car seat . that made for a horrible trip . i purchased these and they are awesome !
1	this is amazing i tell ya , seriously i 've doubted it since my first child , and then my twins ( never got it ) with them , just assumed it was some hype . well with my last baby , and finally a girl , i caved . its hard to hold a baby all day long when you hve 3 other children and a home to keep in order ( or try ) anyway her screams were out of no where , she was n't happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you . and sometimes that was n't good enough . she cried and cried and waled . it really drove us all bonkers . she is n't a pacifyer baby either , so we were at loss . she was obviously really gassy , she got hiccups alot . she 's breastfed and we could n't figure out what it was , that maybe i was eating ? sure enough today we tried it , and she 's peacefully sleeping without stirring . i recomend it 110 % . my husband got it at his work with a 20 % discount , i 'm so relieved
1	i have twin boys that are 3 and i love this chair . it does n't have a lid or removable splash gurad . i have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with . putting the lids up and down , taking out the removable seat and catch basin , etc . this simply constructed unit has no corners or edges . it has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin . the catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty . it is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with . i think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys . this seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet , which i think does n't work anyway - on the other potty chairs i purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe . i recommend the babybjorn toilet trainer for that
0	we do n't have our baby yet -but have tried the tub to see if it works . the first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it . this second one the spa works but the shower does n't . the company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor . will try it again with the new motor of if the third one does n't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money
0	the toy box is nice , but im not happy with the product . the directions were difficult to understand and i did n't like the top being made of cloth material . my little boy already made a tear on it . i had to remove it , i was afraid my little boy would tear it
1	this product saves time and for people that hygiene freak ... ..this is a good one . wash yor baby bottle ... .dry them and sterilise as needed . also i take to work to sterilise my pump and bottle before pumping with the parts since it is just few minutes
1	the sweet pea bedding set is a good buy the quality of the workmanship is excellent has a high end look for a low end price
1	we have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she 's almost 2 now . we keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of `` pocket bibsters . '' whenever we eat out at a restaurant , we stick this down at our toddler 's place . she sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate , it spills onto this nice clean mat . the mat also has entertainment value , as she can name the items on it . after she 's made her mess , we just peel the mat off , wad it up , and throw it away
0	we had the diaper dekor plus and it seems that i 'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell . the first couple of months were n't bad , but after about 3 months or so , it really started to smell bad . this horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on . we tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it `` air out '' outside , cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution , putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner , letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water ... we even bought some scented disc type things ( can be purchased at babies r us ) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse . we continued to use it , but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with lysol or something . eventually we used it less and less , and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we 'd had it for almost 2 years . we knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they could n't get rid of it . it was a real shame because aside from the smell , it was a great product
0	i was very disappointed in the product . the picture does not accurately represent the armoire . the entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood , not cherry wood at all . the pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet , in addition to the outside . also , pieces did come chipped , cracked and one piece was also split into two ! ! ! i returned the item and wish i had n't ordered in the first place
0	we purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them . right out of the box , the seat pad would n't stay on the seat and slides around during use . i figured i could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway . after only 5 or 6 uses however , the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago . i tried to contact evenflo to report this problem , but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product . they told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase ( and you have to have proof of purchase ) . they did offer to send me out a replacement part , but under the circumstances , i do n't feel comfortable using the seat at all , so i 'll be destroying and disposing of it . i explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat , but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem . thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash , or my son certainly would have been seriously injured . we have n't had any problems yet with the other seat , but i 'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe . after their horrible customer service , i wo n't be buying another evenflo anything ever again .
1	i love this carrier ( i bought it in feb 2007 ) . my daughter loves it too . she can sleep very well in it . the only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb , while mine is already 17lb ( she is only 3 months ) . i guess i do n't have too much time to use it . if this company could develop a one which suits for big baby , i will definitely buy it . ji
1	i installed this today though i have n't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy . i was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo , but after getting it and installing it , it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me . it also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat . i 'm giving the chair five stars because i ca n't think of anything negative about it
1	i love this bottle dryer . it was a little pricey but worth it ! it holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop . i never put bottles , binkies , etc . away anymore . i just leave them because it is so convienent
1	the size is bigger than i thought but i loved it . my son fits in nicely
1	this toy is a favorite of my 10 month old . he likes the crinckle fin and the mirror . he also loves the music , which calms him down when he is crying . the music is soothing and does n't grate on our nerves even though we 've heard it many times . my only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play . it would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times . there are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the einstein theme . all in all , a good product that i would buy again . by the way , the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle
1	we also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller ( limosine style ) and our pack-n-play . in addition to bugs , it keeps leaves , etc . from falling into the play pen . my in-laws loaned us a second play-pen that was older and larger than the one 's sold these days . the netting also fit that but not as snugly
0	maybe in time i will figure this plate out , but i can not get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart , use the suction , clean it out . it may seem simple , but a harried mother needs these details ! i am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me , at least as far as being a stay-put dish , which is why i purchased it .
0	i bought this bundle me in nov and it did not even last 2.5 months . the zipper broke . it is not well made . stick with the other bundle mes . the urban bundle me is cheaply made . not worth the pric
1	i am using the babyplus system for the second time and am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old . faith was born alert , calm , and hardly cried at all as an infant . she slept through the night right away with only waking to eat . she is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write , sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts . her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble . her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn . she has great coordination with activities and sports . i am a nurse and i tell all my patients and friends about the babyplus system . i am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that i would use the babyplus system again . do not be afraid to try something new . just read the studies and reviews , they speak for themselves . you will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child .
1	product shipped quickly and was well packaged . each loop or hole on the edge has an individual string that you have to tread . would have been better if the strings were attached to the netting . overall , the product works very well and gave us the protection for our child we were looking for . our 22 month old tested it contiually by pushing hard and running into it and there were no problems
1	this was a great carseat and carrier . easy to install with the level indicator . a few drawbacks : once my daughter was a few months old , it got really heavy to carry around . she also outgrew it by 6 months . the harness needs to be longer . it does n't release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably . and for some reason , the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use . my mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood ( because she could n't move the handle up ) or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom ( because she could n't move the handle back ) . my advice , before you buy , realisticly test everything on it in the store and compare it directly to another brand
1	use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening . one minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile . all and all it is a very good product
1	my daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it ( at 8 months ) . it was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first . i took one star off due to some minor problems : 1 ) it is not machine washable ( unless you do n't mind loosing the barking sound ) and 2 ) the battery ca n't be replaced .
1	we 've used this since our baby was born three months ago . it has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own . it has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear ( as well as inside compartments ) . it also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use . the bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around . our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but i have seen it used on older children . we 'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting
0	i bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective ! after a few days , they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down . this product is a piece of junk
1	this product works well with my dr brown 's bottles . there are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles . much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks . i use a sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it wo n't scratch the bottles , though . the sassy color totally coordinates perfectly
1	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did . we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day . the jumperoo has sturdy construction , and the 4 settings are useful . i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it , but he 's been fine . he does n't play with the toy attachment . i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame
1	we like this car seat for the price we paid . likes : love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately . the 5 point harness is great . love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers . dislikes : it does n't recline as much as we 'd like and the head padding is superficial . our baby 's head tends to fall forward a lot . the sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately , but does n't move easily . finally , the handle is difficult to move from position to position . overall though , for the price , it 's a good seat .
0	i thought this would be great for the size . the changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic . it provides no padding at all . the case itself is padded . why did n't they use the padding on the changing `` pad '' instead of the case ? very uncomfortable for baby . ( it is basically like laying out a piece of paper . ) i 'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags
0	i too thought that since we had such great luck with avent bottles , that we would love their `` magic '' cups . i am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups . it seems like the lid and cup do n't seal together well enough to withstand any activity . i 'm sad to have to give avent a bad rating , but do n't waste your money on these cups
1	i bought 3 packages of dr. brown 's ( through amazon.com ) standard size nipples and i received 2 standard and 1 wide . they shipped the wrong item to me . i returned the wide to the address in calabasas , california and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to right start . i enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him . since my purchase , i still have not received anything except this email from amazon.com . i rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star
1	i really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good . the only thing i dont like is the way the strings work . there are not enough and also they rip off easily . not stitched well for the price . generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed , also suffication could be a problem . we have bought a convertable crib ( common in europe ) which can be used till approx . age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later . anyhow we still love it . it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari .
1	i think everyone should one of these , especially for when their kids are young . my 8mo . old tries to eat everything . i do n't want him chewing on the handlebars of grocery cars ( yuck ! ) and it makes it much cleaner when you put him in a highchair at restaurants ( which are sometimes disgusting ) . the best part it fits over extra large shopping carts at club stores , like [ ... ] , unlike other types
1	i didnt know these things exsisted with my first child , now that i found them i use it constantly ! this floppy seat is much better then others you can get for a little cheaper , but in the long run this is the best for your money ! i have washed it at least half a dozen times , and its washes great ! i also am so glad to have one seat the works for the cart as well as the highchair . the other products i saw you had to buy one for each item . it was almost double the cost . it does take a few minutes to get it hooked up , but its worth it for the quiet and germ free shopping experience , and my son is so ccomfy in it ! i have had lots of people ask me where we got it . i love the added extras of having a cup holder pocket and some places to hook up some toys . it is very plush and made of great fabric , it is not cheap in anyway . this is one item i dont intend to live without , i also think this is a great shower gift for anyone expecting ! i cant say enough about this product
1	you will need this extra base ! ! i ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have . the day after it arrived my mother-in-law was sick and could n't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up . i had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened
1	i was that parent who said `` i 'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer -- it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer . '' and then i woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who does n't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily -- this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me . i am now a big fan of the warmer . it works very quickly and does n't dry them out , and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up . definately a nice product .
1	the wedge , along with a vaporizer , helps my three-month-old sleep better at night . sometimes she slides down , but she used to slide around before the wedge , too . most nights she stays on the wedge just as i positioned her and i think it helps with winter 's stuffy noses . it 's easy to use and not that expensive .
1	this is our third baby monitor . the first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices . this one has worked flawlessly in our home w/ zero static . the talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old ( `` go back to sleep , '' `` i 'll get you juice in the morning , '' etc . ) not having to get up and go to the child 's room is a real feature . the only reason i gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals are n't encrypted . anyone else with an fm receiver can pick up your conversations , but most monitors are this way . we took the monitor to a friend 's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house ( video monitor , tv , i do n't know . ) since it only had two channels , we were not able to find a clear channel . overall thoughts : best monitor i 've had ( stay away from the fisherprice models ) . i would buy again unless i was in an apartment complex ( i would n't want other people listening in ) , and i would be prepared to take it back if i needed more channels
1	we tried three other brands and types of gates on the market . two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing $ 66 ! the two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install . this evenflo gate was put together , installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs have n't been able to budge it one inch . plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls . great product at a bargain price - we 're ordering three more
1	this nursing bra is extremely comfortable , once you get it on . it is difficult to get over the chest and back . you practically need 5 hands because it tends to roll under as you 're pulling it down your back . i 've been wearing it during my pregnancy , i ca n't imagine how much more difficult it may be to put on when my breasts have grown after the delivery . i give it 4 stars though for it 's comfort . once it 's on you hardly know you 're wearing a bra , and the snaps have been easy to undo and resnap with one hand . because they are plastic snaps though , i 'm wondering how long they will last with 7-8 feedings a day . i will write more on this once the baby arrives ( 5 more weeks ! )
0	when i purchased these drapes , i assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the zanzibar valences , sheets , etc . wrong ! the material is striped , and is a darker , different shade of brown than the rest of the set . i love the other items in this set , but do n't waste your money on these drapes -- they look awful
0	it made my breasts look funny , it made my nipples more irritable it left painful marks on my breasts . hardly ever used it . :
1	this product was recently purchased for my 5 1/2 month old son 's stroller by my mother-in-law i love it . i had an older hand-me-down version for his infant carrier but the new ones are better . i love the fact that the new version has velcro so you can easily move it from car seat to stroller or from one stroller to another.i only wish it came in more colors color combinations
1	this product works great . you hook it to your medella bra with rubber bands and pump with hands free to do other things . i am so glad a coworker told me about this product
1	the bundleme is a must for any mom . it works so well ! it really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets . the first time i used it i thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so i put a jacket on her . as soon as i was indoors and took her out of the bundleme i saw that she was too warm . she was actually sweating . ever since then i use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy . we have lots of snow and cold winters where i live and the bundleme original was perfect . no more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car . the top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it 's the only part that needs washed you do n't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece . you can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you 'll be indoors for a short period of time . i think that every mom should have one and i would definitely buy one again
1	we had just started to potty train my 2 year old little girl when a trip to disney world came . to be honest i did n't know what to do because she would n't go potty on the big potty . i felt like we were going to have to take a whole week off from potty training her . a full week at disney world was not going to be fun carrying a potty seat around . then i found this at babies r us ! ! ! what a little blessing to little ones . it fits perfect on any potty and she can go without being afraid of the potty . plus it fit perfect in my wendy bellissimo diaper bag . i carry it everywhere ! ! i do n't leave home without it . thanks for such a wonderful product that helped make our first trip to disney world so much better ! !
0	i bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant . i thought it would be the only pump i would need , but it did n't work ! i found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in . i was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on . i tried this pump and it would not maintain suction ! i did n't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand ( very painful at the time ) just so my daughter could latch on . i have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me ! i was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it . a waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare
0	we bought this about 6 weeks ago , and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm . now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off . basically , i believe minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product . not recommended at all ... i would prefer some other brand
0	very disappointed . i bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after i pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant . it has not helped me and has been annoying . the l-xl is too large but the s-m was too small . the material folds and rolls under my clothes and there 's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go . i get sweaty underneath it and it 's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom -- -which i 'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks ! this was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop i went to . i wish i 'd had the chance to try on others to compare
0	seems like a good idea for a seat . i liked the handles for them to hold on to ( more sanitary ) and it sits okay on a big adult seat . but the opening is just too small . it is not the lack of a deflector . i have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one . this one the pee gets all over his legs , the seat , the stool and the floor each and every time . this is a big hassle , unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty . maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy . we are shopping for a replacement now . i do n't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt . we just teach him to point `` it '' down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine
1	finally a cute pink car seat . it is duralble and easy to lift around . i wish they had this cute color for my other daughter . ihave not deliverd yet so i do n't know how she will fit in it , but i also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is . there is not any other pink combo out there . i just hope it works as well as it shows off
1	this seat works very well . my son feels secure on it and it is easy to use . highly recommended
1	this bin is great for cloth diapers . we love ours . keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two 's worth of diapers -- which is all i need because we wash every other day . our local babies r us sells replacement deodisks ( or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors ) when the one that comes with it loses it 's smell so that you can maintain freshness . it 's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive
1	i received my original new native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997 . i wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies # 2 and # 3 . now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn ( we have the purple one ) , so i thought it time to buy a second sling . the original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we 'll still use it , but i 'm a bit tired of the purple color after nine years ! : ) pros : this sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you . it 's a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily . men do n't mind wearing it ( at least my husband did n't ) , it comes in basic solid colors and does n't scream `` baby ! '' when you 're out and about . many people could n't tell i was wearing the baby when she was little . it 's a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse , once you figure that out . it 's more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler ( i 've even used it with two-year-olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller is n't an option ) . you can carry the baby on your front or back ( with experience , this is doable , but mostly for older babies ) , on your hip ( once your baby can sit strongly ) . it 's also easy to throw in the wash when the baby 's diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it . ( no complicated latches , webbing or snaps to clean . ) cons : if you get the wrong size , the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt . my original is the large size ( based on chest measurements from the manufacturer ) but i 'm going to order a medium this time . my husband still likes the large , but he has a longer torso than i. newborns may need some support in the new native sling , otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric . i always use a tightly rolled-up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first , then lay the baby 's head and back on top of it . this pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you do n't feel like she 's lost in there . usually i only do this for the first few weeks . after a while , your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people . the trickiest thing with the new native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back , which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps . you have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it . if you can master this , the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all-day babywearing . highly recommended ! good value for your money .
1	this is the perfect mattress for my little princess . it 's nice and cushy while providing the necessary firmness . the vinyl cover is easy to wipe off if there are accidents . it 's also lightweight for easy sheet changings . sealy provides a solid , trusted product . not necessary to spend a lot of money on a mattress your child will use for 2-4 years . my baby sleeps comfortably on it every night and she 's tough to please ! so i would definitely recommend this product to other parents
1	very easy to use , and comfortable , it did n't bother my daughter when she was asleep . stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be . easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night . washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year
0	i was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy , they button onto the car seat and it is n't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off . the are no longer attached to the seats because i refuse to keep putting them back on . i guess this seat is okay , it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat ( which i did n't think about before i purchased this ) was the fact that the kids ca n't fall asleep in these seats . my kids like i am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out . but because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually do n't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then i worry because i do n't want them to get a crook in their neck . i can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat .
0	we bought this item , because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else . we had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples/caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it , we have to attach it back on . not very durable .
1	i need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room . it 's used for an office and playroom , and it 's the coldest room in the house so i like to keep the door open . my daughter 's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell , so i bought this one . it took 7 minutes to install , it 's not going anywhere , and it 's very easy to open and close . my dogs ca n't climb over it because the bars are vertical . i love it , am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8-year-old daughter 's bedroom
1	i love this car seat except for the fact that the one i have is defective . the crotch snap does not work properly . when i contacted baby trend , they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free , even though mine was manufactured in october 2006 i contacted them in december - less than a month after i bought it . otherwise , this is a wonderful seat . i love the triangular handle . i use it with the snap go and have no trouble at all transferring her . if she falls asleep in it , it is easy to take her wherever i want without disturbing her . she seems very comfortable in it as well . she was born november 12 , 2006 . the hood is such that it can block out the sun , no matter from which direction it is shining . and you can still see her face - if you are tall enough . the product is great - if yours if fully functioning . i 'm anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so i can buy another seat . as it is , i try not to take her in the car any more than i have to because of the defective lock since i ca n't spring for another seat now . i will never buy another baby trend for that reason
0	i was very excited to receive the armoire this past weekend . however , after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces . i called strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue . the only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part . the rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks . with the baby coming in within a week or so , who has the time to wait . the product is what you pay for .
0	ditto to other complaints - wo n't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing . cheap , flimsy , leaks water also because no gasket . i 'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by munchki
1	it was nice of my `` ninth month wife '' to agree upon a diaper bag that i was n't too embarrassed to carry . now that the baby 's here , i 've found it to be functional as well as comfortable ; it easily holds enough clothes , diapers and stuff , and does n't feel like you 're carrying an elephant . no complaints at all , it 's a great bag
0	this is a kick piano , not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby 's crib . we thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick , or for her to use her hands on the keys - it is n't . as we use her crib for sleeping , not playing , this has been a total waste of money . at 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands , but the response of the keys is n't instant and the noise is so soft that she does n't recognise that she 's making it work . her sister 's toy xylophone with twice the number of keys , an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use
1	the armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because i was expecting something else . i still like it very much but i wanted a part to hang clothes and it does n't have one . it is very pretty and from the outside it was everything i was expecting ! ! ! thank you
1	i would n't eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a table topper for each of them . the self-sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place , creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre-schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant-table germs . i wish i had thought of these ! ! they 're a great invention for families on the go
1	i got this when my daughter was 4 months old . she would sit in it for about 5 minutes , then want to get out . but now that she is 6 1/2 months , she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself . she has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys , and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth . when we go to family functions or just to someone 's house , we always grab the entertainer . it is very easy to break down and put right back together ( if it does n't fit in the car ) . this by far is the best toy that she enjoys and learns from . she is quite tall for her age , 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this . this is the best $ $ $ $ we have spent so far
1	i have used this system for 9 weeks now . the bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - i test shake before i feed and if its wrong i unscrew and reseat the nipple . my daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the playtex bottles i tried . if your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple . i use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples . i have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and i like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time . these bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily
1	this is a great item . i paid 17.95 for it at walmart though ! get it there
0	i received this after much debate about the prior review . had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer . so i bought it and sure enough had the same problem . amazon was great , they sent me a replacement and still the same problem . my baby is due any day so i am keeping the first one , but sending back the replacement . it doesnt come as described , no blanket included , and i dont see how you could adjust the wedge . i am very disappointed with the product , but happy about amazon 's willingness to assist in the issue .
0	just a note to thank all of the parents who take the time to post their opinions ... i find the `` customer reviews '' a tremendous help when trying to make decisions on `` grandma '' needs ! i also advised my pregnant daughter to check them out before making a final decision on anything ! thanks to all of you again !
1	the only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty . otherwise they work really good . tara boyc
0	save your $ $ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller . on a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side . i did n't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like i thought it was going to either . i would not recommend this product . it 's very cumbersome . when i returned it to the store , there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently .
1	the bib i 've been waiting for . no fuss . no muss . comfortable and easy to clean , the baby bjorn soft bib is a gift from above .
1	i love this car seat stroller . it goes from car to airplane in no time flat . great if you travel with small children with just one adult . also great if running errands and your child falls asleep , no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car . however , the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it . i still love this product .
0	this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector . we even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor . do not but this
0	the tubbly bath dispenser fit our spout just fine , but minutes later it would work itself off . we tried everything to get it to work with no luck . fortunately , the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging . do n't even try it ... it 's not worth it ! look for something else . there are other faucet covers out there
0	in order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy , you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum ( dss ) technology . 900 mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor , though . here 's why : it is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house , that it can not share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 ghz devices . this includes baby monitors and cordless telephones . the correct arrangement should be : baby monitor : 900 mhz digital-spread-spectrum ( dss ) wifi netowrk : 2.4 ghz cordless telephone : 5.8 ghz digital-spread-spectrum ( dss
1	pros : + 900mhz communication for less interference and long range + rechargeable batteries + 10 channel selection + lcd display showing signal strength , battery gauge , channel # + alerts if monitor has different channel then base + visual light indicator for voice cons : + no light on the base bought this model after trying out 49mhz version
1	my daughter loves this activity center . i wish they would change two things about it . i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up
0	i bought this pump because it had the medela name and i thought it was reliable . i was wrong . this is the worst pump in the world . everything the other poster said is true . this is the worst breastpump . i would not recommend this breastpump to anyone
1	i am surprised to read that people do n't like this mirror . we have had it since our son was 1 mon . and we still use it at 7 mon . we have a trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his britax marathon carseat . it has been great for road trips ( our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip ) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store . we do n't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy . we have never had trouble with it being too soft . i have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well . def . recommended .
1	what a great product . no tools , just click , click , click , and it 's ready to use . the anchors keep the unit in place under the mattress . the frame is metal not plastic ! i am very pleased with the quality , and the look . it was out of the box , and on the bed in about 10 minutes . :
0	alas , we have the entire locomotion set but the cute little mobile wo n't fit our sleigh-style crib . i called babies r us to see about some sort of conversion kit , but there 's no such thing . i 'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead . : -
1	any easy to use , lightweight booster carseat . highest scores from consumer reports made it our first choice .
0	i bought this for an older model graco pack n ' play we got from friends who no longer needed it . the mattress measures 27 '' x 39 '' and before washing it my husband and i tried it out to see if it fit . it 's too small . i know it 's supposed to be snug but the mattress wo n't even lay flat with this sheet on it . it seems like it 'd be a great product , if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly .
1	i was given a swaddle me for my third child . she has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks . my oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not . i owe it all to the swaddle me . but at three months she outgrew the small size . i thought she was old enough to go without swaddling , boy was i wrong . it took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size . i have had my large swaddle me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then . thank you swaddle me for helping me keep my sanity
1	my daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and i love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds ! i love the rain ! even i fall asleep listening to it . i had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter . so i block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker : ) i am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i recently purchased this gate , as i needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide . i was so happy when i found this , and for the price ! well , i installed it with no problem at all . but it is not secure . it actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it , the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break . awful and very unsafe ! ! ! target.com was very helpful in sending ups to pick it up .
1	this is great for keeping the sun out of my baby 's eyes- from all angles . and those on window shades always fall off , and are annoying when you want to roll the window down.. this does the job just fine . highly recommend it
1	lots of room for more than i need , easy to carry , cute as a button , lots of compliments from strangers , has held up for 4 months so far with no problems
1	... with both the basic fence 5-piece hearthgate system and a great fit with the decor of our home . highly recommend the entire system . kare
1	i am not wild about the colors and design , but it 's not too bad . the fabric is easy to clean ( machine-washable ) and the sun canopy is great ! with an adapter , i can easily snap it into my bugaboo stroller for ultimate convenience . it 's just a great car seat , although i wish there were cuter girly designs .
1	this item is invaluable in preventing plagiocephaly ( flattening of the head ) ... i wish we had known about it for our twins . newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls . we used it for our third baby and as a result , he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features . the incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap ' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet . gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up . i 've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night . this is true , however , rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a `` u '' shape under our son 's bottom prevented this from happening ever again . as a result , he slept soundly , never spit up once , never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head . i strongly recommend the boppy noggin nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib . also , if your baby is old enough to roll over , this item is not for you . one other note : the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat , so do n't over-swaddle or put too many layers on ... adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature . i would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months . it made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings
1	i have tried just about every diaper rash cream ( desitin , balmex , mustela , vaseline , sprays , gold bond powder , generic brands , etc ... ) , but this is the only brand that truly works . the oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter 's bum in usually one or two changes . best product
1	my 6 month old got these for christmas . they were among the first toys she expressed any interest in . she loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg , but it broke . i emailed baby einstein and asked if i could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite . they are sending a free replacement ! we love baby einstein and our daughter loves these blocks
0	i purchased this item from target and had to return it to the store . the wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam , and the foam is inserted into the cover . the foam is n't the problem , it 's the cover . the zipper goes right down the middle , so it ca n't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck . i would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece . if the zipper were on the side , the product would be great
1	i got four of these sleepsacks , two fleece and two cotton . i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes , but it did n't effect the product . they are wonderful . if you are buying for a newborn , get the 6-12 month size , since it 'll last a bit longer . i ended up giving away the 0-6 month size , when my baby was only 3 months old , as it was getting a bit small .
1	we were downstairs one night watching tv and kept hearing crickets . turns out her bedroom window was open and we were hearing the crickets through the baby monitor . this thing is so good , i can hear crickets in the backyard from one story up . there is no doubt i can hear anything my daughter needs . i can tell from her cry through the monitor whether i need to prep or bottle , get a diaper ready , or its time for play .
0	same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review . they sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set , and will not honor the same price for the bedding set . i have to send it back and they will give a refund . what a hassle
0	my infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds . it is not a well designed blanket
1	my baby has used this since she was 4 months old it has a sturdy wide base..it has height adjusters ... you can recline it..very secure safty belts but i do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when i buckle it thats the only thing i dislike about this highchair . i dont find it hard to clean ..it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it 's on sale ..i paid full price : (
1	we love this seat . it is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs . or at mother inlaws without a highchair . or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair . when traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event . there are so many uses for this great little seat . it is extremely light weight and compact , and comes with a carrying bag
1	there are two types of dekor refill , one regular and one 'plus ' . the sizes are different and you better be sure to order the right one .
0	i was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute , and the concept of having a suction bowl was ( and is ) appealing to me . my son loved the bowl right away , as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers . i 'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them ! however , i 'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds . i 'm constantly pushing the bowl back down , which is disruptive to his meal . despite some of happy memories i 've had with this bowl , i would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls ' they do not serve their purpose
0	i got this potty for my baby shower . i registered for it because it was safety first and most of their products are excellent . i set it out to introduce it to my son ( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet ) . we never actually used it since the top of the seat and i mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it . even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart . instead we bought a plain potty seat by graco and it is excellent !
0	this is a great gate if you have a strong , healthy back and always have two hands available . but how many people with kids have both of those ! it was great at keeping my baby in the room , but my 4 year old could n't open it and neither could her grandma . and it made me and my husband want to cuss . it is back in the box and in the return pile . do n't waste your money .
0	not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position . the wheels have a mind of their own . the handles make it hard to go up curbs . hard to close up , need both hands and foot . but can fit a graco infant car seat , compact fold , and light
1	i bought this dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old . she previously was using a jupiter komfort kruiser xl100 , which i loved . the komfort kruiser was a booster with a back , and although it still fits her to this day , she was eager to move into a backless booster . i think the dakota booster works great . it gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt , but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back . this booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster . the pocket on the side is handy as well , although does not work well with drinks ( i advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest ! )
1	i have no idea how our parents had us with out these ! they are the best invention ! my son likes to play with plates , so i can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating . i have a toddler and a 9 mo old . neither of them have been able to remove these things . and beleive me , they 've tried . so i dont know what that other review was talking about . they 're inexpensive , easy to use , and clean .
0	i could go into a long explanation of how i searched and did tons of research before buying an occasional use pump for myself , who is a stay at home mom . i could explain in detail about everything i did to try and get this pump to work , in the meantime before figuring out the motor was not working , of how i was freaking out my supply was dwindling so i went out to buy fenugreek ... ..but , suffice it to say , the motor lasted me 3 months of once , twice a week useage . it did n't completely die , which is why it took me a while to figure it out , but after paying attention , i could see the vaccum losing more and more power until when i could n't even get a quarter ounce from one side and i was nearly engorged.. ! ! ! at least medela is shipping me out a new motor , this one i hope will at least last longer . especially since my warranty runs out in 2 months ( 6 month total warranty- which to me is too little for a product that costs over $ 100 ! ! ) even though i 'm staying at home and only use the pump occasionally , i wish i 'd just spent the extra $ 150 and gotten a pump in style !
1	before my daughter was born , i knew i was determined to breastfeed her . i read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must-haves were . several people mentioned this nursing stool . i was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be , but i also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly , so i went ahead and bought it . in the weeks prior to my daughter 's birth , my husband assembled the stool and i would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work . after my baby was born , i set up a little nursing station in my living room , and i found the stool to be an essential item . basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position . i also used a nursing pillow , and between the pillow and the stool , the whole experience was actually very comfortable . i was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position . i am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies , and i would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby
1	i am 5'5 with a large bust size and had a 7lbs 7 oz baby . it took a couple times to find the most comfortable way for me to wear it but after that i have had no problems with it . my son will get in there and go straight to sleep and i have never felt he was going to suffocate . the pockets are a major plus and now since it is cold and flu time of the year i like it because all the touchy and coughing people can not touch him with any germs they may have since he is completly covered up . he is still laying down in it so i do n't know how it will work with him sitting up .
0	i bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first . my daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor . it fits beautifully on my graco quattro tour stroller . the big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off , revealing a screw , which scratched my daughters arm . i feel sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments . the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off
0	unless your baby has very long legs , they are not going to be able to push the buttons to spray the water . my son is 1 and can not reach them with his feet in either his convertible seat or the infant seat . however , he is fascinated with it and leans forward to grab at it when i am trying to buckle him into his seat . also , i have had mine about 4 months and the water is evaporated out of it , and i am not finding a way to put new water into it . the floaty things inside get stuck between the plastic after the water has evaporated - and it 's kind of ridiculous to have to bring it in every day to keep it out of the heat
0	i bought the isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time . after using the ones that came with the pump a few times , i did n't like them . they are good in the fridge , but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing . i returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead . they were a little more expensive but well worth it . i love those and highly reccomend them . they also sell just the sealing disc , if you already have plenty of bottles
0	very poor construction and does not `` fit most sleigh cribs '' as advertised on the box . this company should be ashamed of themselves for charging $ 70 for this product . the concept is a good idea and could be so much better , but this company fails in execution . `` tots in mind '' definately has something in mind , however it is not your tots . buyer beware
0	after reading all the rave reviews , we put pupsqueak on our baby 's registry , but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he did n't work . we tried exchanging him for another one at babies r us , but we could n't find one that worked . so instead we exchanged him for the dinosaur ( i forget his name ) . our daughter loves him . since he 's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her . she loves falling asleep holding onto mr. dyno
1	despite some negative reviews i got this seat because i have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging . i also have a textured bathtub bottom so i knew a bathring would not work . well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them . also , whenever i get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub . since using the bath seat my infant has n't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about . and although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there . of course even with this seat you ca n't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - i just put him back and he is happy . even when i do n't bath the two together i put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady ( he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately ) and having my hands free to scrub him . to clean his bottom i just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem . to clean the seat i 've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem . i actually came back here to buy one for my sister but i see that it is n't available right now -boo - i 'll have to find it elsewhere . highly recommend
0	after a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably , i returned it . this is one of the few products i 've had that truly made me ask , `` what were they thinking ? '' the monitor gives off a loud `` out of range '' beep whenever it 's not in good communication , and there 's no way to shut it off . compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it 's out of range even when it 's just in the next room , and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep . but that 's the least of it . the voice-activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit , or not . this is annoying , but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room . and finally , the transmission is absolutely unintelligible : it 's marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound -- speech absolutely can not be understood over this monitor . in short , in no respect is this a functional product
0	after my husband and i put this together using the terrible directions , we 've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months ( not attached to the bed , as some people do ) . my daughter has been sleeping in it just fine . however , we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently . what a nightmare to collapse ! again , the directions are of absolutely no help . it was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up . also , this thing weighs a ton . i now realize i need to buy something else to use when travelling . how annoying . bottom line : if you 're going to set this up and never take it down , it 's fine ( once you initially get it put together , that is ) . however , if you think you 'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home , forget it !
1	my son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this , but my impression is that it is very simple to clean up ( which i love the idea of ) . it seems comfy , he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes :
0	at first i really liked these , until i realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week . it 's not easy to squeeze the air out . since i keep track of how much our baby eats , how can i do that when the liner is all scrunched up ! not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out . i 'm sorry i ever bought them
1	we have 3 of them and have no complaints . i keep one in my car , one in my husbands , and have another for travel . it 's super easy to snap the carrier onto it , and very easy to install in any car . i just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old , and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars . i could use the latch , or just use the seatbelt for older cars . i was worried that i would need my husband 's help with the installation , but i was fine on my own just reading the directions . i recommend this for everyone
0	i bought this for my son thinking that the pee guard would be okay . my son pees over the top of this , plus it being on is n't to comfortable for an adult 's back and having this also makes are toilet seat loose and we have to tighten the screws often . the whole on it is also pretty small
0	why bother with a boppy cover when it does nothing to protect the boppy from spit-ups and poop accidents ? it 's not practical to throw the boppy in the was each time this happens . i can only imagine how stinky this boppy will soon get
1	it 's expensive but worth it . it 's nice to take to work because it looks professional ( many people did n't even know what it was ) and it comes with a cooler so i did n't have to put my milk in the fridge next to everyone 's lunch . a friend also bought one around the same time and says she got it much cheaper on ebay for a brand new one .
0	i liked this tub at first . the size was nice , and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn . after about a month of use , though , there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling . this was after `` squeezing '' it out as best i could and propping it up to dry after every use . the sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold . i stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days . it was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime , especially since it does n't even spray well . the other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press . especially when your hands are wet and slippery . it 's a good thing bru will take back anything ! i am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub
1	we 've had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1/2 year old on his full size `` big boy bed '' . we 're quite satisfied with it . construction : very sturdy , our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way . the mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep . we tug on it from time to time and it 's not going anywhere . assembly : not too easy , the instructions are horrible , but once you realize on your own how it 's supposed to go , the actual assembly is ok , but not quick . very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature . hide away feature : this is what took away the 5th star . it 's not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed . that feature works but requires some wrangling . if you want the hide away feature for once in a while , i would n't let that stop you from buying it , if you plan to hide the rail daily , i do n't recommend it for that . making the bed : easy to tuck the sheets around it , no need to hide away or struggle . overall , i would highly recommend this bed rail , i read all the reviews , and asked many friends , and this seemed to be the best in all areas , and a good value for the price , considering other can be well over $ xx
1	i have yet to use this chair as i am a grandma awaiting the arrival of her first grandchild , but from what i can see , this high chair has everything a larger chair offers but in a lot less space ! it is very sturdy and well put together and i am already recommending it to friends
0	the suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat . they do come in lovely colors , though
1	we have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars . this was the perfect solution because you can place the tie-down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long , so they will fit around large or small bars . we had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with would n't reach , but it was very easy to do . i also like this product because it does n't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision
1	our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old , so in a fit of desperation , i bought this potty , put her on it and never looked back . it helped that the potty was really comfortable , with a wide , flat bottom that left no marks on her tush , and stable enough so there were no accidents . i only give it 4 stars because i really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky . ah , and the music never worked ( no loss in my opinion , i was there to do the encouraging ) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy . a toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting , which may lead to a whole new set of problems . but overall , this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training , that i can not but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic
0	i love my medela pump in style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful . the twist-tie closure is complicated . they also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing . i recommend the lansinoh bags . they have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it 's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing . you can also lay them flat to freeze so they wo n't take up much space in the freezer . they pour great - no spills !
1	when i first bought this , over a year ago , i was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands . rest assured , this is all you will need ! my finicky baby had to have his warm alimentum . this bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy , i could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer ( that comes with ) poor it in and left it alone . it was ready within a minute and after a few shakes , it was the perfect temperature . this is also helpful for warming up baby food jars ( comes with a special attachment just for that purpose ) the warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating ! outside is easy to clean ( the water deposits on the warmer - not so much ) all in all it did the job for my little boy . and for $ 16 get it ! and get one for the grandparents ! do n't spend $ 30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing
1	my son was 20 lbs at 6 mos. , so we had to stop using front carriers : ( i bought the combi as well as this one and this one is much more user friendly ( so easy to get on and off by yourself ) and much more comfortable . i 've read reviewers saying it 's uncomfortable ... well if you have a big baby ... it 's just going to be uncomfortable ! they 're heavy ! but this is the best one it 's nice to give your arms a break ! the neck strap is well padded and easy to switch from one side to the other ( for relief ) w/o taking the baby out . it 's compact enough to keep with you . and if you 're baby just needs to be close to you or held sometimes ... it 's a must have ! we took a trip last week and it was priceless ! one tip : read the instruction manual and you will enjoy this product a ton more
1	this is a great walker . the tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger . my grandson just loves the walker and i do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely . amazon sells model # 14570 , so do n't worry , the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary . also , a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk
1	i bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer , and he 's used it once and tried to go in it several times , but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it . i have one bathroom , and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat . this has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises . i do have to check the collection reservoir a lot , though , because my older son does `` go '' a lot , as big boys will . the flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty . plus , the pee collects in a part of the potty the child does n't have easy access to , unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in , then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second ( i speak from experience ) . makes it much more sanitary . the only problems i 've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly ( mostly when it was new ) , simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes , the fact that my three-year-old still ca n't quite get it that he ca n't sit on it and do # 2 , and the fact that it 's just a little off-balance , so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall , you could have an icky mess . luckily , ours has only fallen over when filled with water
1	i like this product . it is very stylish and lightweight . definitely , i highly recommend to anyone
0	this is a very cute bouncer chair . however , i feel it was poorly designed . it sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys . in addition , our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far . we had to find one that set more upright
0	this is o.k . if you 're using it as a restraint only . if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart , forget it . i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars , wrong . it hardly covers anything . i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything , i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat
0	the good thing is that , except for the spring , the jumper is pretty nice . unfortunately , the spring is the most important part and it is not good . it has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it . we gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl
0	i thought tiny love products were good , so i bought this . the first one i received had the water leaking out . the second one does n't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying . my baby seems to like it , but it does not live up to what it advertises
1	a friend recommened that i try her sling for my colicky baby . our dear daughter suffered with severe gerd and would cry for hours . as soon as i placed her in the sling she would immediately relax . it was like magic and truly kept me sane . after doing some reading i found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us . our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously . when we go on trips i always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller . she loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile . i recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it . bought another new native and am thrilled . one of the absolute best purchases that i have made as far as baby gear goes .
1	my 3 1/2 year old son finally graduated into his `` big boy bed '' with our move into our first house . that meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib . we opted for the sure position n lock bedrail . i gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does lock into its position and stay there . the weird thing about it , however , is that the pressure bars `` pop ! '' . you 'll get the rail in place on the bed , push down on the pressure bars so that they show 'green ' to indicate they 're locked ... then after a while they 'll go `` pop ! '' and begin to inch their way up into the 'red zone ' , meaning `` unlocked '' . it 's weird ! it does n't seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed , but it 's a loud noise that , until he was used to it , would wake him out of a dead sleep . all in all , i do recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds . it 's been a great source of safety and roll-out-of-bed prevention and it 's given my husband and me much peace of mind at night
0	these bottle leak , they 're expensive ... and you ca n't mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over ! do n't waist you 're money - they 're a pain to wash , too many pieces , and they just plain leak . after 9 months of using them i 'm ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else . plus , even with the top on , if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything
0	after only 2 months this toy fell apart . my daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail 's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams . $ 20 is not cheap for this toy and i think the quality should have been alot better
0	if your baby has fingers or teeth this is not a trap . they can easily take the lid off and scatter snacks about with glee .
0	my son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long ... he wasnt the tiniest baby ... i tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he 's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing ... it 's the worst product ever , i am definitely not using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..
0	i love this swing because it goes side to side , she can sit when awake , lay down when asleep , and once you put her in she is out cold . after 6 weeks of using it i thought the battery was going , but when i changed the battery the music was still slow and i still had to keep the swinging motion on high , two weeks later it just stopped working . i 've only had it for two months and hardly use it , just a total of 3 hours a day give or take a few
0	i have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing . child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her . i will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck
0	well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem , cause i mean when you buy it , you already know that ! lol my daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not . every time i would put it on her , she would scream and beg me not to put it on . it was really heartbreaking . on the plus side , this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me lol we used it a couple of time and put it aside . she really hated it and i felt that it caused more tention than it is worth
0	we have n't yet put the bed together so it might be great but i gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it did n't ! this was a common complaint in reviews . two of the main pieces were seriously scratched or chipped . it did was definitely not damaged in shipping because it was packed well . there is a phone number to call if parts are damaged . we 'll do that soon . i 'll update this review if everything is fixed
1	i like the fact that kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets ( i have two , one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry ) . they wash extremely well ( still looks new ) , are soft and fit the mattress appropriately . however , i think $ 16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice . ( amy coe , sage green at target for $ 8.99 and koala baby sage green for $ 9.99 at bru ) . since you need several crib sheets , i just do n't feel the price is worth it for this one .
0	this bra is very comfortable once on . getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head . it rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body . as far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed , which with a baby is all you usually have to work with . the star rating is only for comfort , 0 stars for function
0	the one star is for the bag it comes in . you can take these things along with you ... but honestly , how many of these things will you really need ? maybe just two of them , the nail clippers and the bulb syringe ... i have the set , given to me as a gift . i say , just buy these things separately , it 's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you ... it 's more practical than buying this whole set..
0	this wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move . we use cloth wipes it has burned a few , smells moldy no matter what i have done to clean it ( never happened with any of our other wipes warmers ) wo n't stay closed . it actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser ' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it . then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table . get a different warmer this one is awful
1	play table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson ( 18 months ) loves it . it is good for small children - better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over . i wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely
1	it is a very nice product , soft and easy . but it was an ideal for my daughter 's neck . she has neck rash and the plastic ring around the neck was not a good ideal for her
1	i recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie . she loves the lights , the rotating stuffed animals , and the sounds . and she seems comfortable in the seat too . the seat snaps into two positions , a reclined position and a sitting position . additionally , you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward . i did have an incident last week where we had some power surges here in the neighborhood while we were using this swing . when the power came back on , i tried all the different switches to turn it on and it did n't work , then later on , it finally did work . this swing has so many switches on it and i admit to being too lazy to read the instructions for all of the functions that each of the switches perform . that said , i do n't know if the failure was user error or a quality issue . it appears to be functioning just fine as of this writing so i think it was me . another user cites instability of the stand on this swing . i have had no problem with this as i tested it carefully before putting baby in . also , we leave the swing set up in one place in our house all the time , so we have n't had have to worry about not opening the stand up all the way beyond the initial setup . this might be more of a concern for someone who needs to put it away and take it back out a lot . i personally like the fact that the mobile , the rocking , and the sounds are independent of each other , so you have a lot of variety to entertain baby with . i love the fact that you can use batteries or the wall outlet to power this thing . thank goodness for not being held hostage to battery manufacturers anymore , but having that option if we wanted to use it where electricity is n't available . i would recommend this swing , but i would check for a reasonable return policy first before buying and keep the packaging for a couple of weeks after you receive it just to be sure you and your baby are happy with it
0	i am returning my roxy safe seat ! it was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door ... .the material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat . at a grocery store , the seat just fits into the whole cart and i have no room for groceries . its not worth the hastle . i admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy . the seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place . sorry graco , the idea was good but the carseat is awfull
1	i got one of these for my baby shower i loved it so much i went back and bought another one . very easy to use . i just put my baby in it before she 's going to sleep for the night . there is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack . puts your mind at ease , no loose blankets in the crib ! ! also , reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights
1	i love that it sticks and does n't slide . it is great for my 21 month old to feel part of the family when we eat
1	seemed like a great system . i came with two universal clips so you can use two of the holders at once . if you want to use more then you have to remove one attachment . it does not fit my aria twin stroller because the aria does not have any tubing anywhere available once you close it up ( and not much available once it 's open .
1	i bought the same brand , but maybe an newer/older version of this ? it did n't have the book or the decogestant that is only for the older children that others have mentioned . however , it did have an infant tylenol equivelent , which we have been lucky enough to not have had to try yet . the gas drops are fantastic - thank goodness we had these , especially when we had to change his formula ! ! anytime our son was `` fussy for no reason '' we tried these drops first and it stopped the fussiness almost every time . the saline drops are great and the nose drops have really helped during his colds . the aspirator works fine , i 've never tried a different one , so ca n't compare . he did n't care about the teething toy , and does n't care for the taste of the teething gel , but it seems to work . it also has two cooling wipes which we have n't had to use ( no fevers yet ! ) . overall i was really glad to have this , and to have all these things together in a nice case i slid right under his changing table - no need to hunt for things in the middle of the night . i 'd recommend this to all new moms
0	i have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly . the two main parts , left side board and right side board , both came in totally cracked . when i called in to order replacements , the customer service rep knew exactly what i 'm calling to re-order . ? ! ? ! ? ! if it 's a known problem , why not fix it ? ! the customer service reps are very nice , but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really does n't make this product very attractive . the processing itself takes 2-3 weeks . in my case , 3 weeks later , i found out that my 2 parts are on back-order , awaiting shipment by container from brazil . so it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until i receive it . i hope the dresser arrives before the baby ...
0	i swear -this is the crime ! the worst product in the western hemisphere . never , never buy this piece of garbage
1	like any parent , i was concerned about sids so the sleepsack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets . little did i know , i would come to love the sleepsack for it 's warming capabilities . after a few months under their belt , babies get very squirmy in the middle of the night , so blankets are useless ( and dangerous ) . so i relied heavily on the sleepsacks to keep my little guy warm , even after the risk of sids passed . they come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months , and they 're generous in size , so they are not outgrown easily . i only wish i 'd purchased them in yellow or white , in case my next baby is the opposite sex
1	we had an old wooden cradle for the newborn . the snuggle nest made it snuggly , warm and comfy . however , it did n't work in our bed ( queen size ) because it was big and bulky . if you plan on using it in your bed buy `` inclined to sleep '' with positioners . babies'r'us sells it now . it 's easier to move the sleeping baby from and to your bed when in inclined to sleep .
1	i like this sheet so much better than the thin ones . it offers more padding and seems so much more comfy ! it is a tight fit , but i had no problem fitting the sheet onto my eddie bauer pack n play . so , i would assume it should fit any pack n play . just make sure to wash in cold water , and hang dry . i never put this in the dryer . the only thing i do n't like is the color . it happens to match my navy blue playard , but i wish it came in some lighter colors
0	these are a complete waste of money . the nipples flow too fast for a newborn . i tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding . she also swallowed so much air-i was burping her for what seemed hours . the bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $ 3.99 ... personally i like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer , they take up less space
1	this is my second superyard . the first one i bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers . aside from being a little stiff to fold ( which might be because it is new ) this model is a vast improvment over the old . it 's a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier . great for blocking off the christmas tree or any other part of the house . cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby . during football season , my friends and i take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard , so all the toddlers can safely play together . it 's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors . minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler . do i really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision ? final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment i 've ever owned . the only reason i gave it 4 stars insteat of 5 is because my experiences with north states ' customer service has been poor
1	this is a very useful item . it looks great and holds a lot of stuff . you can also carry it around from room to room
1	this is the third potty i 've purchased for my son . the first one was made by parents , and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it . the second was first years elmo 3-in-1 , and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts . this one is great . although my son was hesitant to go on it at first ( which i attribute to his experience with the elmo potty ) , he fits nicely on it . the other potties were too narrow from front to back , and i had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard . the seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom ; and easy clean up . it 's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too . the back and arm supports fit well also . it 's a solid construction and good buy .
1	i wish i would have bought this bouncer when i first found it . my son was heavier and quickly outgrew his other bouncer . this one holds up to 40 pounds . i did n't buy it right away as it was a bit pricey for me . so i tried to get it on ebay but was always outbid at the last minute . then i realized that if those people could get $ 35+ ; then i could too when i was done with it . so i finally ordered it when my son was 6 months old and 19 pounds . he loves it . i love it . it 's made very well . if i had bought it when i first found it i would have gotten 4 more months of use out of it . so do n't hesitate . you wo n't be sorry .
0	i will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed ! they need to repackage items like this for shipping . it it the second and the last item of this type i will order online . the other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed . i have complained before but never get a response ... too bad too as i like amazon
0	it worked great for a few days , then as i got to the bottom of the batch of wipes , they were totally dry . also , the whole thing flooded my changing table , not sure why , but i am returning this unit
0	i am so disappointed by another avent product that is just no good . short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak . my son 's cups have leaked on him , on the floor , in his diaper bag and in the car . i do n't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star . mom 's have enough too do -- -running around cleaning after leaky , unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the avent magic cup .
1	i 'm a mother of a 21-month-old . i just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller and the leash on our walks . this backpack is perfect . it fits me well and my daughter loves it . she asks to stay in it when we 're done ! i was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers i 've tried before when she was younger . you do have to toughen up your shoulders ( by taking shorter walks at first ) before going on any long hikes , of course . i do n't understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews , because the chest strap is adjustable , long , and sits just below the shoulders , avoiding the `` busty '' area very well . however , it does come out of the box at the shortest setting , so you have to loosen it to fit your frame . the question of being able to `` close '' the frame with the child in it does n't seem to be an issue on mine . the stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back . you do need long enough arms to grab it behind you , though . it makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk , but if you 're in tight quarters , you 'll want to close it . i did make the mistake of trying to put aeryn 's ( my daughter 's ) feet behind me in the frame at first , which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame . the legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist . ( the picture on the box helped me figure that out . ) it is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months , and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield . the rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions- my daughter thinks it 's cool and leans over to fog it with her breath . it 's not easy to do with a six-month-old puppy jumping around on you , but i 've even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with aeryn in the pack ( i 'm reasonably fit , and she 's just under 30 pounds ) . this thing is rugged , comfortable , good-looking , and has `` be prepared '' features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack ( that can be carried on the frame , if you 'd rather )
0	i thought these would be great specially for the $ but i was soo wrong ! ! i 've only washed them once , to have everything clean b/f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls ! ! the fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls , way to many to even remove by hand- and on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam ! ! ! it looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand-me-down after one wash ! ! do not waste your time or money ! !
0	i had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub . i would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off . i ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad , but then it became just an expensive knee stool . the knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why i give it 2 stars rather than 1 . i returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price
1	i absolutely recommend this infant seat ! my son is almost 1 now and i am still using this seat . it is fabulous for it 's fabric options of colors and most importantly for it 's roominess . my son is on the chunky side , being an exclusively breastfed baby . he is still quite comfortable in this seat and i love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool . the travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and i am always stopped by people saying.. '' what a ride ! '' . well it is , quite a ride . if you buy this car seat , it will last you for the entire first year of your baby 's life . thank you graco
1	i have always had graco infant seats for my children . i got this one for baby number 4 and love it . it is so cute ! and the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months . also , i love the color of it .
1	i am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms-to-be , i read pretty much all of the reviews on every item i need to register for or buy for baby . however , the helpful hint i have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer . he said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up ( heat all of the wipes ) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes ... .they are dried out from being continuously reheated . they basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first . we opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller ( more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of ) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change . some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have ( after all , babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented ) , but because our baby will be born during the winter , i thought this would have more use for us . i gave this product four stars because we have n't tried it yet ... .but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process
1	this is absolutely the best bottle on the market . after working in daycare and as a nanny , i had a preference for these . then after my sister had my nephew and used them i knew the minute i found out i was expecting that i would be using them too . the reason that i love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto . most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large , more like a breast . if you think about how a woman 's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what i mean . being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up . i also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot . because they use the liner , the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3am ! ! ! some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying . but not really . 100 eight ounce liners will cost about $ 8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks . so not as bad as you might think . ( if this is truly an issue for you , consider the advent bottles . they also have relatively large nipples . but because they do not use a liner , you can not eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up . )
0	we received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes ... that is ... until i lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom . upon further inspection i noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though i had filled it up at least once a day . it seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom . originally i had thought that perhaps i had a defective model , but after searching online , i noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had , and now have decided to buy a different brand . i did keep the water filled , and still had a poor experience . save your money and invest in a different brand
0	i absolutely agree with this review : `` you will not get your moneys worth ... , february 26 , 2006 '' we bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours . we have the sable color , which i see is not sold this year ... but i digress . we have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it . my biggest complaint is the steering . the front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we 're not on a smooth surface , it feels like i am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they do n't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards . i am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so i can get where i want to go . shopping is a joke with this stroller because i can not get it to navigate the aisles easily . the shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which , really , does n't seem like the best way to keep a child 's shoulders restrained . it ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt . this is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger , this got on my nerves . the adult cup holder is a joke , so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid 's cupholder out so it does n't stay in any longer as well . oh , and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on . so frustrating ! not a big deal , really , but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time . i just remembered also , that the sides of the padding in the seat area , when i used this stroller with our graco snugride car seat , would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely . i would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area ( the parts that say aria ) before i put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly . if peg perego could fix the steering , i think i would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that i found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son
1	this is the single best new baby item that i purchased ! ! i was a mom who swore that `` my baby will never sleep in my bed '' . needless to say that did n't last 3 nights . i got this co sleeper and it was just perfect . felt much more secure with him in there . very portable too , i took it everywhere for the first three months
1	our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier , and we needed a `` big girl '' car seat immediately . i knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures . after reading reviews and checking out the roundabout , marathon and boulevard seats in the store , we decided on the boulevard . i love the added protection the side-impact wings provide . true , it is just about the most expensive car seat out there , but i believe it is well worth the price . the only drawback was that i found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing . i finally settled on brownstone because i believe it to be the least dreadful of them all . i was surprised to find that it is not as bad as i had imagined . it is extremely soft ( almost has a chenille-like feel ) and does not get too hot ( even in direct sunlight ) . there is also the option of ordering different covers , if i tire of this one . this car seat is pretty big , but it fits just fine in our honda accord ( in the middle of the back seat ) , and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side . it was very easy to install using the latch system . i have not had any problems or complaints . my daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat , and i feel safe with her in it
0	we got 2 of these and had the same problem with both . the cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package . after washing it as directed , it has gotten even worse . it has strings hanging all over it . it 's a very useful item , but the quality of the fabric is terrible ! a friend of mine had the same problem , and she recommends the especially for baby brand ( less expensive and better quality )
1	i love this stroller , and tell all of my friends about it . our daughter was about 3 months old when i purchased it . there was not a better rated stroller available when i researched , and there still is not . you can run , walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe . lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks , and occasional rollerblading . she is a fussy girl , ( only ) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat , but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of bob . we live in florida , and with the sun-guard canopy , she is well covered . some other factors which made we chose bob : * the braking mechanism , which is hard to find , has a wrist strap which if you should fall , locks the back wheels ( unlike most strollers on the market ) . this feature is great for rollerbladers . * 5 point safety harness * 70 pound weight limit ( highest that i found ) * metal frame ( others have more plastic that metal ) * shock absorbers , great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep * swivel front wheel , which locks with a simple pin . * simple lily likes it , and we tried several others , all that babies-r-us has in stock . the cost is pretty high , but would you put a price on the safety of your child , if you were to fall while exercising ? thanks for hearing me out
1	this is the best carseat out there . it 's above the peg perego and britax . it weighs only 8 pounds so it does n't break your arm and it is so easy to adjust . the best feature is the base is designed so that it does not move in the car . i 've had graco infant seats that completely flipped sideways when i made turns because they just were n't secure even with the special belt clip . the only down side is the canopy is a bit floppy but it still does it 's job . 5 stars ! ! !
1	great product ! it makes your life a lot easier , not having to worry about boiling your bottles . please keep in mind that it is a `` sterilizer '' , not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer . somehow , a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does
0	at first loved it because the travel system , with stroller , is so light and does n't look doudy like other systems . but : the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car . the straps never tangled , but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed . the carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands , a button on each , that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle . difficult to perform when you 're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby . yes it is a trendy color with the gray , but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe ! it is horribly hot for the baby . still love the stroller by combi , but i never recommend the car seat to anyone . luckily , time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway .
0	i started using these for cloth diapering with my first child . they hold plenty and have held up pretty well . the ones i hav n't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years ! these are n't as great as chinese prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper , trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail . these are the best diapers sold in stores
1	i heard about these blankets from a co-worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter . they are the softest blankets i 've ever felt . there 's a reason this company 's name is cloudb ! the only reason i gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing - the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges . not a big deal , i just snipped them with a scissors , but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished .
0	i had a winter baby and i ca n't begin to imagine what i would have done without this item . i have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well . the absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child . and what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself . i was excited that right before i had my baby girl they came out with the new limited version . i have the diva color for my little and i get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use . i disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made . i installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time . the material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric . i would consider this a must for any first-time moms ( as i was ) on their registry . the price definitely a lot higher than i would like to see it , but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase .
1	these stickers are great . my toddler has a small white table that about every 3 months we decorate with new stuff . this quarter its `` cars '' he loves them . they are very durable , vibrant and colorful . highly recommended
0	i agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately . i always follow the measuring instructions , but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot , even though i have been practicing to get it right . i wish it were more accurate and for someone like me , who only has a 3 room apartment , the cooling feature is not that useful
0	i was very disppointed in this product . i found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer , but this was the only good quality . i had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching . you could smell the plastic in the milk . i 'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals , especially when her liver is n't developed enough to fully detoxify them . i really wanted to love this product , but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option
0	my baby got this for christmas . he was about 7 months old . now , a couple months later , he still does n't play with it . my 3-year old does n't play with it either and he loves most of our other `` baby '' toys . this toy is just not that interesting . i wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all
0	sometimes it works ok . sometimes it stops swinging for no reason . sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music . it always makes a gringing noise when swinging . if it worked like it should it would be a great product . i like the stars projected below- when they work
0	we just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by safety 1st and parents . this cover lasted about one minute . seriously ! by the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors , my son had opened the first one my husband had installed . the tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open .
0	the crib tent did not fit our crib . it 's not deep enough or long enough . i called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned . i am very disatisfied with this company and the product .
0	the design is pretty narrow . my 3-4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described . the product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry . unless you have a very small and quiet baby , otherwise it is not a wise choice
1	granted , it may not work for every single baby ( haha ) but i know a ton of women who swear by this blanket . it is the gift i give at every shower . do n't second guess yourself about whether or not to get this brand over a less-expensive one - you wo n't regret it
1	when we first got the stroller , it pulled to the left significantly , but we got on the phone with tike tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating . the stoller works great now . i have taken it running with my two girls - it is very stable and drives smoothly
0	both my children get thrush very easy so i purchased this product to sterilize the bottles and nipples with every use . my kids still get thrush and this product is terribly messy and the bottle look horrible afterwards . if my kids keep getting thrush , obviously this product does not work
0	we received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery . it worked the first time , but never again ! i repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working , it just would not turn on ! ! ! ! ! i asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period . i then sent a email to the first years explaining the situation and never received a reply . lousy product !
1	i love this bottle drying rack . it does n't take up a lot of space and looks and workds great
1	i purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib . i was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots . so in figuring this would also be good for travel , i bought it . my son loves it ! the whole thing is like a mesh beach chair . i put it together in about 8 seconds . the removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft . the entire thing is easy to wipe clean . it looks comfy . it says it is good for kids up to 75lbs . and 52 inches . ( good to know ) my favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots . not nearly as bulky , too ! nice royal blue colors
1	the gate works perfectly . however , it does n't get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive . i am very handy with tools , remodeling , etc . and i found the installation to take longer than i would have expected . the latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top . there was a `` u '' stamped in it , but no mention of that in the instructions . nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom . how hard would that be ? one sentence ? i went through a dry run and figured it all out , but it doubled the installation time ( took +/- 1 hour )
1	i was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub . she loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills . the only down side is that the crayons get a bit `` mushy '' after a bit of time in the water . but it the baby einstein crayons are a good replacement ... which are inexpensive as well . i look forward to many `` van gogh '' s from her .
0	okay were to start . this car seat looks good on paper but that is it . when it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.if you have the latch system in your car you must find , and shove all the belts inside the seat . then pull them out the correct places . not so easy . then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached , slide it back . this is very hard . so once there together it is a pain to take apart . for facing backwards , if the seat is not level with your car seats , use a towel or blanket . you should n't have to do that . plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat . once you turn it forward , to get the belts adjusted , you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you . this would work fine if the base was n't holding them so you ca n't move them . we took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts . what is the point of that . once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it 's purpose but i highly suggest buying something of better quality .
1	i have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it ! it could be used for a girl or boy . i have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything i liked and they seemed high in price , well then i found this one and it 's fits perfect on a portable crib . and it 's alot cuter than the picture ! i really do like it . the only thing is i wish it had a dust ruffel :
0	this product was terrible . first and foremost this seat did not fit on american airlines business class seats ! secondly , the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt . the wheel covers fell off the first time i used it . the stroller is a piece of junk . when i called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back , so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match . do not buy
0	this seemed like a great idea but it does n't work very well for cloth diaper users , like me . i use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs . however , since my cloth diapers wo n't fit into the diaper organizer , i 'm not sure what to put there . because of this , there is a lot of wasted space . i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers
0	this wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight . the screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks . the rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom . i have another wipe warmer by dex that does n't seem to dry out the wipes and i have never seen rust
0	the quality of this swaddle blanket is very good , i 'm not complaining about that . the problem we 've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks . this triggers his newborn rooting instinct , which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on . instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger . i recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item . we own two of them , and they keep our baby very cozy and warm
1	it works great for me . i have 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats and before i did n't know what going on in my house . now i can hear any sound - guests coming , kids playing/watching tv and even when cats jump on dining table to steel some food . it makes some fone sound on max volume , but i do n't care - i just reduse volume or change unit position . i strongly recomend this monitor
0	i used to have a graco metrolite stroller , and i really liked it . however , i gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system . i bought a used jeep liberty stroller , thinking it would be an upgrade , and boy was i wrong . i will simply list the things i do not like : 1 ) it is quite bulky when folded , especially compared to other strollers i 've had . 2 ) it is heavy , awkward to carry , and there 's nowhere apparent to grab it . handles ? i do n't see any . 3 ) all 3 tires went flat . my local bike shop charged about $ 30 to replace them all ( your mileage may vary ) . 4 ) my daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded , the sounds did n't work so i ca n't comment on those . 5 ) it creaks when you push it . i 'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks . 6 ) the mp3 player , which is the `` cool factor '' and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller , has these small speakers near the baby 's head , so in order to really hear the music if you 're playing music you like , you have to turn it up . and the volume does n't go very high . for the same money , you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller .
0	this monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our tokyo apartment . although the monitor is sensitive and clear , moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal
1	we loved the wedge for our little boy . he slept on it until he outgrew it . it really helped him breathe better when he had a stuffy nose
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months , and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere . also , the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out ... wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up , but i 'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !
0	this is my first amazon review b/c i feel this is such junk i had to review it and epinions didnt have it listed . usually i can find something to do with a junky product , but this is so junky i ca n't do anything with it , i might as well have just washed the money down the drain . the fabric is rough , too rough for a new baby , the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable . as a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it , once filled it sinks . how can it support a baby if baby ca n't touch it or it sinks . you have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b/c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger , the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break . not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later . i have 4 kids and have tried a lot of tubs , seats and supports for the tub , some i disliked but none even come close to the uselessness of thi
0	we did read the directions and the product still works sporadically . my wife is a physician ! the leaking problem is incredibly frustrating , especially when the baby is crying . buy anything else - you will be very disappointed , especially at this price point
1	diaper dekor is the small , plus is the larger . there are two sizes -- + wo n't fit the smaller unit . we have the smaller and our babies r us ( which is where we bought it ) says `` oh sorry , we only carry the big ones now . '' nice ! now we have to buy liners online . i do n't mind buying online but i do n't appreciate that i ca n't go buy them where i bought the unit . if i 'd had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we 'd have bought + . it 's excellent
0	i purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house . though i am very sorry i purchased it . when you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal ( with the foot part of the swing much higher than the head position ? ? ) very weird ? ? while it swings , i am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor . also , there is no head support . on the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- this is not the case . my daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is no head support with this swing . my daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it does n't seem to have the support that other swings have . i have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is much better . to add- the mobile is horrible . it 's really pitiful and hard to believe that fisher price put something like that on the market . the entire swing has a poor design to it .
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old . my husband enjoyed them more at first , but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old , so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier . at 10 months , he still enjoys playing with them . they have lasted through `` both '' children . i would highly recommend these blocks for infants , and so far even into the toddler age , he enjoys playing with them
1	this monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night . i test it frequently and it works . there has never been a false alarm ( everyone warned me i would lose my mind if it went off by accident , it has n't ) . the only drawback , the channel is not so clear , there is static when you listen to it , but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny . ( i have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when i just want to monitor noise during the day , but i would not have another monitor for his bedroom .
1	this seat is wonderful . my daughter ca n't quite sit on her own yet , but this keeps her secure and comfortable . make sure you loop the belt around your child and the cart or high chair . this seat is small and very easy to use ; it 's a great product
0	i did n't even get to use this pad . it fell apart in the washer the first time i washed it . the vinyl in the back ripped to shreds on the delicate cycle ? ? ? ? ? ? what 's up with that ? what good is it to have a mattress pad that you ca n't wash ? total waste of money - i am taking it back today ! !
0	alas , we have the entire locomotion set but the cute little mobile wo n't fit our sleigh-style crib . i called babies r us to see about some sort of conversion kit , but there 's no such thing . i 'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead . : -
0	i have had nothing but problems with this company . i was missing bolts for an item . i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me . they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty . took care of that , but still waiting on bolts . order the piece in december , it is now april and still not able to assemble
0	i bought the baby einstein sea crib toy based on its look . i brought it home , put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds . i was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds . i had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music . i took it back and purchased the fisher price aquarium and it is great . it plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable
1	i received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised . i put it together , all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins , and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it . i have the chicco key-fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place , my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon . there is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that it 's a bit heavy/bulky , i hope i do n't have any problems getting it in and out of my van . i ca n't wait to try it out at the mall
1	i was very pleased when i saw just how beautiful this car seat was . now that my daughter is 3 months old i feel i can give it a review . i read many things about complaints but i just do n't have any . everything works well on it . it does n't fit well in all carts but carts were n't made for baby carriers to fit in them so it 's not a bad thing about the car seat itself . all infant carriers will have the same problem . i recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks . it 's pretty and fits great in it 's stroller . all in all , it 's a great buy . although my next time around , i 'm passing up the infant carrier and going britax . they 're much safer imo from what i 've read and heard
1	this is a great product . it takes a little practice to get the right amount of water . disposables take much less b/c they tend to trap the steam , etc . i do n't see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true . sure it boils the water - it has to make steam ! but why would you reach inside there ? there is no reason i can think of why you 'd ever need to do that . and with the first 2 children we used this on , i 've never had a bottle even become remotely stuck , snug , you name it - not even close - so do n't worry about it . i 've used avent 4oz and 9oz bottles as well as playtex disposable bag bottles . it 's not really a good use of money if you 're just using formula - just make it with warm water . but if you 're nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night , this is a must have ...
1	the diaper dekor is the best diaper pail on the market ! it 's easy to operate and stays odor-free ! to get rid of a dirty diaper , just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail . completely hands-free ! you do n't have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the diaper genie . when the pail is full , just pull out the bag , cut it loose on the door-mounted blade , and tie a knot in the top . then , just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you 're all set for the next batch of dirty diapers ! the `` continuous liner '' concept is genius ! i 've been using the diaper dekor since my daughter 's birth ... and i 'm still on the same refill that came with the pail . i did , however , stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry ! : -
1	my sister who has 4 kids insisted i buy this and boy was she right ! those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off are n't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet . first of all , the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that 's a pain to tie on and off . especially when you get it on there just right . then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners . did i mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion ? ugh , i do n't think so . i 'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have my daughter sit on a soaking sheet ( this pad wicks away the moisutre ) and have to go through so much trouble to change it . as far as the `` imprint '' on her face , i have n't noticed any and she has n't been bothered
1	this is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there . the colors are fabulous , the material is soft and nice , and i was so pleased by its overall quality . we also purchased some of the extras , ( the lamp , pillow , and wall hangings ) and were just as pleased . i would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that does n't wish to know the gender before it 's born , but also any parent that does know , be assured , it is great for a girl or boy , especially if you like animals ! !
1	i ordered this potty chair after seeing the others all had some negative aspects . this seat is perfect ! my almost 2.5 year old daughter took to it immediately . it 's not too small ( she 's very tall ) but not too big ( she has a petite bottom ) . it cleans up easily , and is not so lightweight or small that it becomes a toy for her . the seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet , and has handles for the child to steady him/herself . the bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning . there are also handles on the base that overlap with the handles on the seat so you can easily pick it up and move it . the lid closes `` just like mommy 's potty '' and becomes a wide flat step stool . perfect product
1	this is our first and only child seat and has worked quite well for us . we do need to put in a specialized cushon for our baby 's head . there have been recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep in a child seat and sine babies ' head muscles are n't very strong , the support is a good addition . i find the triangle grip excellent but even with a small baby in the seat , you will not want to cary this very far at all . my wife in fact had a back injury carying our son in this seat and that was just from the car to our house ! some day , these seats may come with some other innovation making them more ergonomic for parents . i do n't know that it would have been different in another seat , but be warned , these things are not meant to actually carry a child by hand and women have weakened muscles after giving birth . it 's a terrible combination . carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as i found out too late . back to the seat , it works quite well in the car and with the baby trend snap-n-go . we use the snap-n-go quite often and it prevents you from repeatedly removing your child from the seat and snapping him back in ( which can be trying for you and your kid ) . i was disappointed the unit had no spf rating for the sun shade . that feature may not have made it to child seats but sun protection is extremely important for babies and it would n't be difficult to use a protective fabric . i called baby trend and they had no idea if and how well the shade actually blocked harmful uv rays . other seats may not have this feature either but we will look closely for it in the future after being sternly warned by the child safety class at the hospital . babies have super sensitive skin and it 's important to avoid any direct sunlight if possible . i know it sounds extreme and alarmist but it also should be very easy to do and is recommended by the american adadamy of pediatrics ( [ ... ] ) . for now , you would need an additional cover on top of the included cover . pros : consumer report top pick , not as expensive as some cons : no spf rating or sun uv protection listed for sun shade . heavy and non ergonimic to cary by hand ( not a complaint specific to this particular seat , they probably all are )
1	we heat our home with a coal stove , so when it comes time to put the baby down i worry that the room might become too cold . with this monitor i can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room . the humidity level comes in handy during cold season , i 've found . the night light on this monitor is great , it 's very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether . i 've not owned it very long , so i ca n't comment on durability yet , but so far so good . my [ .. ] has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it 's still fine . i would definitely recommend this monitor , thank god the price was right too
1	this was a gift and in shopping for a pack-n-play , it seemed the best value for the price
1	i do n't know what one of the reviewies was talking about.. if you read the manual , you will learn that you need to move the `` leg '' on the front so that the seat sits level . that will keep your childs ' head from falling forward . if that fails , go to burlington coat factory and get a wedge , to prop it up more.. ( to most moms i know this has been common purchase ) i think that it is a very nice and well built car seat.. i do agree that it would be nice to have the seat belt tabs so that you do n't need the base.. but getting an extra base is n't a bad ideal , anyways.. remember you should always have your local police department check your seats , before your child rides in it.. this is usualy a free service.. and is often held at a local babies r u
1	this is one of the best products i have seen for the car seat . i am very particular about my car and did not want the leather to get messed up . this product is the best and will prevent items from spilling onto the sea
1	i got this product b/c when we first put our daughter in the highchair when we went out to eat she immediately wanted to touch the table . i was fine with it until i wiped the table off and was disgusted at what i saw . the tables at most restaruants are n't always cleaned with clean rags . now , as she 's older and eating some puffs and other finger foods , it 's great b/c i can put the food directly on her mat and the cup catches the leftovers ! i keep ours in a large ziploc bag in my diaper bag so when it 's dirty it does n't get everything else dirty . it 's such a simple concept product , but so great ! the only complaint i have is that sometimes it does n't stick very well ... ..
1	this was a baby shower gift and although the baby is still too little to use it , i can say that it is exactly as described and the parents were thrilled to receive it .
1	this is a well constructed , cute bounce seat and my baby loves it . i am very pleased with the purchas
1	this is a very cute table perfect for my 2 kids . they like having picnics outside sitting at their table that is just the right size for them . as far as assembly my husband put it together rather quickly and it is very sturdy . i am pleased with my purchase
1	the sizes are perfect , especially the small one for my 5 month old . the suction works fine so far , but we will see as baby gets older
0	i bought this to take my infant 's temperature , since she does n't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm . i decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate , and it never gave the same reading twice . first it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2 , etc . i tested it on myself , my daughter and my husband . then i gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe i just was n't doing it correctly and he had the same results . i have taken it back to target and am trying a different brand . do not waste your money on this product
1	this potty is just right for our little boy . he seemed comfortable from the first time we placed him on it . his little feet touch the ground , and the shape not only supports him but also protects for little boy mishaps and gives him something to hold on to while bearing down . i would definitely recommend this , especially if you are starting early !
0	one reviewer , though she raves about it , admits its flaw : it cant be put back into its carrying form . indeed , it 's a floppy , illconceived mess . it basically works but there is a much better option out there : the buggybag . this `` floppy '' is not an easy one hand install , it doesnt totally protect the child as a ) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact ( not all covers do that as one reviewer proposes ) and b ) because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car . after trying the floppy mess and a miserable seat called the shop'n'dine , i 've found the buggybag to be the perfect solution : truly a neat one hand install ; easy zip back into its carrying shape ; 2 belts ( one for baby , one for cart ) neat and simply storage options . ( read my amapedia article ) dont take my word for it , go to a big baby store and try out both . just standing there you 'll see that there 's no comparison . i 'm ... shocked that there are people who liked the floppy , but sure they never tried the buggybag .
1	this carseat is a good value . the pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow . i did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that 's expected in a 4 month old . it reclines far enough that her head does n't fall forward and it 's so simple to adjust the straps . overall very nice carseat for the money i spent .
0	the item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve . i ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completley different diaper . these are thicker , better quality and have blue stitching and `` gerber '' stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers . the diapers i got were thinner , plain white and had no stamp . buyer beware ! you will not get what you see in this current photo
0	as with all other reviews , our gate worked well for a while then the latch broke as well . there is no way to fix it . the company did nothing to help us with the situation , except to suggest that we buy an whole new one . no thanks ! i would encourage anyone who has purchased this gate to send your complaints to the company , as i am doing . though the company says they have made improvements to the product , the gates are still breaking and should be recalled . their representative told me there is no reason to recall the gates since it is not a safety issue , however , they advertise its use for the top of stairs ! i called the first years , and they said to send your complaints to : judy paulette rc2 the first years 100 technology center dr. suite 2a stoughton , ma 02072
1	for all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled , that is incorrect . it was the original hip hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves . so unless you have an older model that was bought before 2/2005 , you should have nothing to worry about . this product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the baby bjorn . i have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies .
1	i ordered this pack after my friend 's baby shower , she received this as a gift and i was amazed at how nice it was . it fit both her and her husband very well , so i ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in . we love it . it is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great . our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it , it has made our walks more enjoyable , i have free hands to hold our dogs ' leashes and she likes being up to see everything . i only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack , but it is so minute of a complaint i still give it 5 stars . oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get , i can not wait to go on a day hike . i had been pricing other packs and they were close to $ 200 , this was $ 90 w/ free shipping , a huge price break , plus i got it in about 3 days , thanks amazon
0	i agree with the first reviewer , '' cindy '' -- i love the concept , but the proportions on this swaddler just are n't right , unless you have a really tiny baby or one that does n't kick his/her legs much ( my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long. ) . the velcro does n't hold because the patches are too small , and the knit fabric is too stretchy . however , i put him in the larger size swaddleme today , and it fits much better
1	i have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs . the gates are attached to the walls . i have not had any problems with the either gate . for those of you searching for a gate for a dog , the gate works will with by 70 pound boxer .
1	i recently purchased this monitor when my old fisher price 49 mhz sounds 'n lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year . i could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs . i figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim . well ... it works and i enjoy this monitor so much better that i am considering replacing my other fisher price one . with this monitor i do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise . my other one makes a low static sound all the time , it is not bother some but i can still hear it . i would highly recommend this model . the price is great and i have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that i can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries . a great find , a great buy , a great product
1	i used this pump with my first child 2 years ago . i tried to avoid paying the $ 300+ for the electric pump , and this worked great ! i pumped when i returned to work , and pumped for 3 months . i loved not having to lug around the big electric pump to and from work every day . it 's much easier to clean than other manual pumps ( e.g . gerber ) because there are few parts to remove so your chance of losing or breaking parts is much lower . the pump has a strong suction , so i 've had no problem expressing milk ( e.g . up to 8 ounces or more each time ) . i just had my 2nd child a month ago , and already i 'm able to express 5+ ounces of milk at once . i highly recommend this , especially for occasional users , no need to spend lots of money on fancy pumps with lots of removable , breakable parts . also , i am small chested , so no , you do n't have to be well endowed for this to work
0	i was very disappointed in this mirror . i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because i do use the mirror . i have a 2000 vw passat with a headrest in the middle seat so i had no problem installing it . it 's great to watch my little one while i drive . i do see the other reviewer 's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road . however , it never obstructed my view at all . i registered for this because of the remote control feature . well , the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit `` on '' ( remote control access mode ) in order for it to work . there 's a switch on the unit to play music or turn the lights on and play music . you can not control that feature from the remote control . you also can not control the volume from the remote . it 's really a pain . i 'm keeping it because i like the mirror but i 'm not happy with it . save your money and buy the safefit baby in sight mirror .
1	the crib just the way it comes is best . a thicker mattress would be bad for 2 reasons . firm is best to avoid suffocation dangers . bumber pads are also recommended against by *all* modern advice sites and classes . sids deaths appear to be related to suffocation , and this happens usually when the baby 's mouth and nose are against padding . firm mattress ( like this very thin one ) are much safer . the main thing is to always lay the infant on it 's back to sleep , and not on it 's belly . also , never use a bumber padding in *any* crib for any very young child . finally , there is also the issue of `` outgassing '' of any kind of waterproof plastic type matress covers and foam filling . what you want , if you ca n't afford the very expensive natural options , is a *thin* mattress like this one , that wo n't have a lot of material to outgas , thus reducing the exposure of your baby to these common somewhat toxic vocs . best is to buy this a few weeks ( or longer ) ahead of time , and then air out the mattress . i 'm even putting ours in the clothes dryer on low heat just past the switch off point , so that the drying heats it up a little and then clicks off the heat and continues exhausting air past it until the end of cycle . this is my own idea of how to accelerate the outgassing , so that our new baby in january wo n't have much vocs to breath .
1	this new maclaren stroller is fantastic ! we just returned from three weeks in france with this great stroller . it can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street . it is very light and we love the new shoulder strap . i have 3 kids and this is the best stroller i have ever used
0	if you are looking to make a mess , lose milk and get frustrated , these are the bags for you . first , these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag . you have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself . also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out . it 's not that easy . the first time i did it i lost a whole bunch of milk . your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there . the worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk . this never happened with the other bags on the market . my favorite is lansinoh . another bag thing about these medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others . pass on this and try others
0	i heard lots about the avent brand while pregnant and registered for all avent bottles . boy am i glad that someone gave me soothies and parent 's choice anti-colic bottles too ! ! the nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them . she loves the other two brands , and i love the parent 's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot . do n't waste time or money with avent !
0	we purchased this stroller because of the weight ( 10lbs ) ease of lifting it/out of the car . two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart . the shade is barely big enough to shield anything , let alone provide protection for the child . we received a replacement cover , but was advised that this would be a one time replacement . the tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off . our 8 mo . old is 17 lbs . and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver . for straight paths , great . if you have to take a turn or change direction quickly , do not plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift . the front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight . having had a pliko previously for my 4 yr old , we thought we could trust the name of peg perego . unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well , we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone .
0	i have never written a review , but in this case , i feel compelled to do so . i purchased the imonitor last week as an upgrade to a safety 1st dual monitor , for no other reason than i was tired of the interference . i was excited to learn of the digital technology , and once i got it home , i was anxious to try it . after a few nights trying it out , i was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back ... let me explain : to begin with , before you buy , please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud , which was troublesome since i am a light sleeper . i would have been able to deal with it , but there are other problems as well ... there are 'clicks ' and 'crackles ' that are intermittent , and , like i said before , not good for a light sleeper . the final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- i spent a half hour resetting it , reconfiguring the layout , powering on/off -- all to no avail . it kept beeping 'out of range ' -- i was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time . absolutely unacceptable . in all fairness , we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor , but that is n't an excuse..it says 'crystal clear clarity ' and '2000 foot range ' , but this is not , i repeat , not the case . so , i packed it back up and went into babies r us to return it ... here 's the kicker : the salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the imonitors returned than any other monitor . she rec 'd the sony , but it does n't come with two parent units , so i have resigned myself to living with the safety 1st..even with all of its interference , it is still superior , and 1/4 of the price as the imonitor . i have no doubt that digital is the next step in baby monitors ... but so far graco does not have it figured out ... save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system .
1	my sister has a small one bedroon apt and this product was perfect
1	i got this toy when my baby was 7 months old , and he 's now 8 1/2 months old . we 've used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from los angeles to phoenix ( 7+ hours each way ) . it does n't work miracles , but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss , about 70 % -80 % of the time . and i think it 's more effective now than it was when we first got it , maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it . it might help that i *only* use it when he starts to fuss . i have n't had any problems with the toy working , and the volume dial is a nice feature . it does have its shortcomings , though , like some of the other reviewers pointed out : it only stays on for about 15 minutes ( presumably to save batteries ) so pretty much every time i put the baby in his carseat , i push the button to turn it on , just in case we need it during the drive . it sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror , but it still works to distract him . it plays 5 or 6 songs in random order , but they are all extremely short , so it ends up being very repetitive . overall , i think it 's a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips , and when it does n't work it 's generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that i do n't think anything would really help except getting him out of the car . and even though the repetitive songs can get annoying , it 's far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together
1	this crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for . our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it 's way . great customer service . the quality of the bed is outstanding . we purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes
1	i bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one . this is the only one i still wear . traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes . i bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when i go out . i sleep in the medela bra and wear it around the house . i am quite large breasted , and i find they have plenty of support . i even do low-impact aerobics in it . it is worth every penny
1	i have a 10 month old baby and i have tried every bottle . i used the avent with my 1st baby . these bottles are the best ! why ? because they do not leak , no bubbles and the design is fabulous once the baby holds it her/himself . the angles top is great for little or no air in baby 's tummy . the little rubber seal/disk you put in the bottom is a cinch ! do n't wast time or money $ $ $ on any other bottle
0	i would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all ! this seemed like a good idea , but my little guy was kicking and moving all over . it barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath . it also says that it is for 0 months on up , but i definitely would n't use this if your baby ca n't sit
1	this product is great . it is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it . but i found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier . makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old
1	i bought these extensions because i had to have them so that the co-sleeper would fit properly next to my bed . however , when added the sleeper did n't seem as steady or stable on the floor . there was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them . while not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed , i expected something a little more solid or sturdy .
0	my husband and i purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby 's birth . we do n't really like it . our wipes dry out down to about the third , sometimes fourth wipe . that 's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change ! ( that 's a lot of wasted money ) other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full . but with a newborn , infant or even a toddler i prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it 's time to refill with the other half . we had a wrap-around warmer with our first child . it wore out around the time we started potty training her . that 's the style of wipe warmer i would recommend for new parents , not this one
1	our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first , but now that she 's 4 months old , she loves this toy ! we recommend it !
1	the pack and play netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your pack and play outside . the netting keeps the bugs out ! it is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag . it also fits easily over the graco pack and plays
1	this baby gate is ideal for the size and price . i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate . the hardware mount , eye hooks , are not the sturdiest , but this gate definately gets the job done
1	this is a great potty for boys . we had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty , in the potty . easy to clean , too
0	i bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck . this item was made for a portable/small crib , not your typical crib . i had to go out and spend another $ 40 . on velcro so i can make it long/wide enough to fit my son 's crib . it is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib . do n't waste your money on something that is not going to work .
0	we purchased the crib , armoire , dresser w/ tower it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us . once we received it , we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely cracked pieces . after inspecting them , we found that the dmg was n't caused by packaging but , poor craftsmanship . most pieces were assembled using a nailgun some of the nails were even bent . the cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed continued all the way up the piece of furniture . had the co pre drilled the holes used screws instead , this would 've never happended . obviously it 's `` cheaper '' to use nails instead of screws . we took pictures of the dmgs i wish i could attach them to this review so you 'd be able to see for yourself . there were also several areas inside the crib which were n't sanded properly would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood . it was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods , but in all actuality it 's pine . when you think of hardwood , you expect oak or birch , not a softwood like pine . the tops of the furniture the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood . everything else was particle board . some of the solid wood pieces were n't even 1 piece of wood , but 3 they were glued together . we 're currently trying to return this product for a full refund . we 're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date . i would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again .
1	this is great for young babies..once my son became more active ( which is when it 's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway ) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it 's very thin - unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w/ a crib set . i think that is the only flaw but i will definitely use it again for my next infant/baby
0	this monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our tokyo apartment . although the monitor is sensitive and clear , moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal
0	i bought this item on my own because i read the wonderful reviews it received . i really do n't know how this item can be used . even if you do n't use the air-vented cups ( which collect the leaking milk ) , you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing . i was wearing a sweater you could see the shape of the shells right through it . if you do use the cups they supply , you look absolutely abnormal . i guess this does n't work for large-breasted women
1	i have been looking for the perfect diaper bag and this is it ! ! the description does n't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs . to start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs , which is quick and easy to access . the heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total ; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other . there is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside ... the perfect area for mom 's stuff . there is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag . the construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage . finally , the graphite and green is very unisex , where many diaper bags are not so father friendly . i am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable !
0	i bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we 're out running . not only do the tabs not stick , as any toddler would , she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world . would n't you ?
1	i love this key and cell phone set so much i 'm buying another one for a friend . i looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall . my 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone . ( actually even my older kids think it 's pretty neat . ) great product.. great price
1	my daughter loves this toy ! all the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break , too :
1	my son loves these blocks . we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set . he loves saying the colors , numbers and stacking them
0	all i could hear was the local am radio station -- and even that wasnt clear ... spend some more money and get something better..
1	when my third child was born , we got this tub . it has been the best yet for us . from infant stage to now 6 months old , my daughter has fit snugly . as an infant , the sling is perfect because you ca n't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached . we used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink , which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage . once her stump fell off , and she was able to control her head well , we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby 's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub . a perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath . this is the position in which we currently use our tub . now , however , we bathe her in the aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we do n't have to worry about where the water lands . finally , once baby is old enough to sit without support , we 'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time . no doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead
1	i was surprised at what a good size this rug was . it matches the bedding perfect . the only negative thing i can say about it , is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it . i put it right in front of my son 's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib . it could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place
0	the maternity support did n't stay in place . it kept bunching up in one spot and did n't help my back at all ! i would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product
1	we have 4 yr old twins and an 18 month old , and selected this gate as a means to block off our dining room from the living room . we needed the gate ( which already came with one extension panel ) plus one more extension panel ( we purchased additional ) for a total of 107 inches across . it was n't that horrible to install -- just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours . if you measure well and take your time , it 's not that difficult . also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability . as for durability , you need an adult sized hand to open this latch -- my almost 5-yr-olds ca n't do it . the extra foot adds stability . the baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds . we like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose , since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs . as for appearance , the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things . we 've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate ( and matching stairwell gates ) from guests , and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we 're entertaining company . i think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate ( it 's not a brick wall ! ) , or installed it wrong . i would recommend this gate to anyone , especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace
1	when my daughter was born , i did n't know about swaddling , and it would take me hours to get her to sleep ! i would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep , then put her in her crib ... and she 'd flail her arms , wake up and cry , and i had to start all over ! what a nightmare ! then i figured out that since her arms wake her , it would make sense to wrap her in something so she could n't move them as much ... so i started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier to get her to sleep . but then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again . when she was a little over a month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets on the internet and immediately bought it . it worked great ! it was so easy to wrap my daughter in it , and it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would 've saved me from so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son was born , and thankfully i already knew about those blankets from the start . he goes to sleep great in the swaddleme blanket ! out of curiosity , i tried to put him to sleep without this blanket , and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter ! i consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy . it should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep
1	just what i wanted ! a portable , waterproof , durable , padded , easy to clean changing pad .
0	not only did the product get delivered 3 days later than expected , my child 's grandfather who is in the construction industry installed the seat and the entire set broke off of the bowl the first time anyone sat on it . and nobody in this household is overweight
0	the monitor was terrible ! it would only pick up our baby 's voice when she was screaming . it had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference . it is going back to the store and i am looking for something else . i wish i would have checked ratings first ! choose something else
0	if i could rate it no stars i would.let me tell you that my son is now 8 , and is perfectly normal , especially as a baby , but i 'll tell you what you do n't need a microwave ... .technically they are dangerous for the fomula , the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it hard shake then your all set ... it 's that easy do n't be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula
1	i havent had any problems with the bottles leaking like others have stated , but i guess i always check and make sure the lid is on right . the suction isnt too fast , which is great . my baby doesnt get choked . she latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves . my only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose . there isnt a curve in the bottle , so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more , which i dont like , or either mash the bottle on her nose . its avoidable , but i tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes . id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer . i still use the bottles , but i just have to make sure the whole time i 'm feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath
1	this item was very cute . the different textures ( just like the bedding set ) are a lot of fun . i hung 2 on the wall above my sons changing table and he loves to look at them . my only complaint is the ribbon loops they 've sewn on to hang them . mine were not sewn into the middle of the square and so they originally hung uneven . you can easily use a nail or other type of homemade hook though
1	i wanted this set since i saw it in babies-r-us , but it was so much more expensive . this is perfect for my new baby girl . i always loved hello kitty and i hope she will too . also , there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set . the lamp , rug , and mobile are a must ! = ) the set comes with only one window valance , and as my nursery has 2 windows , i had to purchase an additional valance . just something to keep in mind when buying this
0	this product is absolutely useless . save your money . the first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it . in addition , there 's no way to attach it to the carrier , stroller , or whatever . so when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it , all it does is slide around . so it 's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout
1	this is the first baby monitor we 've tried and we are quite happy with it . we did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability . i like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall . i do n't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great . when in the normal mode , i can hear little birds outside my baby 's window and cars passing our house ; it 's quite sensitive ! i also like the lights on the receiver ; you can turn the volume all the way down if you 're watching a movie or something
1	we have these straps all over our house ( on every piece of furniture taller than two feet ) , because we have two `` climbers . '' there have been two occasions that i know of where these saved my eldest daughter from injury , as she climbed large pieces of furniture . the hardest part of installing these is finding them . we searched several local stores , with little luck - and a few odd looks , as salespersons did n't understand why we would want to strap our furniture to the walls when we do n't live in an earthquake zone . but trust me , once you find somewhere that sells them , buy them up . once you see how well they work , you will become addicted to testing to see if you can tip your furniture - and will want them everywhere .
1	we purchased the fisher-price open top take-along swing a few months ago for our daughter , and have been very pleased with its quality and performance . we have n't had any problems with the operation of the swing , even as our little one has grown to her present weight of 18+ lbs . it runs on c batteries , which for us seem to last almost a month with moderate use . this swing has several great features . it folds up very easily and really is as portable as claimed . it pops right in the trunk for trips to grandma 's house , and i 've also used it quite a bit in the backyard when i want to do yard work . having a 5 year-old in the house , i also appreciate being able to quickly carry it from room to room . being only a flat 5 foot tall with short ( and admittedly weak ) arms , i have a lot of difficulty carrying the swing with the baby in it , but the swing is lightweight enough to carry one-handed while the baby 's in the other arm . though i 'm pleased with this swing , i 'd really recommend it in *addition* to a traditional baby swing rather than instead of one . the compact nature of this swing means that the rocking motion is very fast-moving , unlike the slow , soothing motion of taller swings . my daughter seems to like the take-along swing just fine when she 's in an alert , awake mood . when she 's tired , however , it just goes too quickly , even on the lowest setting , and seems to overstimulate her rather than calm her down . i 'd originally purchased this with the idea of replacing our full-sized graco swing , but we 've ended up keeping both around as they seem to fill different needs . overall , i 'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you 're only going to have one swing in your house , you might consider whether you 'd be more grateful for a big swing that rocks your baby to sleep , or this little one that entertains during those fussy , bouncy times
0	i am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all , therefore i would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation . i liked the concept of this item and it was comfy . i had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working . i would not recomend this pump , at least not to adoptive mothers . the customer service was awesome though ! ! ! they were understanding and helpful . i eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela .
1	i know that after looking at the price tag , one might be confused why i say economical ; however , when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands ( for those exploding messes ) - they are a value . these wipes have the right amount of wetness to them to clean an area thoroughly with one wipe most of the time . of course they smell amazing and are the softest wipe i 've ever seen . i have only positive remarks for these wipes
0	i got this bra when i was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery . after my delivery the bra was too small . with the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small . i was n't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery . i thought they were big just before delivery . i decided to go w/ bravado bra . it has worked out much better . it is comfortable to wear day and night . and as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way . the sizes are more flexable then medela . the strap support is better then medela . i have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another . no use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding . and breastfeeding is their main purpose
1	as most of the other reviewers , i live in a small townhome . this chair is wonderful . it takes up very little space and is so easy to clean . i remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean . the rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher . despite carrots , prunes , etc . being mashed into it , the tray has n't stained at all . i recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends
1	we used the small size until our daughter was too long for it ( around 3 months old ) and switched to the large size . she still loves it and is sleeping great ( 3 day naps and 10-11 hours uninterrupted sleep at night ) ! it is part of her naptime/bedtime routine and it travels with us so she can get good sleep in a familiar environment wherever we are . the velcro has been a lifesaver and the microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated .
0	i really was disappointed with this product . our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile .
1	this backless booster is a simple , last step booster bottom for kids who are ready to buckle themselves and like to change where they sit and are old/big enough to know their part . the booster is light but well made . its use is super easy , but the one piece arms help giude the passive restraint seat belts . the fun color was a good bonus
1	the first time i used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep ( need i say anymore ) ? it fits nearly every shopping cart , it 's easy to fold and unfold , and it gives me the peace of mind knowing that all of those shopping cart germs are n't coming home with us ! well worth the extra peace of mind it gives me
0	i received this swing as a gift . i really liked that it was more of a cradle swing , that the tray was removable ( in fact i never even put it on and it was great ) , and the fact that it swings side to side , like a crade , or front and back , like a normal swing . my baby loved it , the music , the mobile , etc . in the early months , it was the only place that she would sleep without me , so i loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me . what i did n't like about it was # 1 , it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly , and # 2 the speed control was pretty stupid , i thought since all the speeds were the same , no matter which setting you have the swing on . but if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing
1	i 've been searching for the perfect tub for my baby and i think i 've found it ! we 've been using a plastic reclined tub since he was born , but he has clearly outgrown it . i tried one of those seat tubs ( ? ) , but he hated it and it seemed to scratch his legs ... terrible tub . thankfully i was able to return that one . i found this one here on amazon and reluctantly purchased it . glad i did ! ! it allows a lot more freedom for him to explore and play ( now that he can sit up unsupported ) . bath time has become much more fun ... for both mom baby ! update : i first reviewed this after we purchased the item . i 've been using it for just over 1 month now and one of the seams has already torn . i do n't think i 've used this item improperly to cause it to happen sooner than `` expected '' . unfortunately , the patch-kit piece that came with the tub is significantly too small to patch it up completely . very unfortunate because we loved the tub . new rating : 3 stars because of how quickly the seam tore
0	the ac adaptor and sound selections are great , but the sound is way too low , even on the highest level . i foolishly bought this , knowing that others thought it was too low ... but it really is so low you ca n't hear it 4 feet away . turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me .
0	i would not recommend this crib mattress pad . i followed the washing instructions prior to first use , and the pad would not fit on the mattress . when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress , they tore . luckily amazon took it back
1	if your looking for a no frills chair this is the one . i did n't find it terribly difficult to put together but was suprised at how well made the tray and seating area is . i did n't want to spend a whole lot of money on a highchair being the fact that my older kids when they were big enough they would rather sit on a booster seat . it does recline but i keep the seat in the upright for my 6 month old . she seems to like it better that way . the only thing i would complain about is i do n't care for the way the belt is . i may be using it incorrectly ( at least it seems like that ) but it holds the baby ( and that 's what it 's meant for )
0	it is very difficult to attach it to anything . the straps are to short and under strange angel . my son did not play with it
1	this is the best potty seat that you can buy . it 's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard . also , i love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall
1	this seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for suvs . in contrast to one of the other reviews ( and i am not affiliated with the seat manufacturer ) , this seat does the job adequately , and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs , measurements , fit , etc. , imho . there is no `` universal '' seat saver or , for that matter , car seat , that will fit every car . this one manages to catch most of the itty-bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat , and hence , serves its purpose well
0	i bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play . when putting it together christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off . also , one light does not work . the poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from fischer-price . i will be returning ( not exchanging ) this toy . luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it
1	i recently purchased the zooper tango sidy by side double stroller . i had done some looking at stores extensive research online . suddenly , i found this on amazon of all places . the reviews were great the price was right . i bought it , a little hesitant that i had n't gotten to test drive it . this stroller is great ! it fits through doorways , it 's a little tight in an aisle , but we 're talking about a double stroller here , it 's going to be a little wide ! i have a 2 year old 1 year old , so i do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on , just slightly . it is heavier than the peg perego aria is , but it feels much more solid . folds easily somewhat compactly ( again , it 's a double stroller ! ) . it fits into the back of my honda odyssey with room for bags whatnot . i would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones . my 2 year old likes to `` nap '' ( recline the seat ) while we are walking . the back zips off , she likes to look out the back . a 5 point harness keeps everyone safe , but i find that i usually just use it as a waist seat belt . storage is limited , my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw ... there is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items ( a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water ) a zip pocket on the back of the stroller . however , if you unzip the back remove it , you have lost this pocket . i did read that mcclaren has a stroller organizer for about [ ... ] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff . overall , i do love our new stroller would highly recommend it !
1	i purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old . at first , he seemed a little intimidated by the toys , and would cry when i put him in it . once he got used to it , he really enjoyed it . now he plays with all the toys , and he likes that it wobbles around . his favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads . i did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about . just lucky i guess . the seat is really hard to remove for washing , which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of
0	i think the mobile is very cute , but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly . i tried attaching it in several differnt places . i am going to return it .
1	i love this item with my first son and i got them again for my second son . great product , keeps them warm without getting overheated and then you do n't have to worry about loose blankets at night
1	i had this highchair delivered to my new great grandaughter so i am reporting what they said about it . `` great
0	after spending over $ 30 for this item , we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across . a seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong . would not purchase again or recommend to others
0	heed the bad reviews . i think the problem may be medela 's definition of `` occasional use . '' i used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half -- and apparently that is deemed more than occasional , because the pump yields very little now ... about half of what it used to . so this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion : i should have gotten a different pump
1	i got this when my daughter was 4 months old . she would sit in it for about 5 minutes , then want to get out . but now that she is 6 1/2 months , she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself . she has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys , and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth . when we go to family functions or just to someone 's house , we always grab the entertainer . it is very easy to break down and put right back together ( if it does n't fit in the car ) . this by far is the best toy that she enjoys and learns from . she is quite tall for her age , 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this . this is the best $ $ $ $ we have spent so far
1	i actually had put this on my daughter 's wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because i just could n't wait to see if she 'd get it for her 1st birthday . i always take tubbies with my daughter so i like to have fun toys in the tubby that i enjoy too . my daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too - i have to admit i play with it more than she does at this point . she 's only 9-1/2 months right now so i think as she gets a bit older she 'll enjoy it more . my only complaint , and the reason i did n't give it 5 stars , it should come with more play sheets and they are not waterproof . other than that , a fun toy . after i got this , i did find it at target for the same price it 's listed here with no s charges but still do n't regret getting it .
1	it 's a great manual pump , but it 's just a manual pump after all . manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk . it would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if i had to take that much time out of every work day . however i do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies ( like the time i forgot my other pump at home ) or for out-of-office meetings ( because it 's small and discrete ) . it 's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while . i 'm giving it 4 stars because i do n't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job
1	this boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well . we 've washed it in the washing machine several times , and it 's very durable . if you 're looking for a soft , simple , durable boppy slipcover , i 'd highly recommend this one
1	i brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet . the suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet . i going to buy more for my other room .
1	there is no way my daughter will be able to get through this gate . she is the most rambunctious little girl too . and she is only 10 months old . she is already running around and able to walk really well on her own . and she loves the stairs . this gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they 're not even with the wall either . the banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide . and with the configure gate and one extension , there is no way i will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates , which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are . this is the only gate that i have found that works perfect for our home . plus the door in the gate is easy to use . you do n't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it , but it 's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle . i love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate , it wo n't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install . i 'm so happy that my husband and i bought this gate . it is an all around great investment . if you are considering buying a baby gate , you should really invest in a great baby gate . and i highly recommend this gate . and with the extensions it can fit anywhere in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard . if you want a gate for your home , and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it , get this gate
0	i saw this and i thought it would be great . it would keep my daughter 's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops . it does do those things but it is hard to clean . it gets pretty dirty , and in the catching pouch , there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of . i used it twice and will never use it again . i recommend the table toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done . they stay in place better , and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table . i use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did . her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier . you do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag .
0	you have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold . not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria , especially if you are wiping , then put your hands back in to get another wipey
1	i love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it . i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud . i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use . so now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth . if i had to do it all over again - i would still buy this swing b/c of the design . i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
1	i gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the nicu . because of that i was forced to establish my milk supply w/ a breastpump . the morning after i gave birth my husband went walmart to pick up some of things that we had n't purchased . i called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples . well this is what he brought back . the relief was instantaneous . i bought a couple more boxes as my daughter `` learned '' to breastfeed . i use another of their nipple creams for everyday use ( they 're too expensive to use everday ) , but i make sure that there is always a box of these in my cabinet !
1	i have to say this is a better made one than some of the others . my mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her . how the cover is designed to fit over the base some of the straps are almost impossible to reach underneath and where it is to be attached . i had to end up using needlenose pliers to pull the strap thru . the arm rest raise up . not sure about the drink holder part ... does n't seem very durable but we will see . other than the cover part i feel this will be a good item
0	do n't buy this humidifier ! it is much too loud
1	i purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby . my plan was to carry it along with me whenever i would visit family and friends at their homes . i could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface . the blanket is 16.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 inches , which will accommodate adults well . i was pleased when i received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece . the quality is absolutely top notch ! the surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur . the only slight con i have of the essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side . this is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time . otherwise i adore this blanket and highly recommend it
1	this is the greatest product . they stick to every restaurant table i have ever secured them to , are lightweight , easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at . every time i pull one out of the diaper bag she says `` elmo , elmo , elmo '' . they keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple . i would n't do without them , they are great
1	i ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up , and not just the sides . this is also sometimes refered to as a `` 4-sided changing pad '' since all 4 edges are raised . it seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser , effectively converting the dresser to a changing table . the only reason i did n't rate this higher was that it did n't include a non-skid pad on the bottom of the pad . also , it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover . next , i need to order some covers for it , since the baby does n't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface . i am not sure which covers to order
1	i 've been very pleased with the performance of this monitor . we have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference . i 've use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception . i think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it
0	not good for larger houses . ours picks up radio signals sometimes
0	i think that i 've tried every bag that i have found and have been disappointed with all of them . these were just about the worst ! ! my daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding . i wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so i pumped . i have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day . i went through alot of bags ( i use bottles now ) and these were a pain . they were small , thin , punctured easily , and those twist ties ( although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept ) were just a pain in the butt . i love medela 's pumps ( i own the pump in style advanced , a seperate manual pump , and used the lactina hospital pump for 3 months ) , i like their storage bottles , i even like their nipple cream , but these bags need some more work put into them
0	we bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby , who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own . initially it looked great , seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys . however , getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp , and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum , it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees . it 's not as if he is going to get any shorter , so i do n't think there is any solution to the problem . i think safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable , or even put some padding at that location . i 'm surprised more reviewers did n't have this problem . for our baby , who normally loves bathtime , it was a painful and frightening experience . we will be returning the item . since you ca n't leave your baby unattended in water anyway , we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance . i recommend you save your money on this one
1	i already have a single jogging stroller ( not a bob ) and have been happy with it . we are in the process of adopting our second child , which we had less than 24 hours notice about , so a lot of money is going to legal costs , baby stuff , and my time off of work , and as a result i was concerned about spending this much on a stroller , but is was worth every cent . with the bob duallie , i am ecstatic , overjoyed , delighted , thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out . for my first trip out , i put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk . the trip was so smooth , both kids slept for most of the time . the seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat , no problems with his head bobbing around ( pardon the pun ) . the shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride , which transits to less work for my arms . i did n't realize how much effort went into the other stroller , pushing it and turning it . the smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster , a plus when trying to lose weight . the stroller can turn in circles on itself , allowing for extremely sharp turns . very nice , especially when inside a small store , like starbucks . the windows up top are well placed enough that i can actually see my kid 's face , not just their little bodies . the straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller i 've used . there is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid 's shoulders . the straps at the waist do n't come out of the sides , ( this is kinda hard to explain ) the strap is attached in the center of the seat , and the sides come around the child , more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit . even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller . as for the mesa orange , it is more like a burnt orange , with brown trim and i am very glad i got it ! it is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos . be sure to get the tray , i forgot to order it with the stroller . the storage is a little shallow , but being double wide , there is still plenty of room for stuff .
1	this mat works great kids ca n't throw it on the floor , it catches food , i love it ! !
0	i was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere i looked , so i figured it must be awesome . not so . it is loud , which freaked out my 8 month old , and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well . i 've tried every aspirator on the market , and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital . i took that one home with me , and urge you to do the same : ) very disappointed
1	if you are flying alone with a small child , you should not go without this . it 's a tight fit , but it works
1	this is one interesting toy ! i love the way it creates music when it floats on top of the water ! you can even create music for it , which is something i 've never thought would be possible . kids today have it made !
1	the best bib around ! wash and dry , and large enough to catch everything . i will never again use another bib
1	this particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do . i hardly know this pillow is in bed with us , and when i do notice it i ca n't help but to think of how nice and soft it is . a great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile . the pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position . this is a great product and i highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs , pregnant belly , and face and hands . one nice thing i forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side .
0	we bought 2 of these and neither one keeps the wipes moist or warm . save your mone
1	this is a wonderful stroller . i 'm so glad i took a chance and ordered it , sight unseen . i ordered the red version , which is much snazzier in person than on the amazon picture . it is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our graco model , but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers , nice and sturdy . but it folds up in an umbrella fashion , so it wo n't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried , if necessary . it comes with neat things like a rain cover , sun shade , and cold weather boot . the rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller 's basket . the canopy has a window , provides lots of shade , and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day . coolest of all , it has a built in mesh pouch that does n't take up any room but still manages to hold everything i need : sunscreen , hand sanitizer , wallet , keys , cell phone , and sunglasses . it 's stretchy mesh , so if you do n't have anything it just lies flat against the hood . but it does have a plastic lining , so it 's waterproof ! also , it zips , so your things ca n't fall out and are n't accessible to your two year old , either . the basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag , although a small bag would fit best , especially if you want to keep the boot in there . the best part is that everything is snazzy . everything looks nice , the materials feel great , and it 's well designed . the parts that should be removable/washable are . it 's a snap to put together ( took just a couple of minutes ) and everything locks into place in a smart way . it 's very easy to fold and unfold . also , it reclines beautifully and easily , including into a totally upright position . i became frustrated that my graco model 's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old . the place where your child 's legs hang down is neat . it is adjustable , so it could stick straight out , hang down , or even flip up for a very little one ( maybe to use with the boot ? ) ... your kid wo n't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees . it has the newer style which i notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in . my graco model ( purchased last year ) is such a complicated mess . you attach two things together on one side , two things together on the other side , then connect each side into the center . arg ! my son almost always fussed by the time i 'd finished . also , he was always sitting on one of the straps , which easily became twisted . my husband still has not figured out how to do this quickly . : ) so this is a big improvement . it 's also comfy ! i ca n't vouch for that myself , of course . but my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable . with the graco model , he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he was n't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot . a few minor imperfections about the zooper twist . the cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle . it works well for a standard water bottle or something , but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great . you can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment , if that is important to you . this stroller is great for me - i 'm 5'5 . it would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable . this is n't a jogging stroller . it does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel , which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage . this is n't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink , if you are looking for that kind of stroller . there is n't a cup and snack tray for your child . no clock . this is just the greatest stroller and i 'm so glad to dump our awful graco stroller . hated . that . thing . this is snazzy , well designed , handy , lightweight , convenient , and offers everything we need
0	i ordered this item . i have bought directly from baby universe before , but now i 've had several problems . i ended up cancelling this order because after i inquired to baby universe , i was told that the item was backordered . they did n't know when it would be available . i also ordered a jj cole bundle me lite from them . it arrived fairly quickly , but was slashed through by a box cutter . i 've been trying to get it exchanged , but their customer service is lacking . i wo n't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now . i 'm not so sure that i would buy from this company . they seem to be slipping - perhaps they ca n't quite handle the amount of business they are getting . disappointing . just got an ra number for the item , but it has to be shipped back to jj cole and who knows when i 'll get the item shipped to me . they do n't even give you the address to ship the returned item to . wo n't let me do a return . this is a bad way to run a business
0	i 've owned my diaper dekor plus for just under 2 years . at first , i thought it worked fine . it was easy to deal with , and easy to empty . the first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months ( 1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2 's ) . however , the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months . since then i 've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum . definitely not convenient . the unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control . unlike the diaper champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape , diaper dekor has no such provision . it has two `` trap doors '' that allow you to drop the diaper in easily , and then they are supposed to spring back into place . still , no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in , and let the top lid fall closed , strong odors inevitably escape . also , these `` trap doors '' are quite flimsy . the hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position , thereby contributing to the odor problem . i inquired about a replacement from regal lager and they said i could purchase one for $ 10 . instead i decided to purchase a new diaper champ , since i 've pretty much had it with this thing . speaking of flimsy , there are two other flaws i 've experienced . firstly , the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose . it still works , but i have to wonder for how much longer . also , the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly , once again contributing to a lack of odor control . the door is only held shut by a small plastic latch , leaving a significant gap for odors to escape . overall , i have not been impressed with diaper dekor plus . however , contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills , that actually was never one of my bigger complaints . i did not find them cost-prohibitive at all , because you get 3 liners for $ 20 and i found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers . in the 1 year 9 months that i 've owned this system , i 've only had to purchase refills twice . the only thing i did n't like about it was that i did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online ( could n't find any local store that carried them ) and wait for them to be shipped to me , especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner . diaper dekor is the only system i have used extensively , and i would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone . i 'm hoping my diaper champ will serve me better
0	i spent a lot of time researching strollers , and after reading all of the reviews for the aria i decided to register for one . out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight , but i have not been pleased with it since . the shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat . the snack cup has never stayed in place . steering this stroller is impossible ... we took it to disney last month and i almost left it in florida . all in all i expected a lot more from peg perego
0	i bought this item because the faq on the breathable baby website said that the bumper would fit any style crib , including ones with solid headboards . however , once i received the bumper , i realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard . upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit , i was told the following : `` the breathable bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts . if it does , wrap around the outside of the posts . if the breathable bumper wo n't fit your crib you should try the cribshield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides . look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it . '' when i responded that this information was basically too little too late , and that it disagreed with what they said in their faq 's , i was then told : `` the other option moms have been doing is buying 2 breathable bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails . this way they have the padding . in the future , we will be selling them as a package that way , but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire . '' i think it 's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work , they need to purchase a different item or more of the same . customer service at breathable baby has since removed the misleading faq , however , i now am inconvenience with returning the item . i am truly disappointed and wish they could be more upfront on their website about the abilities of the product .
0	first , the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least . second , it is opaque , so the kids could n't even take in their surroundings . since it resembles a parachute , the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing would n't stay attached to the stroller , the kids probably would n't have had fresh air . go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead
0	i received a diaper genie as a shower gift , and gave it a chance . after 8 weeks , we replaced it with a diaper champ , which is much better at containing odor . the problem we had with the genie is that it is too hard to use . you 're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing , then twist twice . when we did this , about 50 % of the time , the twists would come undone , leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell . neither my husband or i could determine how to fix this once it happened , and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily . the diaper champ , however , is one-handed operation , which the genie is not ( you ca n't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper ! ) . it contains the smell incredibly well , as long as you follow the directions ( fold your diapers into balls , and do n't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid ) . we actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the `` blowouts '' , which we have about once a week , to keep the champ clean . it has been a wonderful new baby tool
1	this cup holder works great . i attached it to a pull cart that i needed at work to put books , etc . in after i had foot surgery . it also works on walkers
1	it seems like this carseat arrived about five minutes after i hit the purchase button . it arrived in great condition , too , and they even threw in a sippy cup ! ; - ) the fabric on this cover ( the ashley floral ) is very attractive . i love that it can be rear- or forward-facing . a friend who had already purchased a different seat helped me install this in my car , and she loved it so much more than the one she got that she 's getting this one , once her newborn is too big for her rear-facing-only seat . if only she 'd bought this one , she said , she would n't have to go buy another . have n't had my daughter in it yet , so update coming soon
0	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked , and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose . if you use these mats , the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents . do n't buy !
0	my 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux ( she does n't vomit , it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn ) . she also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old . they were horrible ! we like the playtex premium nurser and the playtex ventaire ( chubby bottles ) much better . we tried the regular dr. browns , but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast . with both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast ... when i sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes ( @ one ounce with the playtex bottles ) , to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces ! we had a horrible night both times we tried the dr. browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow ( we used the slow flow nipples even ! ) . i also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples ' too-fast-flow ( formula fed baby ) . i highly recommend the playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak . we only tried dr. brown to see if it would alleviate the gerd symptoms - it did not ! ! ! !
1	i do n't generally write reviews but wanted to praise baby trend on the design of this car seat . we were directed to it after the january 07 consumer reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests ( tv news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle ) . compared to our still-new safety 1st seat , this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways : 1 ) the base is super easy to install . click twice into each of the car 's two anchor points , then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base . that 's it . our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that did n't leave me as confident as this one . 2 ) the base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby 's head ( no flopping ) . our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels . 3 ) the seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows . no such system on our old seat . 4 ) the handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right . 5 ) if the base is not available , the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car 's lap belt . 6 ) the seat is overall more narrow than our old seat , allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room . every inch helps . 7 ) the seat is lighter than our old seat , although it feels just as secure and solid as the old one . all this , and the seat is the same price as our old one . unfortunately amazon/target was sold out when the consumer reports issue came out , but i found them in stock online at wally world , if you are looking to get one quickly . the one for sale here is a better color combo than wally 's , unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design . summary : super easy to install and adjust , well thought-out features , fair price ! makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :
1	i bought this 2 years ago when i had my first daughter . i used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach ( where it 's usually windy and cooler during the fall ) . it 's very easy to switch from/to any stroller ( less than 1 minute ) . when we visited relatives in canada at xmas , i installed the bundleme on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot . in san diego one fall day , when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet , she ended up wearing only a diaper but the bundleme kept her warm as we walked back home . never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road , or having enough blankets to keep baby warm , or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets , lost a shoe/sock , etc . i am now using the same bundle me with my second child . i 'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks , etc
0	due to the fact that you ca n't give 0 stars , i had to choose a 1 , otherwise it would have been a big fat 0 ! ! ! we bought this mattress when i was pregnant , thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong . a couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping , mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers , no toys , nothing sharp , etc . well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night , and my husband and i go in to see what is the matter , and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out . my poor little one had the springs poking at him . after further examination , we found that under the vinyl is a thin and i stress the word thin , layer of foam , then cardboard piece and then the coils . what a joke ! carboard ! ! ! ! needless to say i went out today and bought him a much better , better constructed simmons mattress . i should note my son is only 17 mths old , and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress , so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths . do n't waste your money ... .you 'll only have to buy another one down the road . take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby ! ! ! afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do ! ! ! from a mom who learned the hard way !
0	i purchased this when i was due to have my second baby . i thought peg perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive . i do n't mind spending the $ $ $ if you get better , but this is just a horrible stroller . it does n't turn easily at all , the wheels constantly get stuck . there is one cup holder that is soooo small and does n't stay upright . there is no room for any storage : bags , pocket book , keys , phone , snack . they trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow . the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep . there is nothing i like about this at all , it makes going out where ever not easy at all . for the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this , they should be ashamed . i actually use my orignal `` cheap '' single stroller , instead .
1	i really like how this step was designed to stay in place . we have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it . this one stays put ! the only reason this stool did n't get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top . it is a little difficult to clean . since this is a potty step stool , it has gotten some messes on it that i wish would have been easier to get rid of
1	i received this as a baby shower gift from my mom and love it ! it is so easy to manuever , you can do it with one hand . the stroller has ample space for bags , purse , etc . below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items . the drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus . the material is so pretty and the colors are great . the best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby , should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather . i would highly recommend this item .
1	the only bottles my daughter would take were the playtex original nursers . i am pumping at work with a medela pump in style , so i was pumping into the medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the playtex drop-ins to feed her . it was a hassle and i never felt like all of the milk , especially the fat , made it from the medela bottles into the drop-ins . and then i heard about this kit and bought two immediately - i have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the drop-ins . the only downside : you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump
1	after months of sleeplessness , i received this pillow as a gift from my mom . it is wonderful , but not for the reasons i thought . i thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins ( which it is ) , but the real relief is that i barely wake up as i flip from one side to the other , since it is nicely wedged between my knees
1	very important note : dot not turn on system before reading this . you have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage , then charge the system for 16 hours . do not turn system on while charging for this first time ! ! ! i did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents ' websites . with most items , there are pros and cons ... see below : pros : -you will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors . this is a significant improvement from monitors in the past . absolutly no interference ! -great reception . you will have no problems picking up your child with this . i can take it outside and work in the yard , with confidence that i will know when my baby needs me . -interchangeable ac power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house . -lightweight and compact system . cons : -the biggest issue is battery life . horrible battery life , typically only 3-4 hours at a time ! the battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband 's opinion . this system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations , i highly recommed the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock . or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock . -with any power interruption the child 's unit shuts off . the parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue , but it can be irritating at 2:00 a.m. to have to get up to turn it back on . graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in . -belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement . the system is better left unattached to belt , unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground . -a bit expensive . a little of both ... pros/cons : -sound : pro : great sound , very clear . in fact i can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor . con : picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive . for the light sleepers , on the softest level still can be very loud . -loud , every 5 seconds , parents warning : pro : beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system . this was nice for us one day when the baby 's system had fallen and came unplugged . if the system had not beeped , we would not have known . con : annoying beeping while searching for signal ... a startling fact in the middle of the night . *overall the system does what it should , but there a few area 's that could be improved . i gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up . *
0	i ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week . one arrived in perfect condition , the other was disappointingly split at the seams . so i returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it . i received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams . so i am returning it once again and asking for a refund , since i feel i will be better just going to the store to buy one that i can inspect before hand . to be honest , the one that arrived in tact works just fine . i guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective . good luck if you decide to order this
0	this is very cute but my baby is chubby . it gave him a cut and bruises on both legs . the seat is n't big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off . i wish it was bigger cause this is really cute . so if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts
1	i have been very impressed with every avent product that i have purchased . i have found these pacifiers to be so nice . they are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them . my baby loves hers . we ca n't live without them
1	this lamp is so much cuter than i was expecting . the quality looks excellent . i looked at cheaper lamps and you get what you pay for . the quality of this lamp is definitely superior to others .
1	we bought this for a trip we will be taking in may but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately . she wants to sit in it to watch tv , take walks or to put her dolls in it . the light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me . this helps with my back problems since i am more likely to have a stoller with me now . it is easy to open , shut and lock . i do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though . i also like that the ride is smooth for victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright . the large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also .
0	i have only found one place to buy probe covers for this thing - so i bought a lot . they are n't the same manufacturer - but they are the exact type of probe covers . hope this helps others looking for covers for this . if the first years does n't sell probe covers for this anymore - they should n't let companies sell the thermometer either . http : //www.shoplet.com/office/db/g2512530.htm
1	after 2 nights of no sleep because our 18 months old son figured out how to flip himself out of the pack n play ( with just sheer upper body strength ! ) i was so relieved to find this crib tent and it was a pain to put together ( it took about 20 minutes ) but well worth it because it works ... he has stayed in the pack n play and did n't seem to care at all that he was `` trapped '' , i think kids do like the playfulness of a tent . my 4 year old was jealous ! there are a few downsides ... its a pain to set up and break down and if your using the pack n play for over nights and travel it is n't as portable as could be ... and i have an older pack n play , its from '02 when we had our first baby so the ends are higher than the sides so the clips have no where to clip onto but it has n't mattered . the side clips have been enough to keep our strong toddler in place . overall the product is expensive and a pain to set up but priceless because it lets the whole family sleep soundly and safely !
0	when your infant is crying because he 's hungry and you 're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed , you will not necessarily hear the very quiet `` click '' another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit . did it already cycle through once ? twice ? i do n't know . i never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and i was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out . yes , it was in plain sight , but that doesnt mean i caught it at the right time . what i do know is that leaving the bottle in there , reagrdless of it being 4oz . or 8oz. , makes the formula very hot . even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions . then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby . this went in the trash . the only reason i gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if i waited for water to boil . otherwise , i just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem
0	the item is sloppy looking and feeling , unlike the photo of the black ellaroo . i did n't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip . maybe i just never got it adjusted correctly but i read the instructions and gave it many tries . however , on a positive note , i was refunded my money with no problem . there was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front . so , i have no problem with the seller .
1	i love love loooooove this system ! i have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago . before this , i was pumping and storing in medela bottles , then transferring to playtex liners before feeding . then i had to wash all the medela bottles , plus playtex rings , etc . with this system , i just pump right into the liners . they are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go . i can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self-contained liners , instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm , plus a playtex system . overall , this has saved me several steps and less things to wash. for the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers - that is true . however , the liners themselves have ounce markings on them . just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner . easy ! i would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk ( if you store a lot of it ) . it would get too expensive for my tastes . i have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage . make sure you get two , because each box only comes with one pump adapter . highly recommended by one happy mamma
0	it 's a waste of money . you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet . if not , do n't buy it
0	we also ordered the bedding and got the pillow . we called baby age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding . they should know there 's a problem by now and change this listing
1	i purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training . i like that the top has a non-slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet . she really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty , it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training
1	this product is amazing . i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them ! ! super easy to clean and use . when ordering these , i was under the impression that there were 2 per package ... fyi-they 're not ! ! only one per ...
1	we were concerned about using a regular crib bumper for our tall toddler , but we needed something to keep his pacifiers in his crib at night . this crib bumper does the job . when he stands on it , it collapses , so it 's no help boosting him over the side . my one gripe ( which i 'm not sure there 's a way around ) is that there 's a gap between the front crib corners and the bumper that attaches to the front rail ( the one that slides up and down ) . because our little one is older , we put stuffed animals in the corners , but i 'm not sure how comfortable i 'd be using the bumper with an infant who might get her legs or arms caught
1	this product has really worked well for me ! my daughter used to love pushing her barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below ! now we do n't have to worry about this anymore . she ca n't reach her arm through these posts anymore either . i use window cleaner to clean the smudge
0	i 've never written a negative review ... if i could give this zero stars i would . first of all , it sinks the instant you put it in the tub ... like all the way to the bottom of the tub . the tag says to ring it out if it sinks ... hmmm ... how do you do that when your kid is in it ? second of all , it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub . i swear ... this is the worst baby product i 've ever owned ( and i 've owned a lot ) ... my 6mo son sits up great on his own , was slipping and sliding around in this , falling backwards , i had to hold him the entire time with both hands ... pathetic . do n't waste your money . tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat ... good grief
1	my daughter started with the baby bjorn stand alone potty seat - which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty . she quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat , so i ordered this baby bjorn toilet trainer and it has been fantastic . she quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug . it was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet . the seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty . it is also great for traveling . i would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas ( it really does fit any toilet ) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces ( i would carry a small container of disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom ) . i highly recommend this baby bjorn toilet trainer
1	i love this potty chair ! ! it is so simple , and that is what i like about it - simple to use simple to clean . my little boy loves it
1	i bought these sheets online since i could n't find any in the local babies r ' us store and did so with hesitation . but when i received them i could n't be happier with them . the best thing about these sheets , besides that they fit perfectly , is the velcro strips on the bottom of the sheets to insure they stay snug
1	i was a diehard graco fan . when my daughter was born 2002 the graco snugride was the top rated infant seat ( i put a lot of stock into what consumer reports has to say ) . the infant seat was great and we got it as part of the travel system . i loved both the stroller and seat , and was very sad when she outgrew the seat around 1 years old . i tried an eddie bauer convertible seat next and it was horrible , the straps always twisted and my daughter 's head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep . i quickly changed the graco comfortsport ( the one with the overhead drop down bar ) and she loved it . it had more padding , her head rested on the side of the carseat instead of her chest and the straps never twisted . it was easy to get in and out and not too heavy to lug around in airports . when she outgrew that seat i decided to make the switch to britax . although the roundabout was rate # 1 on cr i went with the marathon because the only thing cr did n't like about it was the infant latch ( which i would n't need as my child was 3yrs old ) and it had a higher weight limit than the roundabout . i own a honda accord 4 door and my husband drives a 4 door toyota echo ( tiny ) . the seat fits perfectly well in both vehicles in the forward facing position . the toyota has latch and the honda does n't but in both cars it does n't move . partly due to the fact that my husband is excellent at installing and partly due to the car seats weight . it is quite heavy , and it can be a pain to haul around airports . my husband usually just loosens the straps and wears it like a backpack through the airport . my daughter loves it , ( we have a girly print , not the granite ) it has plenty of room for her , she never is uncomfortable sleeping in it ( her head does n't sit on her chest either ) , and though she 's a very bright 4 year old she 's never been able to get out of the seat . i love the fact that she can be in it until she 's 65lbs with the five point restraint and the straps never twist . britax also does thoughtful things like adding velcro on the sides of the seat to hold the straps in place when you 're putting your child in and having a padded area under the clip so your child is n't burned by the hot plastic in the summer ( or freezing in the winter ) . i plan on staying with britax from here on out
0	who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child . this gate is all look and no function . it looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it . if you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work . i was finally able to use the thing only after i bought four # 8-32 x 1 3/4 '' long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together . i did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6 '' then drilling two holes about 4 '' apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together . it works ! but it 's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something . good luck ! !
0	the colors are very diferent , they supposed to be blue , yellow and white , and i recived in a pale yellow . the material is not very good . i do n't recomend this product .
1	diaper genie stage 2 refills have helped us eliminate odors in our twins room . easy to install and discard . our one year old twins use a lot of diapers and they have been eating solid foods for 6 months . but you have to install them tightly on the diaper genie . if the refill wabbles on its place , then you need to see what 's wrong before starting using it . otherwise the odors will come out . the real fact is that it works ! ! . and you know , its great to be at home with my twins in their room and have everything tidy . we used to throw the diapers in the bathroom garbage can , but after a few hours we could n't stand going in there . note : i am the father , and just spend a couple of hours a day with them ... my wife could tell you more on how she loves this diaper genie
0	i wanted something thick and soft so my baby could n't feel the plastic under his sheet . this one is so thin you can almost see through it . there is hardly any quilting . another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on . it is a safe fit , and washes well . i ment to give it 3 stars
0	a great idea , but very time-consuming to put on . my advice is to use a regular maya type sling for the first few months , and then get the patapum . it 's the least pricey of the `` structured '' carriers which are the only ones that put the weight on your hips , rather than your shoulders , and therefore spare your spine .
1	she really enjoyed tummy time on this mat..loves watching the fish and has toys that she can reach and grab
1	this is really a great product . i ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks . it took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time , but once i got the hang of it it 's very easy to use . it comes in two pieces ; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle . i have n't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she has n't tried to mouth the handle . she is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she does n't mind it a bit . she is very comfortable and can look around and i 'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart . i 'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it .
1	our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home . when we tried to transition him to the crib , he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly . as he outgrew the stroller , we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib ( lots of attempts - not an easy task ! ! ) . he 's 5 1/2 months old and we now use the sleep nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized swaddleme at night . he loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly . the sleep nest is small enough to be cozy , but large enough for him to move comfortably . it fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go
1	i use it while my daughter is lying down . she loves being in the tub . this just makes her float . it 's great as the get bigger to use like the ring . would buy for a friend and totally recommend !
0	as a nursing mother i researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition . i read from so many sources that soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies . i bought a starter kit and several other bottles . i was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that i purchased only one did not leak . i tried repositioning the nipple and i tried to tighten the lid . nothing helped . my son was soaked everytime we tried to use them . i switched to another brand and now we are very dry
1	perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome . for the price , it has alot to offer . it has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks , moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes . it 's not the plushest stroller , however , for travel or quick errands it 's perfect for us
1	i bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it . the extra extensions you can buy for it are great . i have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room . i found it to be very durable and sturdy . when my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in . as he got a little older and became more mobile i set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set . you can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose . i would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though . it 's sturdy but probably not for that age . it can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside . i 'd recommend this highly
1	i loved this product . my baby slept in it until she was able to turn over . she resisted swaddling , and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib . i agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful , particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down .
1	we purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters . the pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate . this gate is well worth the money . the remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it , except for the 13 month old of course . it is so much easier for everyone . with all of the use our gate gets , the spot welds broke one day . you really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again . i called customer support , concerned because i do longer had my receipt or even the box . the spot welds breaking loose was a problem they had n't had reported before ( so this apparently is n't a common problem ! ) i was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured . i was very impressed ! i will be sure to check out evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products for their customer support alone . service like that is not so common anymore . like i said , great concept and service
1	i love this pump ! if you 're going to breastfeed , you need this pump . it 's expensive , but worth the investment . i pump at least 10 times a week and it 's just so much easier than the manual pump i tried .
0	like so many others have said , this was a great gate right up until it broke . each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place . we are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years , the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use . each time a gate has broken we 've pondered what to do because we do n't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing , but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs . argh ! ! !
1	our baby was born in early october and we put the bundleme on her carrier immediately . we live in chicago and have had warm weather ( 75 degrees ) and cold weather ( 10 below ) since then . we love this cover . the top easily zips off for those rare warm days or if we are strolling though the mall . it also has kept her very warm and toasty on cold windy days . the day when it was 10 below freezing , she was zipped up in the cover with only a winter hat on and your typical outfit . i was concerned for her warmth , but when we unzipped her she was as toasty warm as could be . we have not had to buy a winter jacket . it has also kept her dry through a couple of rain storms . i have gotten numerous compliments on this cover ( almost every time we take her out ) and it still looks like new , even though many things have gotten spilled on it . i would highly recommend this product
0	and had problems with it from the beginning . the cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached . evenflo did replace it after i sent pictures . the shade protector does n't stay up . i had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter . i wish i had checked safety ratings and reviews before i purchased this product .
1	i researched many breast pumps on line before my daughter was born . after she was two weeks old , and my milk supply was established , i decided to purchase a pump . i had read many reviews about isis and was so skeptical ... and i did n't want to pay $ 300 for an automatic one . i enjoy breastfeeding so much , however , i am not comfortable nursing in public not to mention pumping allows my husband to feed her too . after much thought , i decided to purchase the isis & amp ; quot ; back to work & amp ; quot ; . it came with the pump , bottles and the tote ( which by the way is very discreet ) . i had no trouble assembling it at all . from the first time i used isis i 've had great success . i am able to pump several ounces in 15 minutes , without any pain or discomfort as i control the suction . our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all , nor have we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking . i assemble the pump and the nipples/rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet . i love how easy this is to use and i do n't have to find a place to plug it in at work . the only thing i 've noticed is that the little gel packs do n't stay cool enough for my liking so i went and purchased 2 little ice packs ( .90 cents ) and they work like a charm ! i would recommend this to any mom !
1	i have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table , and i like both for different reasons . the disposable ones are sort of expensive , but very portable when i am flying and visiting relatives . the hippo one is great to grab and go around town , when i am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag . i have had waiters thank me at many restaurants ! just fold the mess right up and clean at home ! my son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it , and i do n't want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs . this hippo is really durable too , i have used this same mat for over 3 years , ( i first got it for my daughter ) and it still looks great
0	looked nice at the store . thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch ... until we got home and tried to use it . the head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat , the velcro is not strong enough . i would not buy this product again
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it ... the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it . i keep all of the `` out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~ ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff ... also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be !
0	when i learned i was expecting triplets , i bought a large inventory of these bottles which i thought were the best out there . boy , was i wrong ! these bottles leak , not just once in a while but with almost every feeding . i am constantly `` double checking '' them in hopes they wo n't leak all over my babies . i now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they do n't get soaked when - surprise ! - the bottle leaks all over them . yes , i 've read the directions and no , i do n't over tighten the bottles . you ca n't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag . they are especially leaky when i prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator . there is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal . the bottle must be disassembled , the top wiped dry and then reassembled . lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings . even if i am doing something wrong , a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product . if i had n't bought so many , i 'd throw them all away and get something else . take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation
1	this chair is a great space saver . attaches easily to the chair , has two cup holders and the tray is the size of a normal high chair . the draw back is it 's hard to adjust the seat for the infant . was able to with some effort
0	i used this when i became too sore to use my electric pump . the milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes . i would n't even say getting this as a pump for when you 're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up . i had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing ( which it says you can do ) . they do n't sell just that one little piece so i had to buy the actual pump again as a part . it cost nearly $ 30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it . the entire system just is n't durable or made for much use . also , cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible .
1	out of all the loads of baby gear i bought- this is by far the best money i spent . i thought , its a little spendy , but super cute . after my preemie came home the 3rd week of november and it was 27 degrees ... i realized how great this thing was . its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm . no need for a jacket that would mess up her straps ! also in the wind and the rain , to just be able to flip it over her face is so great ! this is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion . my daughter will be able to use it well into spring . not to mention , not a day goes by that i do n't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where i got it . love it love it
1	these placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table , especially for when you 're out in public places . they stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at ( my son is obsessed with anything sesame street - esp elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat ) . they 're easy to fit into any purse , diaper bag , pocket so they 're always accessible .
0	there are so many other sling out there . do n't waste your timeor money on this . i hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot . it was also impossible to adjust . i got a couple of slings from www.equanimitybaby.com and one from www.peppermint.com and love these . bottom line , check out the other options , this one is a waste of $ $ $
1	we struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco . the first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless . i ca n't explain how delighted my wife and i were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby . it was better than christmas morning when we were kids ! ! ! we have wireless internet , cell phones , cordless phones , basically if its electronic we got it . despite all the potential for interfence the graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference . a must buy for any parent
1	i love this item . it really works well in february winter weather . i bought 4 snowsuits and i have n't used one for our newborn because snowsuits are tedious . i am able to put her in her car seat , put a blanket inside and put a hat on her . forget the suits and mittens . i cover her with the cover and she sleeps in the dark and warmth soundly . also , it prevents people from touching her all of the time because they ca n't see her when i cover her up . the only problem is that this item did n't fit well with the newest peg perego infant car seats . i made it work , but it does n't fit perfectly . it worked with the old peg perego car seat , but not the newest one . i loved this item so much that i 've made it work , though . it is n't perfect , but it works . it actually is so much better than peg perego 's cover , which came with the car seat . this cover has made my life pretty easy . i found it easy to put on the peg perego . i love the color . it zips up easily . it is soft . isabella seems to like to snuggle in it . it is comfy for her . be aware , though , i live in salt lake city , ut . our winters are mild . if you have colder winters , you may want to add a snowsuit . still , it is worth the money ! i am glad i bought it .
1	if anyone asked me what baby product i would have to have it would be this product ! i love it and it is very comfortable to use . one negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well , so do n't let your child use it because they could slip . i would purchase it again and would give it as a gift
1	we got our maclaren stroller a few weeks ago . we love it . my husband and i are both tall ~ me 5'7 '' and him 6'1 '' . both of us can use this stroller without slouching or kicking the wheels when we walk . the stroller folds and unfolds easily and maneuvers beautifully . i highly recommend this stroller to anyone who is taller and wants a convenient stroller .
0	great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction . it would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table ... really
1	our grandson reciently came to live with us , nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty . the day our 1st pott arrived i opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help . about 15 minutes later i noticed drake had been very quiet.as i searched the house for him i discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! he is now doing very well with his training ! the product is well constructed , easy to to set up , and easy to use
0	i was excited when i purchased this ear thermometer because i had an ear thermometer years ago that i loved . i was unfortunately very disappointed with this one 's performance . the temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase . then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever . i could feel that she was burning up , but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when i checked it ( twice ) . i got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1 ! ! ! needless to say this thermometer went back to the store . i wo n't buy another ear thermometer until i can afford to get a better brand , like the one i had years ago ( thermoscan ) . : o
0	i am so perplexed at the popularity of this item ! when it first came out , i purchased one for my son ( he was around six months old at the time ) . he immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back , extending his arms behind him , and straightening his legs , so i returned it . by the time i had my second child ( a girl ) , bumbomania had kicked in , and these seats were everywhere . i began to think that my son 's experience was a fluke , and i purchased another one for my daughter . low and behold , she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the exact same way ! so i returned the second bumbo as well , but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children `` may '' be able to get out of the seat . in conclusion , although the bumbo may work great for some - beware ! if you have little houdinis like i do , this product is simply not safe
0	this item is packaged very poorly . you have to literally rip the box apart to open it . i did this twice , and both times the very last item was completely cracked in half . very inconveniently shipped and packaged .
1	i had checked out booster seats on the internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive . it 's a bargain -- well made and easy to use . my grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair . the seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair . when i wrote customer service about the problem , they sent a whole new booster seat
1	would someone be able to give me the dimensions/measurements for this mattress ? thanks so much ! i do not have this-however it made me put in a rating in order to post a question ...
0	this was the first bottle i purchased for my daughter when she was born . i was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice , i had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life ! i had the worst time with this bottle ! it leaked everytime i went to shake it and whenever i would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast . she would also gag and had horrible gas ! i stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and i thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better . it ended up being the same problems again ! ! i switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great ! i would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding ! my daughter did not get confused and she did not drown in formula ! even though it is a little more work with the drop in system , i dont care ! i can push the air out of the bottle and she swallows less air and she has less gas and spits up less !
0	i accidentally ordered this one instead of the kolcraft universal carrier , since they are both called the universal carrier . this car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary . rather than returning it , my husband wanted to eat the $ 59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat . we went out and purchased the kolcraft universal carrier -- it is much simpler , easier to fold , and has a large , functional basket underneath the car seat .
1	the hello kitty chair was just adorable , the quality and craftmanship is outstanding . my 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it on christmas morning and knew just how to start rocking . its just the right size . thank yo
0	i could not get this mirror to angle properly in our honda cr-v to give a view of the baby , and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test , the image of the baby was so small that i could discern no details about what the baby was doing . the mirror is also distorting . the image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look directly into the center of the mirror .
0	okay , for starters , i did look at the various other reviews and thought i would take my chance . it seemed the good outweighed the bad . until ... i bought it and am trying to install it ( as we speak but got irritated so am taking a break to write this . ) where to begin , the locking mechanism seems to be fine if you can get it to install in the first place . however , the manufacter only includes screws for wood walls . which mean , if you dont have wood walls you have to go buy other screws ! i have drywall and the screws are not reliable . second , i bought this gate with the extension ( 24 '' , the only one there is ) because the top of my stairs measure 44 1/2 inches . this gate is supposed to fit that with the extension . it doesnt . i have tried for over an hour to get it to fit and it doesnt fit even with the extension . it would without the extension however there is about a 5 inch gap from the wall to the bolts on each side and that is with the bolts all the way unscrewed also . needless to say if i want this gate to work , i have to go to my local hardware store and buy new hardware so this will mount securly or i have to take it back to the store and find something else . unless i can figure out a way to make it fit how it is , this gate has been a waste of my time and my money . the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because im sure it would be just fine if i had wood walls and it fit to where i can install it . now i have holes in my wall and confussion trying to figure out how to make it fit if its at all possible . doesnt look like it is though .
1	these are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself . whenever we are out at a restaurant i just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table . who knows what they wipe those tables with ? ! this is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on
1	i highly recommend this item . as soon as your little one can sit up on his own , this is a must have for all moms . it fits all shopping carts ( except costco , but including target ) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants . it keeps baby ( and mommy 's hands ) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart . a must have ! this is the gift i give at baby showers . i 've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach . still looks good
1	my daughter was the most happy when she was in her halo . i love these sleep blankets , the cotton ones for use in florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece . i wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits . i recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep , your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers
1	baby size : my daughter started out at just over 5 lbs , and this seat fit her well from the beginning . the straps have adjusted easily as she 's rapidly grown , i have n't had the adjustment problems other reviewers had . the head support worked well too ( at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head ) . a baby 's head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat , but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily . the seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats ( like my toyota camry ) because of this angle requirement , but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue . portability : i love the stay-in-car base , which i found easy to install properly . it 's also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out , and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not . an extra base is great for families with multiple cars , as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go . the carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car , but i find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs ( and i 'm fairly strong ) . it will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart , but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion ; i just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket . the snap n ' go stroller is great if you 're taking this seat farther from your car . it 's much more lightweight than the large `` travel system '' graco also sells with this seat . it 's easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push , but a little too short if you 're much taller than 6 ft. durability : i ca n't comment on the seat 's lifespan , as we 've only been using it a little over 2 months . a few times i have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned , but it does n't happen often . the canopy seems rather flimsy to me , but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller , so it has n't been an issue so far . other considerations : windsor seems to be a fairly gender-neutral pattern , if this matters to you . my baby wears a lot of yellow clothes , and people seem to assume she 's a boy about 60 % of the time when she 's in this seat . the carrier handle has several different positions : up for carrying , flat for carseat use , and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble . with the handle left up , the `` wobble-enabled '' carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts . i would buy this seat again . its only drawbacks are its weight ( probably unavoidable since it 's a carseat and must be sturdy ) and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling ( but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem )
0	i bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he could n't turn around and see the world . i hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move . the seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there is n't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable ) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby could n't move around . i did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear . the seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . ( note : there is a $ 5 return charge . )
0	we had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart . i chose this one because of its features and colors . my daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it . we tried for days to get her to use this , but she never would . so , we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves .
1	we have been swaddling our 8 week old since she came home from the hospital . we tried the swaddle me , but i guess she was too small ( 7 lbs . ) we were using the miracle blanket which we loved . however , as she got stronger , she was able to kick and squirm her way out . i got worried about her safety with a loose blanket in the crib , but she really liked being swaddled . i took out the swaddle me that i received at a shower and decided to try it again . it worked like a champ , and she is sleeping 7 hours at night now ! ! i stretch it so that it 's as tight as possible . i bought another one , and the velcro for the feet is bigger - even better to hold it down . we love it and highly recommend !
1	this product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night , especially since she ca n't kick off the blankets . i highly recommend it . sizing is different than baby r us . i 'm probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought i 'd provide info . x-small ( newborn ) 5 to 10 lbs small ( up to 6 months ) 10 to 18 lbs medium ( 6-12 months ) 16 to 24 lbs large ( 12-18 months ) 22 to 28 lbs x-large ( 18-24 months ) 26 to 36 lb
1	this seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained . for starters , kids like using the same seat as mom and dad..this seat allows them to do that comfortably . it is not too big and not too small , fits any toilet and travels like a dream . as the mom of a boy , i do n't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat , but even for boys this seat is mess free . and with boys , there is usually a little mess , but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily . i love it , and my son loves it . i wish i had n't bought the potty because my son refuses to use it..only this seat
0	i bought this sling when i was still pregnant . after my son was born i tried putting him in it but he just did n't seem secure , so i threw it in the back of the closet . when he turned one , i dug it out again , thinking it would work well as a hip carrier , but it is even worse for this ! i had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful . first of all , the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone , it is very painful with a heavier baby . i took him out of it and will never touch the thing again
0	bought this crib tent after reading all the `` fine print '' about returns . besides , toilet seats etc . which allegro medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons , allegro medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days . not when i tried to return this . allegro medical said all returns were `` up to their discretion '' . they would not allow me to return this despite the fact i did n't even open the box . very misleading will never buy from allegro medical again
0	my wife and i purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child , and after using it for almost 2 weeks i could not be more disappointed . we were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in , but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage . this is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors , but you certainly do n't get what you pay for here . pros : 1 . you do get a clear connection when the unit is in range ( see cons for a further explanation ) cons : 1 . the biggest complaint i have is the battery life . even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting , you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge . you will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge . this is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night . the nursery unit is even worse , as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 aaa batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in . why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me . basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times . 2 . i have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit . they just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range . this required a couple of off/on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct . 3 . the range is not ideal . i have a 2800 square foot , 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit . granted , the units were about as far away as they can be in our house , but considering this distance was only about 60 feet , i do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house . 4 . as other reviewers have noted , the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper . since the speaker is always on , you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit . several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume ( i.e . if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib ) . also the leds are also extremely bright in a dark room . unfortunately i can not recommend this product . we are making due with it simply because i refuse to throw away a $ 100 baby monitor , although i 'm sure i would be much happier with a different product . if you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time , then this product would probably suffice , although i 'm sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well
1	put together well with a nice assortment of items in the bag , nice gift all by itself for the expectant mo
0	this stroller was great for a year and a half . my only complaint until now was the sunshade ... . it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded ... but i could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is . it 's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact . however , now i am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use . it does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old , so its not related to weight . every time it 's happened i have been right there , so there have been no injuries , but i am leary to put my children in it now . i contacted chicco and was told , `` sorry , you are out of warranty '' their products carry a 1 year warranty , and i purchased mine a year and a half ago . i only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own , ... .. otherwise i would try to give it no stars . every mom wants to feel that their child is safe , and i am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller
1	this is excellent ! i pump in my car while at work and this is the best idea ever . nice long cord allows you to pump in the backseat for privacy . a must have
0	i am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors . the battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so i ca n't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery . and it does n't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it . i have to keep it on the charger all night so it does n't go out . there is tons of static and extra noise . also , the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if i bend down to much . just super dissapointed with these monitors - absolutely not worth its big price tag ! ! please look elsewhere - do not recommend !
0	buy the baby bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk . no matter how i tried , i could n't wrap my baby to where i felt he was secure and safe and comfortable . plus , it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me . by the time he was in , he wanted out
0	this is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and do n't stick to my son 's highchair at all . very disappointing
0	initially , i thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so i put different sizes into our registry . however , when our baby girl ( 1 week old ) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle , it did not come out . my husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions . he thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple , so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out . he finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does . the hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released . baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole . for a newborn infant , it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only . luckily we had two avent bottles ( with the traditionally hole idea ) so she is doing very well with the avent bottles and she still loves them a lot . we ended up returning the unused ventair bottles and got a lots of avent bottles but still stuck with the opened ones . i do not recommend these 'difficult ' bottles for newborn . baby should not need to 'think ' how to get the milk out . for leaking problem , we do not have any issue with the avent bottles . when it leaks , it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed ( push all the way though the ring ) or the ring has not been tightly screwed . we also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle , you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer . it is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring , nipples and the bottle neck . this works 99 % for us with no leak . we are the fans of the avent bottles .
1	i originally bought this bag for a trip to disney world . it held everything great , stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack . although i was not using it to carry children 's gear , i carried an umbrella , 3 bottles of water , granola bars , sun glasses , cellphone , keys , wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great ! i am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag , it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far
1	i got this tray for my son 's daily rides in the car , and it has been terrific ! he can eat on it , put his sippy cup into the cup holder , and be totally independent . he can also play on it - cars , crayons , etc. , and it holds his books too . after approximately 9 months of constant use , it cracked . ( it is very stiff , of course , but i do n't recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked ) . worth the money as far as i am concerned .
1	my 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair . he does n't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair . the babybjorn is a bit expensive . i found a similar chair at ikea for a fraction of the cost .
0	we actually went through two of these in two weeks . the first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes , so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective . the second one did the exact same thing ! we wasted so many wipes with this warmer , since they were `` cooked '' . we have even emailed the company and sent them pictures , but never heard back from them . save your money
1	finally ! the joovy is the best double stroller out there -- it was just missing one key element : a cup holder/organizer for parents . well , here it is ! i would imagine these will eventually be included with the stroller , but for now- if you buy the stroller- this is a must
1	i love this product ! i works graet as a barrier between your little one and whatever surface he or she is on ( e.g . a car seat , high chair , stroller etc. ) . it really saves you from having to wash your furniture when the little one has bathroom accidents that leak out of their diapers . it is great for any aged baby/infant/toddler . it will really make your life easier . i highly recommend it
1	my son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby . we have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle . lastnight we bought this terrific cup and he has not asked for the bottle yet ! i will now be putting the bottles away for good this time ! i will be ordering a few more so we always have one on hand . they are pricey , but if i would n't have bought all the other cups , i 'd have had plenty of money saved just by buying these in the first place !
1	it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks . i have searched the web and ca n't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing does n't look quite as good with a brush that does n't match .
0	monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan on using the ac adapter ... .. fisher price customer service recommends that the ac adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and/or unit will be damaged . in my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the ac adapter -- you 'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing ! ( the fisher price rep actually told me i 'd `` fry it '' ) .
1	i love this bath tub ! we were not happy with my son 's infant bath tub , so we were anxious to move into this one ! it fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs . when you 're done with it , it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry . the best part is that we 'll be able to deflate it and store it easily . it 's also great for traveling
1	i love this blanket so much let me count the ways ... ( 1 ) certified organic ( so hard to find ) , ( 2 ) large enough for a good , tight swaddle ( for a good night sleep ) , ( 3 ) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket ( even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse ) , ( 4 ) soft , soft , and softer with every wash ! i just love this blanket and i feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ultimate - and i know he loves it too
0	i bought this item for my daughter and it is not worth the money . the items are cheap plastic and some are even cardboard . this would be a great deal if offered at the dollar store . pass
1	i got four of these sleepsacks , two fleece and two cotton . i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes , but it did n't effect the product . they are wonderful . if you are buying for a newborn , get the 6-12 month size , since it 'll last a bit longer . i ended up giving away the 0-6 month size , when my baby was only 3 months old , as it was getting a bit small .
1	i have used medela 's pump in style advance for 4 months now after having my first baby . this pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing i bought in 2006 . why i gave this item 5-star ratings : - 1 ) it helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding . i am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till i have to get back to work again . so it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going . 2 ) this pump is comfortable to use and i can regulate the speed which is suitable for me . the medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash sterilise . 3 ) it never breakdown ever ! for 4 months now , and i 'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day . i bring this unit to the office and also whenever i am travelling . it is very mobile , although a little heavy to carry . 4 ) it has a battery pack which is handy whenever i am in a place without power-supply . 5 ) i bought this online in amazon for usd $ 319 . but in malaysia , this unit would have cost myr1800 ( usd $ 500 ) . just a note for non-us users ( like myself ) , you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump . this can be easily obtained from any electrical shops . this is a good buy , if you 're looking for a pump , then you have found it !
1	the mom who received this gift was very pleased with it
0	i bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born . it is awful ! it gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1 , when in fact i know that she has a fever ! i bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings . do n't buy this , its a waste of time and $ $ $ $ $ $
0	1. they leak 2. too expensive 3. they do n't supply enough lids , so you have to buy more containers 4. does n't work well for feedin
0	my daughter really loves this bus . whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it . she plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them . the bad thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up . my daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm . but since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since .
0	well , we ordered this for a trip and it 's `` delayed '' even though it says it 's in stock . we got a vauge email that says `` delayed '' but no promise of delivery ... . do n't order it from amazon if you 're exhausted chasing an escaping baby ! go to a local store and purchase it ... ... ..waiting ... ... .waiting ... ... .waiting ... ...
0	my husband and i purchased this set with my first son , but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son . the difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks , sometimes more than that . it is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling . i hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings
0	i found all of the avent cups really hard to clean ! i could n't get the stopper out of the top of the cup . the playtex cups are way easier to use !
1	this is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks- i had more leaks with disposables . we are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes . i am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth , and delighted with the ease of use of this product .
0	we bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby . while he had no problems using the playtex nursers , he ended up having a problem with dr. brown 's natural flow bottles . first off , they are a pain to clean . each piece needs to be painstakenly washed ( boiling the nipple , washing the bottle , and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir . ) it was certainly laborsome and time consuming . anyhow , when he uses them , he spits up where he did n't with the competition . i tried to figure out why . if you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking . so my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product . he lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much . needless to say , we are planning to return these and will stick with playtex
1	based upon reviews , i decided to go with dr. brown 's from the start . we 've been very happy with them ! a friend had given me some avent bottles she had never used so i decided to try them compare . my baby had a terrible tummy ache had never before burped so much . those avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust . for folks who complain about leakage ... .the rare times that has happened to me was when i accidentally added milk past the top marker . otherwise , i 've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage . another plus is that they 're very easy to clean ; i just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher ( i use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces ) . if you 're comparing the wide mouth to the standard , forget the standard ! they 're a pain to get liquid into ( but still good bottles ) . i absolutely love this product would never consider another bottle
1	my first son had a race car bed which was n't made very well . we moved him to a big bed when our second child was ready for the toddler bed . well , we decided to get rid of the old car bed and get him his own thomas bed for his 2nd birthday since he is obsessed with thomas . best decision ever ! it is so much better made that the other plastic beds ! and i 'm so glad i read the reviews ... the springs from the crib fits perfectly in the thomas bed ( and it 's pretty strong because i can lay in the bed with him at night if i have to ) . it is really worth the money . if you are looking into a cute toddler bed for a boy , i 'd skip the other cute beds and go straight to this one ! we all love it
0	very useless pants . i bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and i did buy the correct size . they even leaked when used over diapers at night . they bascially do nothing
0	this product was a big disappointment for us . our baby was always covered in sweat after sleeping on the polyster based sheet . he was most uncomfortable in his sleep and his back would be wet with sweat . definetly not recommend this one
1	we got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it . we have a graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice . you can hardly hear her on it . the baby quiet sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly . the receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use . our graco does that too so i do n't know if that is the norm with monitors . the sound is the best when pluged in . the nightlight is great . the humidity function i have not figured out as of yet . it say 's it is 19 % in every room and i do n't know that is correct . the temp works fine . i have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works . i like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time . i have n't used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful . over all - like my choice in the monitor .
1	it 's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier . this product solves that problem ! and it 's cute too . i was shopping at babys 'r ' us recently and the sales girl asked where i got my `` super cute '' diaper bag/carrier . i told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item ( no word yet on whether or not they will ) . i have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts . it 's the ultimate in convenience and fashion
1	every mother/father should definitely purchase a baby monitor . until this came i could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not . the receiver side is battery operated , so even if i walk around the house i can here my baby . even the smallest sound is picked up ! amazing . i have n't tried other monitors , but this one is perfect and inexpensive , so i would recommend it to anyone
1	i do n't know what the reviewers before me were talking about . i use this at kroger , giant eagle and target and do n't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store . it 's sturdy , and easy to use . do n't pass this one up
1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame . i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down . i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was . once he was walking , he did n't use it again
1	whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler . my grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity . yes , activity . at a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving ; no moving , no peek-a-boos ! it contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby . a good value at any price
0	i have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers . if i install this lock , the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening . it also means that i would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet . i 'm returning it
0	do n't buy this stroller . the only good thing about it is that you wo n't be sad if you leave it somewhere . the `` restraints '' do n't restrain at all . my one year old twins barely stay in it so when we 're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things . ( not safe ) the stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and i mean barely fits . it does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear . the `` adult drink cup holder '' snaps off when struggling to go through doors and i do n't have to describe what a mess that is . i 'm just lucky i do n't drink hot coffee ; otherwise i would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children . there is no storage . the `` saddle bags '' can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you do n't mind the children being able to reach . this stroller is not only a nuisance , it has potentially dangerous features , so please do n't buy it
1	i was very cautious with my first child concerning the crib . nothing was inside except the sheets and baby . as you can imagine , this led to many sleepless nights of baby waking due to legs and arms getting tangled in the rails . so , number two baby reaped the benefit of me not being such an over-cautious parent and utalizing this wonderful bumper ! i still worry about sids but i feel this bumper has allowed for many restful nights for baby and mommy . highly recommend
1	this gate us a lifesaver . not only do i pets , i have a very adventurus toddler . this gate is sturdy and very durable . it is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight . my living room has a curve to it so it fits great . a wonderful item . thank you
0	this is the worst nursing pad that i 've tried . it slips out of place , and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it . i found myself with wet bras all the time ! these pads are terrible ! i recommend the lansinoh brand .
0	we received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago ( i was registered at babies r us ) . my first child used it for a little over 2 years . my second child has used it for nearly 2 years . neither child is big ( in fact , one is rather petite ) . even though the mattress was not abused , it cracked and ripped in numerous places . i 'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty ' policies from kolkraft . i do n't recommend this mattress .
0	i bought this potty seat for my daughter and i took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets . the second i put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet ! the seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets , that is a lie . my toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through . a waste of money and a safety hazard
0	so i recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though i did n't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we 're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it does n't stick to the wall . at first i thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower , but oh no that 's not it at all . then i thought maybe it was that i had something too heavy inside when really all i had were some rubber rings and i think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon . but yet again , the darn thing came un-stuck . so basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you did n't register for , investigate whether or not it 's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return . literally .
1	the first time i used this excersaucer i was at my sister-in-laws house and she advised to put my six month old in it . at first i was hesitant because i thought it looked too high and kind of unsturdy , compared to my excersaucer deluxe and my excersaucer 3in1 . i did end up putting daireeann in it and she loved it so much that i bought one two days later to take to my after baptism party at a restaurant where i might add was so compact that she did not get bumped into at all . the only thing is mine did not come with a musical pad at the bottom . just a little tip , if you bend the bar back a little bit it will not bump the babies head and the mirror can be flipped facing a way from the baby . i do recommend this one and trust me i am very picky when it comes to my kids so this is a good choice
0	the size stated 3-6 months . the baby was 2 months old and the hat was too small . anyone ordering should consider it runs very small . then because i used my credit card to purchase it i was unable to return it and get a refund
0	before i even had the opportunity to use this product , it has disappointed me . i have washed this item per the manufacturer 's instructions . the bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled . i wonder how many more washings this pad can stand . truly a disappointment
0	we have the all clear swing gate ( hardware-mounted , not pressure-mounted ) installed at the top of our basement stairs . earlier this evening , i opened the lock , and as the gate swung out over the stairs , the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand . fortunately , enough of my weight was behind me that i was able to correct my balance ( just ! ) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs . but it was a close thing . an inch or a pound or a second either way and i -- or , god forbid , one of our children -- would certainly have been badly injured . while i was taking a photograph of the broken hinge , the gate itself , which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge , fell off and tumbled down the stairs . the gate has been in place for six weeks , but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks . nb this was a product failure , not an installation fault . the screws are still firmly attached to the wall , along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge . i purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here , but after my experience tonight , i would not recommend that anybody buy this gate , ever . ( the review gives one star , because no stars is not an option ) . and i would expect to see a product recall very soon
1	we waited until our daughter was [ ... ] to get her this , and it 's fantastic ! she 's now [ ... ] and it 's in storage , but she was using it until she was about [ ... ] i like that the height is adjustable , the springs are covered , and the seat comes out easily to wash it . ( it was a poop-eroo for us too . ) a few things that i learned using this though is : the blue spinning toy does n't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it . it is incredibly hard to clean . the one that i got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in , so once the batteries died , we set the kangaroo part aside . my daughter 's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it . i recommend using a pair of robeez , or at very least a pair of socks , to protect their feet
1	these are the best pads for the task ... the ultra thin pads are great for during the day ... they dont leak and are very breathable ... the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking . i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads . the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar . try every kind you get ... samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best .
1	we have 2 kids in a 2-bedroom apartment . when our 2nd child was born , we put him in our bedroom . there is not much space there , so this portable crib was a great find ! we use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it . pros : saves space , folds , easy to move from room to room ( on wheels ) , really easy to change the sheets ( compared to regular crib with heavy matress ) . it also has very neutral color and style , so it fits really well with other traditional furniture . cons : the baby will outgrow it in about 1 year , the matress is extremely thin ( about 1 inch ! ) . we bought an extra matress ( the normal thickness ) for about $ 20 . to find it , do a search for `` portable crib matress ''
0	hard to install , ridiculously confounding installation directions , and when you 're done , it 's flimsy . do n't waste your money
0	the kneeling stool is great . the padding is sufficient and i love that it flips over to convert to a stool ... very useful ! but ... the elbow pad is a joke ! there is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic . not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all . it constantly pops off the tub whenever i put any weight on it . i do n't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great . i suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews , you try to find it used so that you do n't have to pay retail
0	i was really hopeful about this diaper bag when i ordered it through amazon . the size is small and convenient , but i found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck . also , the clasp broke after i had it for only 2 weeks ! i am really disappointed , and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag .
0	this seat is very dangerous and set my daughter 's potty training back months . the seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it ! thank goodness i was still holding her ! she did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after ! potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse ! the only reason i gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one
0	we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good . the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out , i 'd hit it and knock it out of place , so i had to readjust it all over again . sometimes when we 'd hit bumps , it would fall and become worthless . finally , my little girl 's arms got long enough that she could reach it , and it ended up breaking .
0	this is a great idea , however if your crib has anything larger than a jenny lind style piece of wood on it , it wo n't work . we do n't have a sleigh style crib , but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch . it would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days
0	this does not fold down 90 deg . do n't buy if you think you 'll be able to fold down and change sheets or something
1	we bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly . this one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again . i also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean .
0	i bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods . ten months later , i hardly ever use the darn thing . it worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases . my complaints with the product : - not particularly sturdy . the backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily . - the straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way . not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere . however , everytime i remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear . and unfortunately it seems i need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured ( another complaint ) . - the second tray which pops on over the swing away tray ( at least on my particular model ) is very easily removed by my son . he lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor . the point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably . - this seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat . it has to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over . the good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space . it is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design . overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites . if i had it to do over , i would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand
1	i have had great success with this manual pump . my best advice if you are having trouble is to take out the petals ! ! ! this helped me immensely . milk was getting sucked under the silicone and my i was getting rubbed by the narrowed opening . i took out the petals and the milk started to flow down into the bottle and pumping became a lot more comfortable and effective . i used this pump for 2 kids and never had a silicone disk tear on me . i highly recommend this pump
1	this sensor is all about peace of mind . we 've been using it for a few weeks now and it 's gone off twice - scaring us , but making us glad that we have it . both times that its gone off , our daughter has been very tightly swaddled , so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm . you can change the sensitivity on it , but the default setting should be fine . there is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear . my husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes . it is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise . it does take some getting used to - you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib , otherwise the sensor will go off . but this `inconvenience ' is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you . i believe they sell this with only one parent unit - but you really want to get two . leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile - we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room , to the living room , etc . this sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny .
0	i have thrown this thing more than once trying to put it together ! i have never had so much trouble with any of my daughter 's other contraptions . i guess i 'll have to sic my husband on it
0	i bought two for my kids ' seats . they constantly bunch up and slip around . now i have to lose money in shipping to send them back for a refund . do n't bother with these . just fold up a towel . it will be cheaper and just as convenient as these things
0	with our knobs being on the front of the stove , these covers hung down over the oven door , and either got in the way , or were popped off on a regular basis ( or pulled off by our 16 month old ) . we found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop was n't in use
1	after reading all the horror stories , we were leary to purchase but decided to well in advance of our child 's birth . we recieved the armoire within 2 weeks of placing the order . it was easy to put together ( less than 1.5hrs ) . there were some screws missing for the doors , but i called storcraft the next day , and was immediately put through with no busy signals . they sent out the screws and i had them within 10 working days ( they come from canada ) . it is beautiful with not one nick or ding in it . we 'd recommend this product to anyone as part of their childs nursery . fyi - it was not cheaper at walmart once tax and shipping were included
0	it does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water . it is worse if you use tap water . it does n't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed . when you lift the cap all the water drip . you will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use . the plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat . you wonder if it is going to melt . i am a fan of gerber products , but this one does not work
1	this is the most wonderful and handy kit i have ever had . everything about it was perfectly made from the iteams inside to the case , it is just wonderful ! ! ! !
1	the chest looks as in the picture and that is what i liked , though the instruction manual can not get any worse than this . my husband is very handy so he did not have such a hard time , although it took him 5 hours to put together , he got through it fine . instructions are not clear and they do not guide you right either but the chest looks nice in my baby room
0	i though it was just me but after reading several other reviews i see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble . the locks are impossible , the items do not quite fit right , and it would be impossible to get this thing into its `` travel bag . '' the mattress is thin and very lumpy ; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps . i bought this product thinking i could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way . i recommend you avoid this product !
1	this crib came in five days and was in perfect shape . we set it up in a reasonable amount of time . i can honestly say that it feels sturdier than any other cribs we were shopping for in the stores .
0	after reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice . i was very wrong . when i first plugged it in i could not believe how quickly the wipes heated . i thought it was great . i did think they were way too hot after they were in a while ... but a quick shake after i pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe . then a few days later i was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open ... and kept popping open with every change . then when i lifed the unit to put new wipes in ... my $ 700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped ! ( i had it replaced ! ! ) i had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table , too . same problems kept happening . so i called combi ... customer service told me the instruction manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging . she said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging . of course i could not measure the amount of fluid ... but i am not exaggerating when i say cups ! even if it did hold the cups of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes , it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it ? ? ? ? and although it is stated ... a ) there should be a warning to never use wipes not in a package and b ) why ! i bought a large `` bag '' of huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in . second ... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too , is in the manual . so i lookeed at that , too . not in the `` usage '' part.. but on the back under `` cautions '' it states this : `` unplug power cord when not in use '' . okay ... . when you have a newborn.. when are you not using your wipes.. lol ! she said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm ! ! ! i guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that ! and ... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. should n't there be a switch ? ? i would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord , of course ! crazy ! combi gave me , what i consider , ridiculous answers . they also need to get real when they write the manual . for the record.. i have written a review one other time to rave about my little bissell . this frustrated me so much i had to share the info. ! ! ! ! ! ! also.. this is baby # 4 so i am quite familiar with baby products .
0	i bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well . this thing does n't have a white noise sound but i thought maybe the womb sound might work . however the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer . it 's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds .
1	i definately recommend this product . i used it every day for my baby for the first 9 months . great both indoors and outdoors !
0	i used these through out my daughter 's infancy , largely because i bought a whole set of them , the milk storage contraptions , the breast pump , and the pacifiers . plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she would n't take any other kind . but the bottles routinely leaked , ruining several diaper bags , clothing , and nighttime feedings . apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 am ! my daughter did n't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about , but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months . all in all , i think the paci 's are great , the rest of it i could do without .
1	i did a ton of research on convertible infant-toddler car seats before my son outgrew his graco snugride at 4 months . consumer reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings ( this seat had the highest rating of all britax convertible seats ! ) i chose this seat because it has eps side-impact protection under the carseat cover . it 's worth the extra money because it 's your child 's life ! also , it 's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps , and the cover is really silky and comfortable . my son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway . my only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into the seat , but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports , not britax . also , the straps do n't have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son 's neck . i just bought some soft terrycloth ones from babies r us for $ 4.99 . it works
1	i highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born ... if you plan on breastfeeding . i was very sore in the first few weeks . the shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings . i did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks . but they got me through those weeks when i do n't know if i 'd have made it otherwise ! they were a wonderful product for me
1	i buy a lot of stuff from amazon . this bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as i bought it the price reduced on amazon . this had been a constant problem on amazon and i think somebody should do something about it . i think i should get a refund : - ) .. thanks , shobhn
1	i reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers ! i had a generic diaper throw away system it was awful ! this is so easy to use once you get the hang of it . and it really keps the smell away ! try it . you'l like it
1	i and my wife have been very pleased with the jeep wrangler all-weather umbrella stroller . unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have , this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes . plus , the handles are longer which means i ( 5'-1 '' guy ) do n't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler . the wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow . the brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller . the pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes . my only disappointment has been the sun screen . it is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son 's eyes unless i pull it directly in front of him . at that point , he ca n't see anything . that 's ok if he falls asleep , but otherwise he ( an independent todler ) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view . an added bonus would be a shoulder strap that i could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet . while it 's light and compact for a stroller , it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it . frequently my son wants to walk so i take the stroller with me because i know he 'll get tired . so again , a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier
0	i read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room . i have a great crib from usa baby and i noticed how the first review stated that she did n't buy the super expensive mattress from usa baby ( 160.00 ) which i did for my first baby and it was great . it was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit . i decided that for this baby i did n't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly . however , this mattress did n't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel . this is a medium quality mattress for a medium price . i bought it yesterday and took it back today . i am going to go with the expensive mattress that i know fits and is perfect for long term use .
0	pro : inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags . can add any odor disk in an available cup provided . con : does not mask odors . i have 8 month old triplets and it does n't help at all . even with one baby , to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day . with my triplets they still do n't fill the bin in a day , about every other day . i have the original diaper genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we 'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets . the old genie does n't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better . if i had it to do over again , i would not buy this pail , which i bought two , one for upstairs and one for down . if the smell is n't a problem for you , go for it . but if you 're picky with the smell , research something else
0	i wish i could give this stroller 0 stars because it does n't even deserve the one i gave it . it 's a light stroller..there ... the only plus . where do i start ... how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because i did n't have a reciept ( it was shower gift ) after arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as i had been using it , they shipped a new wheel free of charge ... fast forward to our vacation in hawaii . the sun shade is non existent and i had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun . the steering stinks , i have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves and does n't hold anything but a small water bottle . the basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward . my husband and i went on a hike and came to the end of the path that was n't paved . he asked me , `` are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand ? '' i replied `` please ... .i hope someone takes this piece of @ 8 ! ! 8 # ! ! ! '' end of story ... i would n't invest in the pliko p3 either . do n't get me started in the peg perego car seat either ... junk ! !
0	i got so excited when i saw this tummy-time mat . my enthusiasm was hedged when i read that the water pouch needed to be emptied daily . if had known that little detail , i would not have registered for this mat . i must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer . honestly , now i am skeptical of any `` tummy time '' mat . i think my boys prefer a brightly colored , patterned blanket , toys within reach , and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs . better off spending the money elsewhere
0	i purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son . when i put him in it , he looked so uncomfortable . i tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit , but it still covered his face . so , i decided to shell out the $ [ ... ] for the infant support pillow , expecting that to make a difference . it did n't . he still looked uncomfortable and squished , only now i wasted more money . my son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz . i ca n't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all . a big disappointment . if you 're looking for a carrier , try the bjorn . a million times better than this
1	i have used this pillow for the last 2 months , with 2 to go . i do like the shape of the pillow , i just wished it was a little longer . i had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with , but it was too big and hard to turn with . this pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over . i would just like it to be longer so i can have the little end between my legs , and the rest up higher so i can cuddle with it . when between my legs ( which helps ) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and i wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier . i would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with . beware , my husband calls this the `` sperm pillow '' , but if you can get past that , it 's a nice pillow .
1	i had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat . it was awesome . i never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough . they did tell me at the hospital , however , that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat . this goes underneath them so it probably does , but i figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway
0	i wish i would have read the reviews on this before i bought the pump . this is a bad breast pump . i could n't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples . it has very poor suction , is a pain to put together , and is uncomfortable to use . [ ... ] so do n't waste your time and money buy something different . if i could have rated this a negative i would have
1	best stroller we own . our top of the line graco and jeep strollers sit in the garage now ! it is very light weight , easy to use , and folds up very neat and tidy .
0	we have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib ... and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us . we were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us . so now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor . if you live out in the middle of no where or you do n't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you
0	does n't stay in place , too expensive ... i do better with a waterproof diaper changing pad ! i cut slits in it for the buckle and straps to go through , and it works tons better . save your money on this one
1	my son is 5 months old and loves this jumper ! ! ! he can keep himself entertained and i am able to do some things with both hands ! plus , it 's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down , laughing ! i love the tray around it . it 's big enough to set toys on but not get in the way . also , the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out . we are going on vacation in a month and this will be making the trip !
0	i tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable . you didnt even have one walker availiable , how is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker ? i was very disapionted . i guess that i would have to rate you with a zero . and i would like to know when will there be any walkers available ? i like to shop with amazon
1	my daughter received this as a gift from mommy when she was about 3 1/2 months . at first , she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face , but if you take off a ring take it higher , your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy . the only complaint i have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child . the mirror distorts your child 's vision , so i took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it ! my daughter loves it , she could be eating her breakfast , or sitting in her swing and all she 'll do is stare at her playmat ! a definite must for all parents
0	the bumper was very cute and colorful and i was excited to put it on the baby 's crib ... until i put it on ... no matter how i tried to fit it onto the crib ( it is a white spindle jenny lind crib full-size ) it fit very akwardly and never quite right . there were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib . i was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts
1	great sleepsack for our little bundle . keeps her warm toasty . i love the microfibre interior because it 's warm , but not too hot . also the exterior is wind resistant , so it 's perfect for san francisco .
0	this seemed like the original johnny jump-up i had for my first child 13 years ago . we loved that one , so i got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together , it did n't work very well . it just did n't seem as springy as it should be . i ended up returning it and getting the $ 40 version with the tray instead ( the jump go ) . people have complained about the tray pinching baby 's fingers against the doorway , but we have a wide doorway , so it works well and is a lot springier . also , our little guy likes the toy tray on the jump go version a lot
1	i love it ! ! ! , u have all that u need for helth care baby here , just in one pack ! ! ! u dont need to buy more ..
0	it lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it . now the bad ! the pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy . mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it . first he takes the tray off ( also very easy for him ) and then he pulls the back off . at that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing . do n't plan on it lasting through more than one child
0	do not buy this or any item from baby age . their customer service is horrible . amazon should remove all of their listings
0	this high chair was great to start , but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals . i thought it was me , at first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp . reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now , 3 months later , she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor . i am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground . if you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly , do n't buy this one . i am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself
0	we live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs my husband runs an isp from home - lots of computers in the house , so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics outside world , but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly . at first i was thrilled the sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved that i could set it to voice-activated only hear it when she 's reallllly awake ! but that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back to the old fp sounds lights one we had which really was n't any better ! ( and having to run up down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver transmitter of the sony was a royal pain ! ) the next day i went to target found the first years digital 2.4ghz monitor what a difference ! it was about the same price as the sony , but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does . i was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones , but after a week , no problems we have no static/interferrence ! it 's crystal clear no matter where in the house ( hubby even took it into the computer room was able to hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone 's environment is different , but the sony definately did n't work for us
1	my baby is now 5 months old , and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night . this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
1	tip ! ! ! you can push a 4 oz . baby `` juice bottle '' that juice for your baby comes in at the grocery , up into the playtex nurser bottles to extract the air from the liners . this will prevent punctures from your fingernails . be sure to remove the `` juice bottle '' before feeding baby
1	this pump works great for occasional use and after 5 months , i still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned . ( the instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss , so hopefully that problem is avoidable . ) however , beware that the motor is very loud -- i definitely would n't recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet . ( when i use it , i sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family does n't have to hear it ! ) i also recommend buying the micro-steam bags by medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them
1	i gave this stroller as a gift . so far there have been no problems .
0	i 'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo . old son weighs 28 lbs . and should be able to stay in it for alot longer ( up to 40 lbs. ) . the straps are let all the way out and it 's still too tight for him . i would n't recommend this car seat for chunky babies .
1	this jumper is worth it 's weight in gold . my son is 3 1/2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so i decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion . at first he was a little wobbly , but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around . i have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper . i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper . i am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy
0	i bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the nurser , which i already had but needed more bottles for convenience . i was very disappointed . the lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap . i used it for about a week and then got rid of it
1	i purchased this sling from ebay for $ 8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it , we did just that . it has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then surprise today i found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product , and after reading the instructions on the site and seeing photos of how to do it , i now comfortably , have my son hands free in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure . i am petite and this is one size fits all , you can pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter . if you have problems with the baby being secure , you just need to pull up the material high on the back ( theirs and yours ) and tuck it between their legs too - see the site for photos to better understand . i am now very impressed with this product , a little knowledge goes a long way ! the site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php ~ once you see how to use this product correctly , you will love it ! : o ) i do now
0	i registered for and received these medela bags . after using all 50 , i got a few free lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase . wow ! ! i will never go back to medela . the reason i registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and do n't leak . well this is the only good feature . the lansinoh bag is strong as well , easy to close ( double zip-lock vs. medela 's bothersome twisty ties ) , easy to get the air out ( unlike medela 's ) , and the lansinoh 's take-up way less room in the freezer ! stacking medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape ... and thawing will be difficult because i can see i 'll need to watch that the milk does n't spill out the top . with lansinoh i wo n't have to worry about that . my medela bags have n't split in the freezer ... i 'll give them that . but neither has my lansinoh bag .
0	we ordered one , it did n't work well . it seemed great , but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind . based on all the reviews , we thought we must have had a defective one . we ordered a replacement , but it seems to have the same issues . very disappointed .
0	this is by far the worst sling i have ever tried ! the padding is bulky and hot . it is impossible to adjust . total waste of money . i bought a pouch from www.equanimitybaby.com and it was perfect ! easy to use and very comfy . the bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk . if you ca n't use this sling , its not you , its the sling
0	we were so excited to try a jumper for our son , but were very dissapointed in this product . first of all , he tipped himself right out of it ! with the three strap design , it 's unsturdy in the back , which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor . he seemed pretty intent on jumping , so now we 've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he 's nice and snug , but it 's still unstable and wobbly . i do n't recommend this product , and in fact , we are going to try a different brand
1	my son loves this jumper . it gives him a sense of independence . he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around
1	for the price how can you go wrong , it is absolutely full featured , besides a lot of features of the stroller itself , you get a uv shade cover , a raincover , and a cover for the legs ( the boot ; useful when it is cold ) . easy to open and close , a breeze to push , i can even manage with one hand , baby is happy in it . only wish it could recline with one hand . the two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller , get a bit stuck on ours , but maybe 'cos it is new . even if i knew that would happen , i still would buy this stroller , it is something i can live with . it is almost half the price of the 2007 models , which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric . the color though is not really what i expected from a teal , it is more of a dirty blue
0	our 4 month old loved this toy , at first . but we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it did n't work more than it did . runs through batteries much too quickly . also , unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin . but now it is in the trash because i touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust . not very safe . very disappointed
1	i love this chair . we have traveled to several family members homes with the booster and it has worked so well . i have also referred people to the web site to buy one for themselves .
1	i love my new native sling ! i have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile . my baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling . he loves it too , whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy i put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in . i 've even nursed while walking around..in many places : costco , disneyland , walmart ! very discreet . i also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag , so i always have it . no bulky rings or padding . i 'm buying them for all my family with babies ! i love it , and i 've gotten lots of compliments on it . a must have item ! erica washington stat
0	i bought this because i love all the other fisher price aquarium stuff we have . but ... we have n't been thrilled with this tub . the hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i 'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth ... so she used it like 2 weeks . even so , the hammock sags onto this hard bump in the middle of the hammock so the baby 's back rests on this bump . never seemed comfortable . then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she ca n't sit up to use the other side . there are better tubs out there
1	but , there are 2 things i do n't like . one being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low . my sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old . second being that the continuous play songs , do n't actually continually play . it actually pauses for about 1-2 minutes . my son will fall asleep to the music , then it pauses and starts up again , waking him . i do love the vibration feature , which is the main reason i bought it . all in all , it is worth it
0	i just logged in to see this item 's price so that i could price ours for the consignment sale . neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time , and this did n't help that at all .
0	not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants , it is not high enough and very combersome to use . its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub . however , the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger
1	medela products are all great -- these containers came sterile and are so convenient to store pumped milk -- one can add the medela nipple and feed the baby directly from the container . very useful ! highly recommended
1	i replaced our old ocean wonders aquarium soother with this rainforest waterfall version about a month and a half ago . the aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music , but i was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time . with the aquarium , i had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep . not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all i want to do is fall back asleep . i had read that the waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes , so i thought i 'd check it out . the soother has 3 different length settings : lights , music/sounds , and movement for 6 minutes ; lights and music/sounds for 12 minutes ; music/sounds only for 18 minutes . there are 3 settings for the sounds : rainforest sounds without music ; rainforest sounds and lullabies ; rainforest sounds and classical music . there are 3 volume settings as well . i have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and i rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time . she almost instantly settles down once the music starts . if i happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she 's still awake , she 'll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own . and i 'll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as i try to fall back asleep . my only complaint is that the lights seem really bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep . i ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit . the baby ca n't see the critters , but since i do n't have them set to move , it 's not really a big deal . despite the bright lights , we 're happy with this soother
1	i bought this set for use with my second child . it helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and i needed to pump . i use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with . she did not take to the nipples that came with this set -- but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect . the bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with . overall -- -i am so happy with the medela bottles and pump ! !
1	i expected a sage or mint to come in the package when i ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking . i do n't like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right . kiwi is bette
0	this tub is a waste of money . i bought it this evening and i 'm returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning . water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery , unsafe floor . very unsatisfied with this product
1	i just got this item for my two story house . i was able to see the crib from the upstairs nursery throughout my house and even outside . the monitor is not in color so that is misleading but the picture looks grea
1	it works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it ! ! sometimes there is a little interference , but if you just move the monitor ( sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference ) it will work great ! we have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again ! ! the night vision works great , even in our son 's dark room . the color is great as long as there is sufficient light .
0	i did n't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out , and it does take standard garbage bags . after a few months of use , the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off . i assembled it back together , and within a few days , the spring broke in half . i tried to get another spring by calling safety first . they only had the blue top without the spring . the guy said i 'd just have to buy another pail if i wanted a working pop top
0	we purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units . do n't bother . whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor 's baby ! what 's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you ca n't then walk into the baby 's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren ? ? ? ? they are getting returned right away .
0	when we first bought our baby 's mattress , it did not have any unusual odors at all . we washed the ultimate mattress pad before using it , but after a short time , we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time . we finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free . by this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well . use of the organic did not cause any problem , but since we had not yet put two and two together ( not smart ) , we put the ultimate mattress pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell . we now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress . the side that never came in contact with the ultimate mattress pad smells just fine , but the side that we did use it on has a stench you do n't want your baby sleeping on . i guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib . we actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we did n't want our little boy sleeping directly on it . when we did try that , he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face
1	the car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months i have owned them . they are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt . i own a minivan , so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan , i would consider a different brand . good luck . ke
1	this is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he 's waiting for breakfast . there are lots of things to shake , spin and rattle . the suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard . also , it 's very durable because he 's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it has n't broken yet ! at first i was n't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon ' toy does n't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button . now he does it on his own and hears the whole song . i think that 's great . i would recommend this set to anyone .
1	our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and i felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product . from the very beginning , she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby . she was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open . once they were finished cleaning her up , my husband and i were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds . right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch . she rarely ever cried , and when she did , it was a quiet little `` lay lay lay '' sound , not the wild waa-waa 's . throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst . where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment , she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation ! at only three months of age , people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals . she hit every developmental milestone months early , especially in language ( sign and speech ) , music appreciation , and colors/shape/letter/number recognition . her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that i should have five more just like her ! when we bought the babyplus , we thought , `` if it helps only 10 % as well as the testimonials say it does , it will be worth it '' . we 're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours . we 're now expecting child # 2 ( 25 weeks along ) and although not using the baby plus could be an interesting experiment ( same gene pool , same parenting , etc . ) , we 're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it .
0	i do n't have an abundance of money , but i would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better . i do n't even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets ... from what i understand , these are the only sheets that fit the thing , so i guess i 'm just out of luck . hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon .
1	my daughter is breastfed , but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one ( with pumped milk and/or formula ) . we originally bought avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2-1/2 months she went bonkers ! refused to drink from the bottle . granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles ( not every day , but at least once per week ) . i tried a dr. browns and it was the same problem . and it did n't matter if it was breastmilk , forumula , warm , cold , room-temp , etc . she just screamed ! during this time , she had been using a platex ortho pacifier , but had begun using the soothie pacifer i got from the hospital . she did n't like the soothie pacifier at all to begin with ... took several months for her to like it . anyway , i randomly had a freebie soothie bottle from motherhood maternity in the drawer that i thought i might as well try . she took it immediately ! ! i have since bought several more in preparation for daycare , and she still takes them with no problems ( she 's 4 months now ) . i have not had any problem with leaks , and in fact she stays much much cleaner with this bottle than she did with avent . my only problem , is there is no disc to put underneath the nipple when transporting or mixing in the bottle . however , the stage 1 nipples are pretty slow , so as long as its kept upright it does okay . i have been using my old avent bottle with sealing discs as milk transport and pouring into the soothie to feed .
0	we have had nothing but problems with the receiver . we have it in our kitchen and it 's no more than 30 feet from our son 's bedroom . any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal . the beep is very annoying because it wo n't stop until you move out of the way . if we open the fridge door it beeps also . we 've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck . it is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds , even at low volume , until you change the frequency . when it works the sound quality is very good , although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep . we recommend the angelcare movement sensor and monitor by bebe sounds . the sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby 's mattress . it senses each time your baby takes a breath . if there is no movement it sounds an alarm . great insurance against sids !
1	i purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only , but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well . it is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded . my son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds ; both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way . we 've only used it a handful of times so far , but i ca n't think of one bad thing to say about it . we 're very pleased with our purchase
0	i like the idea of all this in one case ( and it 's hard to complain at this price ) , but some of these things would be better bought separately . we 've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here . here 's what i found : item # 1 ) the case is fine , but things do fall out all the time . # 2 ) i have n't used the tweezers yet , but the magnifying part sounds nice . # 3 ) the nail clippers were way too sharp . we cut my daughter 's skin more than once ( but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip ! ) now we use my regular clippers , and i have n't gotten her skin since . the soft grip thing actually make them slide around more , so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to . trust me , it 's easy to clip skin on fingers that little ! # 4-7 ) the emery boards are very handy , but any emery boards would work . # 8 ) we got a different thermometer ; this one was too slow . faster ones are more expensive , but they 're worth it for a sick squirmy baby . # 9 ) i have n't used the medicine dropper , but the one time she did need one , i actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store , and they gave me one for free ( then later i found out we had this one . ) # 10-11 ) the brush and comb are nice . i 'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less . # 12 ) my daughter 's only 7 months old , and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile , since there are no teeth ( and even when there are , i believe you wipe them with gauze , not a toothbrush for awhile . ) basically , although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it was n't very expensive , we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use ( thermometer ) , or have found other things that would work just as well ( regular nail clippers , free medicine dropper . ) i 'm certainly not saying that you should n't get one , because i 'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it . if you get it for a shower gift , great ; if not , you can find substitute items just as easily
1	i bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers . with the touch of one button , i can keep track of how long it has been since i fed my baby . i do n't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone . the first unit i was sent was defective and i received terrific customer service when i contacted the company . i am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because i 'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well . maybe a future model
0	the walker has a few flaws . first of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal . it is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child 's head . my son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker ... ..constantly . the seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high , it should be roomier and drop lower .
1	this doll is attractive , does everything it is supposed to do , comes with appropriate accessories , and above all , children love it . appears to be well made , with a soft , cuddly body , and our 6 year old granddaughter loves it .
0	i have had this swing a little less than 2 months . i bought it for my 5 month old because she would n't sit in a traditional swing and i thought this looked like a comfy place to nap . it was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up . i called fisher price and the part is on backorder til mid- may . i guess i just got a lemon because everyone else 's seem to be fine . i am truly disappointed in fisher price . they usually exceed my expectaions . i paid $ 150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it
1	i ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we 're out strolling in the sun . it does a pretty good job ; only my son 's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined ( my only beef about the product ) , but i can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem . i like the fact that the shade protects from uv rays and is easily adjustable . i leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached . i think the side pouches are an excellent plus . i am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family
1	my 14-month old daughter loves these snack cups . she can monitor her snack time , eating as much or as little as she needs . she loves carrying around a snack cup in one hand and a sippy cup in the other . the only reason i give it 4 stars , is because she has a tendency of keeping her hand in the flaps while walking around . this makes single cheerios fall out here and there . but , nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl . i 've only used them on cheerios so i ca n't comment on other snacks ( she tends to choke on goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair ) . she has n't tried taking off the lid like other reviewers , so that 's not a problem for us ( at least not yet ) . we use them all the time and i definitely recommend them
1	we bought this for our son ( now two ) , and he grabs his keys and phone whenever we are going in the car . it gives him something to play with , and they are n't too noisy for long trips
1	i am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes . then i became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months . i bought the harness buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months . i could n't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time . the first time we used it i started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash , but she loved it . she enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash . i can not tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is ! it is so soft and cuddly . we now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same harness buddy . oh , and i think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic . we love it !
0	i need something that i can use on top of a regular dresser , but this one i do n't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides , 6 pieces that would n't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side . also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back , cushion kinda sinks in that area . the diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric . it looks used even when its not . which also does not fit snugly in the pad . the belt looks flimsy and generally useless , especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable . i purchased another changing pad by childkraft . it is way better than this one , just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose
1	i am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well . as i am large and this pack fits me , i would think this would ajust to a small person well . i especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back . i hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old ( 19 lbs ) in the pack without problems . the built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed . the pack is very comfortable for both of us . the interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller , i can drop him lower in the pack . i looked at many other more expensive packs as i thought they would be better fitted out , but this pack has all the features i wanted for a lower price . i highly recommend this pack .
1	my husband and i ordered these pictures for our sons nursery . our theme is barn yard , we also got the coordinating lamp , light-plate switch and night light . these pictures really help to complete the room . the delivery time was slow ( pictures arrived two days after set date ) but they were definately worth waiting for ! they appear to be actual canvas and acrylic art-work . i would recommend these to anyone who is looking for the perfect picture to complete their nursery !
1	i think that this is a great stroller for traveling . i have a 4 year old and she loved riding in it . we used it on our vacation to disney world and it was wonderful for all of the walking we had to do . it fit in tight spaces and was very easy to manuever . it was light weight and easy to use . overall i am glad that i had this great strolle
0	i purchased this potty for my son . i thought that the `` royal '' turns would give him an interest in using it , it did n't . he used it once and cried ! he would not sit on it again . i was very disappointed . the potty would sing for now reason sometimes and every time you would touch it . i do not recommend
1	when i saw the pictures , i thought i could fit both kids . they fit , but with little room for two . no room for play . i will purchase another one . still a good product , safe and sturdy and easy to clean .
1	this lock gives piece of mind . it 's easy for adults to use and almost impossible for kids to open . it 's sturdy and does n't require drilling into any cabinetry . i started out with four and ordered more to have all over the house
1	i own this blanket and just bought another ! i brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park . it was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me , my daughter , and all of our stuff . a few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too . my baby spits up quite a bit , especially during tummy time , so i decided to buy another one to use in the house . it cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth . great investment
0	i was given this as a gift and i was very excited to use it out and about . but when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off . plus when we were all done , i had to try to clean it off as best i could , then put it in my diaper bag-yuck ! i much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table
1	we have twins and these mattress pads are much more convenient than trying to wrestle with getting new sheets on the cribs in the middle of the night . they are holding up well through frequent washings and are easy to attach . i gave it 4 stars because it 's not extremely soft , though it is n't bad . i also like that the top layer is breathable - gives me peace of mind
1	have used these bibs for two kids now , wow do they last , and unlike some bibs , these can go right in the washer and dryer - well worth the money ! still using them for my messy 3 year old
1	i bought this beacause i needed my gate to be just a little bit wider . it attached very easily and was easy to install . also , it is very hard to find in stores
0	serious warning : consumer reports , the independent consumer magazine , called a specific model of this walker , model 14565 , `` unacceptable '' because it 's unsafe . ( see their dec. 8 , 2006 blog on their website . ) anohter similar model , 14570 , is okay . model 14565 is deemed unsafe by cr because it does not prevent the walker , and the baby , from falling downstairs as it should . cr points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel . unfortunately , it 's impossible to tell which model amazon is selling . your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store . be sure to avoid model 14565
0	we too had problems with turning the sterilizer on . the unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed , but several presses got it to work a couple of times . after about 6 uses it died completely . not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever ( like an electric kettle ) is exactly , but these guys found it . this unit also left a lot of condensation in the stuff we sterilized
0	this product is a mess . i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50 $ down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun
1	i spent quite some time online researching on a good , reasonable potty and found this product . it 's a bestseller and even better - most of the buyers are very satisfied with it . it 's functional , sturdy , easy to clean and seems comfy . my son had some success with that one . : - )
0	this step stool is a safety hazard . the sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over . in fact the stepping surface is so small that it 's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it . and when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs
1	even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning , it fits perfecly . evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it . we needed this piece for our size opening , we really had to squeeze it in , but it is a great fit . the gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye . it took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism , using 2 hands at first . after some practice it was easy to use . we liked it so much that we bought another .
1	this monitor is by far the best baby item we have . i love that i can sleep at night , and the monitor will alert me if my son stops breathing . we have been using it for 4 months , and have had no false alarms . you just have to remember to turn it off when you pick up the baby ! i did not have this monitor with my first child , and i sure wish that i had . it is a must have for any new mom who worries about sids , whether this is your first or your fifth baby . well worth the added expense . do n't even mess around with other monitors , just get this one and get some sleep ! by far the best item i own for my baby .
1	a recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book . i had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412 , which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema . the information on teething is a bit more meager . i agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book . but i still think this is an outstanding baby book . it provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it 's hard to find the time or energy to read .
1	this play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers , espicially ones that garden , since the invention of disposable diapers ! i bought two and an extension panel , which make for an ample size playpen . inside , i put a little tikes climber , a step one ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel , and a playskool grow-with-me picnic table , and he still has plenty of room to romp . i can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips .
1	we bought our floppy seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old . even though he was still a little `` floppy '' himself when it came to sitting up , the floppy seat supported him . he 's now 18 months old , and it 's still going strong ! although , now he wears `` real '' shoes , and the leg openings tend to get caught on then . it took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart , but now it 's so fast ! we also use it every time we go out to eat . as a matter of fact , the one ( and only ) time we forgot to bring it along , our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair . the belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck , and would not open , after multiple attempts ! we were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway . he was fine , but we were all shaken up ! if we 'd had our ( familiar ) floppy seat cover , we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster . every second counts !
0	bought this mirror at target , along with many other eddie bauer baby products available there . this mirror is hard to install , and everytime you hit a bump it falls down , rendering it useless . it is just very poorly made from cheap materials . i am very disappointed with the eddie bauer line at target . almost every eddie bauer product i bought ended up breaking in a week or i just returned due to such poor design . target needs to stop selling these items , they are a waste of money
0	tired of hearing your baby cry ? this is the monitor for you . you 'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing . looks like evenflo was being literal when they named the product whisper connect . you can barely hear anything at full volume . i 'm going to return it tomorrow if i can resist backing over it with our car .
1	i bought this yesterday when i knew i was going to a `` tailgate '' party where i would be away from the baby and having a few drinks , and i may have to `` pump and dump '' . i was nervous at first , but this thing worked perfectly ! it worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet . it successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug . i also bought the medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by . this outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet , clean and safe place to pump your milk . the cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car . i love this thing and wish i bought it sooner ! ! it will also be great on long trips , too , so you do n't get any clogged milk ducts . highly reccommended ! !
1	we had the britax roundabout for our daughters and were so very pleased with them , especially with the safety ratings . when my older daughter was ready for a booster , the choice was easy -- britax ! my daughter loves her booster . when i first got it in the mail ( we live overseas ) i was initially disappointed because i thought she would n't like the side supports , but she loves them ! i would like to comment on two previous comments ... .boosters are not faa approved and should n't be used on an airplane . boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts . second , you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat . it is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt . i simply want to comment on those because britax makes a great ... .and safe product
0	i ordered a kidco elongated child gate . a recommended extension needed to be purchased . the wrong extension was sent . i needed g24 model and received 24 '' extension for a different model
1	we bought this when my daughter was newborn , and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well , now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel . she has always loved it , in the snow and on the ground and on picnics , its great , a lot better than plastic wheels , the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move . weve really liked it so far , except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby , its great . the only thing is now i have 2 kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on
1	we have n't had any problems cleaning this chair -- occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum , but that is simple enough . most of the time , we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides . ( we 'd do that with any high chair . ) the tray does n't fit in our dishwasher , but that too has been easy to clean in the sink . we love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl . our daughter is very happy in her chair . she is only 16 months , but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all . our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out . that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw -- we just live with it since it is n't that big a deal .
1	i only occasionally feed my baby , and my apartment does n't have a dishwasher . i usually decide right before going out that i want to take a bottle , so this disinfects everything really quick - in 3 minutes . as opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes . and i do n't use it every days , so i do n't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz i would have to sterilize it again right before using .
0	decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath , but one side does n't seem to want to stick to the walls
0	the suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter . my 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals - they crinkle and delight her .
1	it 's very safe because of the non-slip rubber . our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes to the potty . nice color too . highly recommended ! !
1	my husband and i bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son . he liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old . the seat is incredibly easy to clean ( which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot ) and it 's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we are n't using it . both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time .
0	this is the most stupid product you can buy . it makes opening doors even easier . maybe instead of selling this as a `` door knob lock '' , it may be sold to be useful with people with arthritis . this does n't even deserve one star
1	this is a durable and quality product . my son uses it for everything , from turning the lights on to getting on the potty . i use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that i must hide from my 2 and a half year old . i must say that i am a hard core fan on baby bjorn items as they are durable , classic in design and color . this is a sturdy non-slip item it has supported me for months 120lbs ( give or take 10 lbs ! ) we used it so much that i bought another step stool , made by playskool and i wished i had bought another babybjorn
1	my 6 month old daughter just transitioned from her infant seat carrier to the britax boulevard and is loving it . she looks comfortable in it , and i really appreciate the side impact support in case of an accident . i can really see her growing into it as well . it is a little large for our camry but there is still enough room for one other person ( instead of 2 ) in the backseat
0	i was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first . i went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out . the sternum strap would not even snap over my chest ... i have an average build but have a chest ... .and it would'nt reach . my friend tried it also and had the same problem . i would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake
1	we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews . i would have to say that it does work well . the only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom . also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor . it has given me peace of mind that i do n't have to run in every sound she makes . i can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me . i would recommend this product
1	i just purchased this crib bedding . the quality is great . i love the thickness and the velour . worth the money
0	i had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore , they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad . i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great , unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily . and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white
1	i bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding . this is my 2nd child i have never been told of this danger . i highly recommend this bumper . it comes in 2 pieces , the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up down , the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard . there are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are . i was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath . i love that it 's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress , it velcros at each end across both the top bottom for a tight fit , it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight that it 's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it . i just wish that i had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers . thankfully i heard my son screaming when i did . highly recomend this product , or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers
1	this gate has some good points and just one negative . pros - good price , easy to operate . mine are very easy on the batteries , i replace them about every 2 months . they are located on the kid 's bedroom doorways , about 8 ' apart from each other . we use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs , and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister 's room when she wants some quiet time . for those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both . so simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other , then set up the second gate seperately . i have never had them malfunction following these steps . cons : i also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door . i found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough . it was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back . we nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this . but since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems . it has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are..right down to bare wood . i will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down . the also should be a little taller imo , and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open . always check the gate when you close it to make sure it is closed..a few rare occasions i have found it not completely closed . this usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it . overall , 4 stars . would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching . good price though and it is put together well
0	the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over , and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested , defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place . i would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected .
0	the product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs . my daughter is only 27lbs . and it could not hold her . while it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not . after one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier . i returned this item and got the sherpani rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs . i love it . also , the cross terrain claim to `` load balancing straps distributes weight off parent 's shoulder and onto hips '' it does not . i was in horrible pain after about an hour . in both my upper and lower back . i suggest you do n't waste your money and go with the higher end products like sherpani and kelty . this will work for a smaller child , but only if you can compfortably carry the weight . i did like the easily adjustable seat and back . i was able to adjust from my height to my husbands .
0	i tried putting this on a shopping cart from target . this does not cover area at all ! ! i caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped ! not good ... plus its annoying to put on
0	i got this as a gift and registered for it for i was pregnant with my daughter . this was the biggest mistake . the canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it . to make it recline , is a chore . my husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up , not to make fun of him . he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out . but even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy . we did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money . well , worth it . i would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good .
1	my boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it . it 's fun and it 's a miniature size adult potty . they love it . the seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already , but we are making it work . we have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer ... for an alternative way to hook to crib . they were less than helpful . i am thinking about returning the entire set i 'm so disappointed
0	i tried this swing then this fisher-price 's open travel swing . in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat . the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it did n't stay closed well and the `` palm tree '' was always in the way . finally i bought the fisher-price aquarium swing . i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place ( so it wo n't fold over on baby ) and it is easier to assemble and haul around
0	i brought this gift for my son and his wife ; their daughter was born on 2/21/07 . when i questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer , they just did n't get around to using it . i insisted they read the directions and start using it . the next day , my son stated . wow mom this is the best baby shower gift . they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked . how much timed it saved them as new parents , and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time . my son was so thankful , that i insisted he use the product
0	i recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide . within one week of use , the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable . i am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type . this gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for
0	we could n't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker . unfortunately , after countless times of putting in new batteries , we realized that the toy did n't work . i immediately contacted kolcraft and they are sending me another toy . i also wished i had gotten the one with the mirror , instead i have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it . and to add to that , she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes . other than that , i really like the walker ! lol : } i think it will be better once we get a new toy
1	we purchased this gate for an odd sized opening , because it is expandable . it attaches to both sides of the opening so you open it on either side . we have the gate in a very high traffic opening , and it is not only easy to open and close , but has stood up to the bigger kids going in out . in the evening when the kids go to sleep , we simply unlatch both sides and set it off to the side . i love it so much , i 'm buying 2 more to replace those pitiful pressure mounted gates we have . works well to keep the dog contained from the baby area also . quality , durable product . i definitely recommend it . target is the only place i have found this gate
0	this sling was very difficult to use i could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious . i used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back . it was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders . plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and/or purse so that just added extra weight . do n't waste the money i would much rather have another front/back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a lot safer . the only things i did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci 's , keys , money and cell .
0	my husband and i bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills . well , it did not control odor . the plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week . the odor escaped even when the pail was closed . you do save money on refills at first . but when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows , you have to change the bag more often . i used a lot of baking soda and lysol spray to help control the stink . also , the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily , and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things . i would not recommend this product
0	i used one of these with my son ( he 's 3 , so it was n't that long ago ) but as i was getting ready to use it again with my daughter , i started thinking about what a pain the floppy seat was to use . getting it back into it 's `` bag '' was such a hassle i used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping ... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money . this thing is named well , as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again . i started reading reviews of other seat covers , trying to find a better option and i sure found it ! i was really hesitant at the price of the buggy bagg , but i could tell when i took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money ! i 've only had the buggy bagg for 3 days and i am already thrilled that i spent the money on it ... definitely worth the extra $ 20 ! it is super-well padded and can really , truly be put into the cart with one hand ! ( the floppy seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart ! ) do n't waste your money on the floppy seat- it 's a flop of a product !
1	i ( and more importantly , my twin boys ) really like this jumper . it seems safer than the doorway jumper , mainly because their fingers wo n't get mushed . i like that it has multiple height settings and that it 's on a sturdy frame . they love to jump in it , and before they were able to crawl , it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise . plus , it 's a nice safe place for times when i 'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies . the cons ( that would n't keep me from buying it again ) are : it takes up more room than a doorway jumper , the rattly bear is pretty loud , and the music is obnoxious . there is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music , though
0	i have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and i am not impressed . my daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas . i experimented with the dr. brown bottle and the playtex vent-air . both seemed to help but the playtex is by far the best . people complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable
1	we started with dr. brown 's when my daughter was just three weeks old - she 's now 10 months - and have loved them from the very beginning . we 've used them both for breastmilk and for formula , and they 've been great for both . we 've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting-up episodes , and i give all the credit to the bottles . they 're comfortable for me to hold , light enough that even a young-ish baby can hold them on their own , and easy to fill . the cleaning is a bit of a pain - more parts than in other brands of bottles - but it 's worth it . and we have n't found that dr. brown 's leaks any more than any other brand . definitely give these a try - they 're great
1	i love this product . all new mothers should include this on their registry , how we 've lived without it for this long , i 'll never know ! it is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now
0	this carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached . the fabric is very cheap , and it melted in the dryer . i wash my carseats after every roadtrip , and it did n't even last one roadtrip before melting . it ripped the day that i got it trying to adjust the straps . i was very disappointed in this carseat . i would not purchase it again . i loved my previous carseats being the alpha omega , and a graco . if you are looking for something cheap this is the product . there are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured . try those ones first . this is an awful carseat .
0	my baby absolutely loves her regular swing so we thought this would be a great travel swing . she cried everytime we put her in it . it really does not provide a full swing motion . she tends to like her swing on the highest setting and this swing barely moved in either direction
1	i would like to state that i take issue with the previous reviews , in that they claim this piece is flimsy . it is not at all flimsy , nor does it look cheap . in fact , my husband and i have the entire set ( changing table and dresser ) , along with the montery crib . when you receive the boxes , there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer , not the store , will handle all returns , exchanges , or shipping of missing parts . well , we had a question regarging set-up of this product and thought there was a defect . we spoke with storkcraft directly , and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly . storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant , and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them directly , and they would arrange for a prompt exchange . this piece looks beautiful , and serves its purpose as a infant/child dresser . i am sure that you could spend $ 1,000 on a high-end piece , but if you are looking for something that is 1 ) affordable , and 2 ) well-made , and 3 ) beautiful , then storkcraft is a good choice
1	such a great product for my baby . she loves it as she can hear the music with me singing at the same time . it builds confidence for me singing so my baby loves that we sort of sing together . the plastic book is so gentle to be held by those tiny hands . such a winne
1	our $ 10 piece of junk umbrella stroller ( you know the one ) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at harrod 's in london , and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller . turns out it 's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right . you ca n't go wrong . it 's sturdy , well-balanced , super easy to fold up and carry around ( sling it over your shoulder -- it 's that light ) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield ( ours happened to come with a rain cover as well , but this was in london and i do n't know if this us version comes with it automatically ) . the color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness . love it . like many people , with two kids we calculated that we 've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years ( how does that happen ? ! car seats , too ) and this is the best so far . go for it
0	these come in both boy and girl colors . the picture shows pink , purple , and yellow bottles . i received blue and green bottles . i contacted amazon who promptly sent me another three sets ( all of the first three sets were wrong ) . in the second shipment they only got one set right . i e-mailed to return these as well . when i sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because `` they had already replaced the items '' . be careful when ordering from this site
0	too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly . i feel like i 'm constantly filling the container w/ water . though my son is a sound sleeper , it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b/c of the loudness of the humidificr . i would not buy this item
0	i would n't let my dog sleep on these sheets . they are of the worst quality imaginable . we took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit perfectly . i recommend the koala baby name brand porta rib sheet . they are available at bru and have elastic all the way around , making for a snug fit . and the quality is 1000 times improved over the pnp sheets
0	my son is ten days old . i tried these bottles and was highly disappointed . the liners are a pain in the butt . once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it , if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again . i changed to dr. brown 's bottles and my son is having less gas and is n't wearing his food .
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months , and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere . also , the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out ... wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up , but i 'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !
1	as we all know , you 're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent sids . the sleepsack is a great product ! it keeps baby nice and warm , yet you do n't have to worry about a blanket . and there 's space down in the bottom for his feet so he 's not too restricted . also , the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom , so you do n't have a big zipper poking baby in the face
1	this is a great wipes warmer for use with cloth wipes if you are cloth diapering . the wipes are nice and warm and do n't dry out . i have seen no rust like one of the other reviews said . nightlight is also very nice and gives just enough light to see in the middle of the night . i change out the wipes every 3-4 days and have had no problems with mildew .
0	this thermometer is totally worthless . it does n't read the correct temp . on myself , husband or baby . when my little one was sick at 3 months old , this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us . i picked up a digital 'under the tongue ' type and simply used it under his arm . works great -- cost me $ 3 . i ca n't give this one away
0	the volume control on this is totally lame . i ca n't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime . also , the sound quality is poor in general . i suppose it 's ok for just playing in the room , but definitely not for bed . you can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price
1	my 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so i stopped putting her in the crib because i was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much i was afraid of her hurting herself . so now i love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and i do n't have to worry . they were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat . great product ! i highly recommend it ! ! ! !
1	i love this cover because it is so comfy for the baby ! i have had my boppy for almost a year now and i used it the whole time i nursed my baby . love it
0	i used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old . he woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated . the thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin . i wo n't ever use it again
0	we got this for my son . we had it for 2 months . when he would get excited and try to bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard toys . last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth . it was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me . nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth . over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much . he lost the tooth on the 8th days . when he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root . now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years . please choose another product for your child . it 's not worth the risk
0	its a great price but its very small . its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small . there 's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it .
1	we just bought this for our 3 yr. old , and he does everything on it ! it is very durable , and also light weight so we can move it around easily . this table will last well through our second son as well .
1	this is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump . the long cord was helpful too , so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete . it was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car , but i 'm hoping that it gets easier the more i use it .
0	i have owned my diaper dekor plus for 25 months . in 2005 , i found glowing reports in the wall street journal and most other places . it definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile , but ... the trapdoors have broken twice . i contacted regal lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement . that free replacement broke less than 6 months later . you ca n't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken ! this week , i contacted regal lager again and they said a replacement is $ 10 . i loved this pail until the trapdoors broke . unfortunately , it looks like it is a common design flaw as i browse the reviews from the last year or so . i am an engineer and i do n't know what to say , except i am really annoyed that the product is not more durable . regal lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system , instead of relying on $ 10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle ! now i have to decide whether to spend $ 10 on another replacement , try to fix it myself , get a different pail or maybe none of the above . at what point is enough , enough ?
1	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did . we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day . the jumperoo has sturdy construction , and the 4 settings are useful . i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it , but he 's been fine . he does n't play with the toy attachment . i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame
1	i love the 5 point harness . my daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt . this seat was easy to install and we love it
1	true -- as other reviewers have stated , this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware , which i have not , so i can not comment on how well that works . as a tension or pressure-mounted gate , i love this item . i have no problems stepping over it -- and i 'm only 5 ' 5 '' -- so i never found it to be a nuisance . it 's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily . it 's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings , although that takes two hands . it 's light enough that i can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as i travel from floor to floor . my 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs . again , we love the fact that we do n't have to damage the molding on the doorframes . my husband and i are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one
0	well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it , so she decided not to sell it to me . so i never got this car seat . i really do n't understand why i need to write a review on it
1	we bought two of these to take on a family trip . we chose these both for the price , and for the higher weight tolerance ( 45 lb ) . our 40 pound six-year old can swap places with a sibling when he gets tired during a long day at the zoo . they recline far enough for an infant , also . but , our 10 month old preferred to sit forward and hold onto the front bar to take in the sights . the strollers are compact and light . the underneath storage mesh can hold a purse and small diaper bag . there is another pocket on the back that can hold a water bottle , as well as a latch that can hold small items that have handles . the stroller was also easy to maneuver . we are very pleased with our purchase ! the stoller can even hold a combi carseat , but it did n't work with our graco
1	i think that this crib toy is awesome ! since my son was 3 months old we 've turned it on every night at bedtime for him . he just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays . my son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it . and the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it . if i switch it to manual mode , he can turn on the music himself ! he can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material . plus , he has another friend to keep him company in his crib ( a big happy turtle with fish in his belly : - ) . thus far , the straps have n't broken or cracked and i have removed it from the crib a couple of times . also , the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes . its just a matter of which mode you switch it to . ( reading the instructions really helps . ) i strongly recommend this
0	this product serves its purpose , but does not need to cost almost $ 30 ! basically , it 's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it . i 'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well , if not better , if you take the time to look
1	since i also have a two year old , it has been so great to have this wrap . i can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and i can keep my hands free . the best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes . if he is fussy and i do n't really know why , it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk . the only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome , so i would n't use it if i was only going to have it on for a few minutes . this is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby . and the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all
1	i received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver . how nice that i can monitor my baby 's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute ! the are two different channels , so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off . sometiems it 's also just a matter or re-positioning the monitor to resolve the noise . we were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls , but switching to channel b solved that . i 've used the evenflo whisper connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied
0	i got this to make sterilizing easier . i 'm not sure it does . it is kind of a pain . cartoonish in appearance , cheap looking , cheap feeling , not nearly enough room for what you have to put in , you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things . water does spill like crazy from the lid . does it really sterilize ? i hope so ! i ca n't tell . air vent bottles air dry , but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer i have . why ? i do n't know , the steam ? metal of heating unit is n't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you do n't get cut ! i was very disappointed ! for that amount of money i should have gotten something of better quality ! you pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure !
0	for the first couple of weeks the snack trap worked perfectly . after that , my daughter ( 7 months old ) figured out how to remove the top ( it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware , but easily removed ) , and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping , throwing , or shaking the snacks all around the house . on the positive side , the flaps for the top are very soft , and when she does reach in , there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers . if only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on , then this would work perfectly . as it is , my daughter loves it , but we hate cleaning up the mess
1	this is such a versatile chair - love the way you can fold it down compactly , yet it 's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used . the tray stores on the back legs when not in use - nice touch . for the reviewer who complained that the `` thing that separates the legs '' is attached to the tray - you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray ... plus it 's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up . my 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray - terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime
0	i bought this for my grand-daughter , and here is my daughter 's reviews of how this product is working ( or not ) `` hmmmmm ... . she loves the music more than the potty itself . we listen and dance to the `` potty '' song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty . i think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet . otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat . i think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better . or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet , so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks . thanks , anyway . '' i do n't find this very encouraging , so i wish i had purchased something else .
1	i tried several different bottles , including avent and second nature , and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and did n't flow too fast or make her gag . the nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital ( which is the only pacifier she will take as well ) . i am breastfeeding , and with all of the trouble i was having findnig a bottle , i was worried about what would happen when i went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle . this bottle has eased my mind . also , the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles . the reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight , but as long as i make sure it is tight i have no problems
0	i bought the avent bottles when i was pregnant because they were babiesrus 's `` best pick '' yeah right ! i wonder how many are returned on a daily basis . aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking ! i would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money
0	i 'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product . my wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory . unfortunately , because of the collapsible design this `` bath '' tub does not hold water , it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together . there is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in , but it is useless . the sling is useful for bathing an infant , and the removable ring does it 's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit . unfortunately , by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk . i guess they call it safety 1st as your kid ca n't drown in a dry bath tub
1	these bags work fine in the dekor diaper pail . it would probably be easier if you could just buy trash bags from the store instead of special ordering them . but i am borrowing this diaper pail , so these are the bags that it uses . they do work great ; keep the smell inside , etc . if you order be sure if you need regular or dekor plus diaper bags . there is a difference in the size of the bags
0	i ordered this crib almost a month ago and i could n't be more disappointed . every single piece was damaged somehow -- either chipped , cracked , discolored or stained ... i will never buy a storkcraft piece ever again . do n't waste your time and money on this crib ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i bought this so i could check to make sure my baby was ok since he ca n't hold his head up quite yet and so i could see my cute baby 's face in the mirror while driving in our honda odyssey minivan . he 's in an infant car seat though and i could n't see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror . i finally figured out i had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest . i 'm still worried about it flying off but it does work now . perhaps it would work on the window but i did n't bother . on the window , it would be held by suction and i really do n't want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby
1	these slings have been an essential part of being parents . both my husband and i use new native slings on a daily basis . we 've been 'wearing ' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months . this helped me tremendously in getting to 'know ' my baby . it allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because i can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry . it helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy . we do not even own the detachable infant carseats . i can not imagine having to lug one of those things around ! i feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world . it gives her a sense of security even in new situations . unlike front facing carriers , she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated . there are endless benefits to 'wearing ' your baby and i feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so . there are no buckles or rings or fasteners , just slide it on . if at first you do n't succeed , try again later . it may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage . another tip , get moving ! the motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort . again , baby wearing is such a wonderful thing . i suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling/carrier that works well for you . we recommend this one to all new parents and have never had anyone complain
0	i bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received . however , it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old . my son was born 5 lb . 11 oz . he did not fit snugly into this seat , even with the head cushion . his head rolled around or rolled forward . i tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work . also , if i adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter , it would roll around a lot more ( i have leather seats ) . additionally , the material on the seat is not breathable -- it is velvety -- so my son 's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips , even in the winter . i would say that once my son was bigger ( about 14 pounds and 26 inches ) , i removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position -- this is when he actually `` fit '' into the seat , however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty , making him very uncomfortable for longer trips .
1	i had to return to work after my second daughter was born and had no place to pump . i bought this and pumped in my car for several months . great
0	i ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home . i expected the cots to be fairly sturdy , perhaps along the line of a porta-crib . instead , the frame does n't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily . the twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them ; the cots did n't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them . i returned the cots to target
0	the leak-o-matic fully lived up to its name . as a new parent , i do n't have time to do things once , forget about doing things twice . i need simple and reliable- the leak-o-matic is neither . it worked ok for the first few times , then i partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime . by the time i returned with baby in hand , the leak-o-matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter , soaked all my other items on the counter , water ran down onto the floor , under the baseboard , and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor . the leak-o-matic is the hindenburg of all baby bathtubs . it is too bad that i can not give it zero stars . there are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly , but judging from the number of irate mommies here , i conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering . think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese ! the cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached . the fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water , so you 're always repositioning the baby . i 'm surprised that this thing did n't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety ' . i did not research every single item on the registry- i figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least `` ok '' . back it goes . if you buy this thing , then good luck to you , and do n't burn the toast !
0	i bought the volo after reading many reviews . however , it was utter disappointment . as soon as i took out the stroller from a box , and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece . yes , the stroller is light , and very very flimsy . i returned it right away
1	we used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month-old son to mexico . we always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage . he was attached to our rolling carry-on curbside and off we went . we were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry . at $ 20 , you ca n't beat the price . our friends had to carry their car seat , stroller , luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap
0	i inherited this product from my neightbor last week . i have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it . i can not get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part . other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart . i would love to try this product , but as long as it is dirty and can not be cleaned properly , it will not be used . what a shame ... baby products should be made so that they clean up easily
1	this chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son 's only high chair . i love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair . however , i bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything . i thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage . even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go , he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair . if you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you do n't have a climber - this is the chair for you , but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs
0	as the other reviewer stated , the seal appears to be faulty on this , and it stopped working almost straight away . i have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well
1	i got this car seat for my 10 month old daughter . i was concerned that it would be too large for my car ( i have a honda civic ) , but it fit just fine . rear-facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat , so if you have 2 kids , you would have to put the seats up further , but if you are short , that will likely not be an issue . i had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly -- he installed it in minutes and did not need any foam pieces to make it fit properly ! it was a perfect fit on its own . pros : 1. it is the best car seat you can get ! 2. has side impact protection -- also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep 3. the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats 4. the seat is very well cushioned , soft fabric 5. fits fine a small car even rear facing ( i have a civic ) 6. it 's heavy so its not going anywhere ! 7. works for up to 65 pounds , so we will get a lot of use out of the seat 8. she loves it ! cons : 1. it is large/heavy ( though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem ) 2. the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child , but you need to pull straight out and not up 3. it is expensive i highly recommend this seat ( we have the onyx fabric ) . it is large , heavy and expensive , but it is the best ! ! i had buyer 's remorse for a few minutes , but i figured it is the best seat on the market right now and $ 300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter . i did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat ! very pleased with this seat ! also , please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician ( check with your local children 's hospital ) . improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants . something very easy to prevent
1	i had wished that i had bought this potty chair from the very begining . i bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking . i never could find the place that is was leaking . so i purchased babybjorn green potty chair . my son loved it the moment that i took it out of the box . he wanted to use it in the family room . i love it because it is only 2 pieces . it 's so super easy to clean . and it is green my sons favorite color . great price and great size . i recommend this item
1	i orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things . it got too heavy everything would n't fit . so now i use it to hold his baby tylenol , etc . it is really nice .
0	i have seen this product ( and others similar to it ) . as an rn , we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the `` cuteness '' of items that are geared only to be sold , not to be useful . although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful , and some essential , it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately . in this way , you can check for quality and longevity . put together your own kit .
0	when i ordered this product , i was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it . i was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it . this happiness only lasted two days before the mobile , lights , and music stopped working . i am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product . i have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby .
1	my two and half year old kept telling me he wanted to stand up to go to the potty , like his older brother and daddy . a friend recomended this product and when my little one saw it he was so excited . he loves the fact that he can flush it all by himself
1	i love these cups and better yet so does my baby ! they are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink . she has no idea that it 's not a bottle . it has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier . thank you
1	i love this bumper . it is n't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely , without bunching . and the price is much more reasonable than the $ $ bumpers that go with bedding sets . mostly i can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings . i know his arms and legs wo n't get tangled in the railings , but he also can breathe . great product . it is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib .
1	i was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles.most of the potties i looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and i didn`t want anything like that.this potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings.just what the doctor prescribed
0	i could n't wait to get it . i got so excited when it finally arrived ! so i used it right away ! sooo disapointed ! it did not get anything out at all , it is soooo weak ! the one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from target and it works ! but this nasal-clear is no good . do not buy it
0	i ordered this item based on the great rating it got , yet when i received it i was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong . i ordered a medium based on the manufacturer 's notes yet when received found i needed a longer one . after researching how to return , since it came with no information on this , i found out you can not return this product from this store . i wanted to warn everyone before they purchase .
0	i purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so . i have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units . the sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem . weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that . i would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them
0	i bought this buggy board because i was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board ( wheel kept unscrewing ) ... however , i have two strollers i like to use so i had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board . today i called customer service because one strap broke ... i was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break ... ? ? ? ? ? ? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time ! i was told not to use it in cold weather ... i only use it on the weekends anyway so it 's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months . please save yourself money and grief and get another board
1	this item is a great idea for people on the go like me . it has removable slots so that you can place a larger bowl in it plus your baby food jar .
0	important : find a mobile with the option of it working , while being silent w/out music . i thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes , but then i quickly realized , i could n't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they did n't put that option on it ! how can this be ? it is a $ 40+ dollar mobile . my baby just wanted to see it go , but the music , and sliding beads put him over the edge . this mobile is too loud , and the sliding beads are loud as well . it stimulates baby too much . even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud . the motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great , but `` tiny love '' ruined it by not putting a `` silent running feature button '' on it . i 'd pay $ 60 for it if it would just be quiet ! ! ! if this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful . as it is now , i ca n't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest . even then , the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state , because it is too loud . i think i shall pry it open and try to break the speaker . i am serious . i rated it with one star , because i can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state . if he is the least bit tired , it overstimulates him and makes him cry .
1	these cloths are awesome . they smell great and do n't crumble like other brands . they work well for sponge baths when there 's no time for a real bath ! love them
0	i should have checked this out before registering for it . the lid wo n't stay shut , the bottom wipes brown , the unit leaks . i contacted the manufacturer . when telling him about the lid not staying shut , he asked , `` are you sure there is n't a ghost in the house '' ... they offered to replace it if i returned it to them , offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products . after reading these reviews i think i 'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product
1	i bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind , which i love , come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin . some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often - you really are supposed to do that , because otherwise you will get an breast infection , especially if you live in the south where it 's warm and humid . i recommend the ultra thin pads , the other ones that come in the variety pack are just `` ok ''
1	this is an excellent product . it is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about sids . i felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib ... and that she would n't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats . i was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton ... and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material . we even had family members that thought that someone had made the cribshield for us .
1	the car seat itself is awesome , but the condition it arrived in was awful . the box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind . there was nothing covering the seat ( like a plastic bag ) so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat . it was a gift for my grandson for christmas so i did n't have time to return it and hope for a timely return . it took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat . simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me .
1	i am very pleased with this product.it arrived quickly , same as pictured , keeps baby in place insuring a goodnights sleep , im glad the headrest was not elevated , elevated positioners make baby sink into bedding and could cause suffication.again , im pleased would purchase for any future children i might have
0	i looked amazing on the computer but let me tell you it was ugly ! we had recived it my mail and it was cheap plastic fake wood ! ! ! needless to say it went back ! ! ! i also was upset by the way it was delivered it was left on my front patio blocking my door in the pouring rain ... so i am sure the crib was wet as well
0	this is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice . i thought , `` ooh what a nifty idea , a head bumper ! '' the whole idea was great ; but if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine , then the head bumper guard is a waste . i actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything . because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers . do n't ask me how he did this . the good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine . other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib
1	great for organizing baby 's food in your diaper bag . caution : not leak-proof , be sure to properly seal leftovers ! love the slots that hold spoons .
1	i bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features ... ..overall i am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it ... .but few things i wish it had is ... .one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention.overall for the price it is good
0	we bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first , however after about 2 months the 1st receiver , ( it came with two ) , just suddenly stoped working ! i thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen , but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working ! there must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as i can see from reading the other reviews that we 're not the only family having problems . save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand/model
1	we love the diaper dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family ! it is super simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for 2-3 months vs. a week ( i.e . diaper genie ) ! from reading the other reviews , i think i can clear a few things up - it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product . first , there are 2 versions of this pail - a larger called diaper dekor plus and regular size called simply diaper dekor . thus , there are 2 different sizes of refills , plus and regular . you can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail - there is a sticker that will have the model on there - if you do not see plus anywhere , you will need to buy regular refills - the plus will not fit , and vice versa . secondly , the refills are very easy to insert , you simply follow the directions which come with the unit . basically , you remove the plastic insert , wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top - the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail - knot tied in the bottom of the new refill . if you have a unit , this will make sense - if you have n't bought one yet , i probably just confused you - but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do ! last but not least , the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all - i personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent . it 's not like i will be sniffing inside the pail or anything , so it does n't matter - afterall , once the refill is in the pail , no scent will come out - not even dirty diapers ! unfortunately , it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores . i hope this has helped ! we 've had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it ! it is a godsend ! no smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing ! not many other units will allow you to store up to 3 weeks of diapers without a single scent
0	i like the concept of an elevated design . they should make the sides breathable . i have had my son sleeping on this since he came home . this has been 6 weeks so far . he twitches and moves his legs and arms , and such . typical baby stuff . he ends up slidding down in between the wedges . i tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up . you would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in . he slides no matter what . when i put the towell to high his head slid off the edge . good idea needs work
1	the crib arrived much sooner than i was quoted . i was told 3 weeks , it came in 4 days . very prompt . it is a beautiful crib , i love it . the directions are a bit lax . it took my husband and i two hours to put it together . mainly because the instructions only showed how to put together the ends and the drawer , and not the rest of the crib ! we finally figured it out . other than that the crib is beautiful
1	i absolutely love this walker . the songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained . i also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere . there are also great safety features such as the `` grip strips '' on the bottom . the wheels are very easily manuevered also . i would definitely recommend this product to other moms
0	i should have read the reviews . i purchased this item , and it quit working after a week of normal use
1	its a little hard to adjust , but its definitely worth it . we 've used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller . folds away easily and does n't take up a lot of space . i also love the pockets on the sides where i can store my keys , phone , water bottle , etc
1	i have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity . at first , i was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok . so i took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby , ... it stopped ticking . the baby was not moving , but just it 's heart and/or lungs working keeps the unit ticking . it detects even when you blow on the sensor . maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity , since ceiling fans , etc might activate it , but i was truly amazed with the sensitivity . you can turn the tick down so it is not too bothersome , it is like a clock ticking , about once a second when baby is ok , if it stops ticking for about 30 seconds.. a noticeable alarm will ring .
1	my two year old son , loves this talking phone he carries the thing everywhere . we love the time and quailty that he spends playing with this wonderful toy
0	i read all the amazon reviews but still decided to go with the avent sippy cup since i had relatively good experiences with the avent bottles . unfortunately , leaking is a real problem with these cups . not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well i try to fasten the lid , but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips . he ends up with a mouth full of milk . so much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup . i orginally used playtex and he liked that well enough . i only switched because the playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear . now , after wasting money on avent , i 'll go back to playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try . i do n't usually write amazon reviews but i figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble . unless you want milk everywhere , i would definitely avoid these cups .
1	i love my avent pump . even though i knew i would be returning to work when my son was just 6 weeks old , i was reluctant to spend the money on an expensive electric pump until i knew if breastfeeding would be right for us . now , my son is almost 6 months old and i 'm still using my manual pump . i take 2 15-minute breaks each day and find that i can easily keep up with my son 's milk needs . on the days that i have trouble getting my milk to flow , i find that it has much more to do with my stress level than the pump 's efficieny . ( on those nights , i nurse on one side while i pump on the other . ) i would definitely recommend this pump as a great value for the price
0	i bought several versions of the bundle me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit ! i am so frustrated by this ! why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe ? ? ? we took our car seat to the katie cares safety check today and they took all of the accessories off . we had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe . save your money and buy a version that goes over the seat and baby , not under ... kidopotomus makes one .
0	i found the product highly unsafe as a stroller . the handle is very flimsy , and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller . also the wheels do not lock properly and safely . its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve
0	i purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area . i was totally wrong ! ! ! every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it , which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand . forget it if you have to get through in a hurry , 'cause it needs to be readjust to open and close it . plus the gray bumper on mine is loose , so if i can get the top bracket to fit correctly , the bottom one is to lose and not secure . i have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so i can close it , only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes . i would have returned this gate , but i trashed the box before i installed it
1	it 's kind of hard to get really excited about a changing pad , it gets the job done , it folds rather compactly , i think it 's well worth the money
0	we had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart . i chose this one because of its features and colors . my daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it . we tried for days to get her to use this , but she never would . so , we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves .
0	i was so excited when i recieved this humidifier at my baby shower . but after several tries , i finally returned it . this product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically . well , the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on , my baby wakes up crying ! ! ! note that i live 2 miles from an airforce base , and the planes do n't even wake her ! ! ! ! do n't buy this product
0	baby age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set , refusing changing it to the crib set . i have to return it by amazon a-z guarantee , wasting a lot of time .
0	i have two double strollers , 1 front and back graco and this side by side aria . i do n't use the front/back graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time ( 2 1/2 year and 1 year . i had the peg mt single first and loved it . so thought the product quality would be the same . used it for 2 years with no problems . but have to say stay clear of the aria design . our side by side had numerous pieces fall off , cup holder , seat clip , logo tag , clip to hold trays in place , etc . its not durable at all ! we even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too ! we took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off . my sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product . she has since bought the maclaren single and i am in the process of purchasing the maclaren twin techno . it may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second
1	i bought this dresser despite some of the negative reviews and believe that it is a good product for the price . the dresser seems very sturdy and everything came undamaged . it only took my husband and i an hour to put together
1	i really liked this swing -- i have the older model papasan swing , nothing was wrong with it i just wanted the new model . i loved the pink and the fact that i could plug it in
1	to bring the co-sleeper up to the height of the bed , these leg extensions are the best bet . yes , as someone else said , they do make it a little shaky . so if you are not planning to attach the co-sleeper to your bed , you may want to leave the height alone . ( you 'll be getting up anyway , so it probably does n't matter how tall it is . ) but once attached to the bed with the anchor strap , rather than free-standing , it was very secure .
0	i read other reviews that said it was headache , but i went ahead and purchased this item because it 's less expense than anything i else i saw . i should have listened ... i ordered it in feb , it is now may and we still do n't have the dresser together . there were pieces missing , and a major piece broken . when you try to call , the line is busy . i had to hang up and redial , what felt like forever . they said my piece would come in 3 weeks , it was more like 7 weeks . the piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it , but when it came , it had no rails . so , i said i wanted to return the entire thing , they were fine with it , but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back . so , at this point in time , we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that i can have a dresser in my son 's room .
0	we have had nothing but problems with the receiver . we have it in our kitchen and it 's no more than 30 feet from our son 's bedroom . any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal . the beep is very annoying because it wo n't stop until you move out of the way . if we open the fridge door it beeps also . we 've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck . it is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds , even at low volume , until you change the frequency . when it works the sound quality is very good , although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep . we recommend the angelcare movement sensor and monitor by bebe sounds . the sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby 's mattress . it senses each time your baby takes a breath . if there is no movement it sounds an alarm . great insurance against sids !
0	buy anything . buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you 'll get pretty much the same end result . i do n't have the pink diaper champ because i have a little boy but it 's still a diaper champ and it is horrible . i had a diaper genie with my older son ( now 4 ) and gave it to my brother . i wanted to try something else and was drawn to the champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag ... .woo hoo ... no refills ! ! ! so for three months now ( that 's how old my little butterball is now ) i 've used the diaper champ and the first day it 's not so bad ( maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of lysol i spray in there and the fact that i use forceflex trash bags ( for the prayer that they wo n't break when i 'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop ) which also have odor shield ( so the bags start out smelling so nice ! ) but already by day two , my husband is walking in the nursery saying `` hoooooooney , it smellllllls ! i clean the thing all the time ... .the stench remains . this week i ordered my diaper genie online . i feel like throwing a party when it gets here . i 'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house .
1	i read some other reviews that were poor , but i disagree . my son loves this toy . he smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room . it plays music continually for 12 minutes . so , in the middle of the night when he wakes up , i turn it on and he 's asleep by the time it runs out . we have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy . however , it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees . this completely contradicts the interactive play mode , since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons .
0	i use this at work where i have infants up to toddlers , we have to repeat the process 3 times before we ever get an accurate reading . the under the arm , old traditional thermomaters are better
1	i bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant , and so far i 've been very pleased . i wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when i 'm out running errands . there are just a few parts , so assembly , disassembly and cleaning is very easy . but the best part about the pump , is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it . i needed a larger one than what came standard with it . it makes pumping more comfortable . the first few times i used it , i considered switching to an electric pump because i was n't pumping much milk . but the more i pumped , the more milk i produced . this breastpump is worth every penny . i recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds , but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby .
0	we asked for 2 of these and got both . the material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer . it was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet . it was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big . they ended up in the closet in no time
0	i have this and have used it for about 5 months . i have never had problems with it starting , but it drives me crazy with the dripping all over the counter and the amount of condensation . i am looking for a new sterilizer because of this . i do not recommend .
0	good things : ( 1 ) baby loves watching the hanging toys . ( 2 ) the nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant . bad things : ( 1 ) very troublesome to assemble . the supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads . in the most critical support structure ( the kickstand ) i could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out . but i did get it together well enough to use . however , i considered returning it to the store during assembly . ( 2 ) the vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use . ( 3 ) baby can not reach the toys , even at 3 months of age , and we have a very tall baby . ( 4 ) toys are very easily removed from their `` holes '' so that you ca n't really move the chair without the toys falling out . ( 5 ) the rocker has a very big `` footprint '' . it takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table
1	my daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out . then , we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic . amen ! i do n't care how many parts there are -- it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting
1	i feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking . it is perfect for my girl . i do understand why people with boys may have issues , but if you have a girl it is just wonderful . i have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better . it has a great weight to it so it 's not flimsy , and it fits my girls bum so nicely , and the cushion is very firm yet soft . the handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool , sit and pull herself back . my friend has the pricey bjorn and while that is nice , i saved $ 15 on something that works just as well
1	they 're a little pricey , but they work great . they are easy to clean , dry quickly , and catch almost all the mess my boys make
1	we love this tub still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old . the incline position is great when they are n't quite ready to sit on their own . we used to just place this over our kitchen sink give her baths there . now , we place it inside our regular bathtub because she is n't quite ready to be in the big tub yet .
0	if you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation , this item is not for you . since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her . she was bored to tears ( literally ) every time we put her in the lounger ( the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting ) . i thought it was a cool concept , however , my daughter did not . she did much better in her papasan , or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to , but have the option to look around and play as well . looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter
1	i purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago . i was disappointed that i was n't able to use it for my second pregnancy , most likely because it had been dropped too many times . this new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it much more user friendly . also , one set of batteries ( 4 aa ) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks . the batteries in my old one would last 5 days if i was lucky . my daughter just turned two in january 06 and is extremely smart , verbally advanced and a joy to be around . by 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the abc 's . by 18 months she could recognize all of the letters . i believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3 . do i credit the baby plus ? who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby # 2 .
1	my husband purchased this bag for me when i recently took a trip solo with my daughter . it seemed to be more troublesome than helpful . i ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because i could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition . on the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor . when i arrived at my destination i restitched the bag and thought that maybe i had been careless in my handling . on the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger , though it was still a small airport . when i arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result . the damage to the bag is so bad that i can never use it again . this bag should be labeled as disposable . though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality . i would not recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer
1	i was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry . i am so glad i did . i have only had to empty it about every 6-7days and it is simple and odor free . even when full there is no odor ! i didnt need to put in a refill for 3months . the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts . in comparison , its cheaper ! i would recommend this to anyone
1	i got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it ! this playpen is so wonderful , very colorful sooo easy to set it up . i 'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it . i received great reviews on this gear also so do n't be dissapointed to grab one like it ! ! ! awesome playpen ! !
1	baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles . quick cleanup , quick fill up . love the nipple variety too . because of the liners , it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces , etc . would highly recommend
0	i recently purchased this booster as well as the britax starriser booster seat ( i have two cars/two toddlers and an infant ) . my children argue over who gets to ride in the starriser . for some reason they are not as comfortable in the parkway . my theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel `` too snug '' in it . they even look uncomfortable in it . the one advantage of the parkway over the starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep . if i had to do it over , i would have purchased two of the starrisers instead of the parkway . btw , i purchased the britax companion for my infant and i love it
1	my daughter is just learning how to self-feed and these placemats are great . i 've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are . this product solves that problem . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off . however , i do not find this to be a major problem . also , i tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table . great tip . thanks . this is a great product for kids learning to eat
1	i bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when i have him until my son is born in june . i love the look , style and safety of this seat . the only thing that i thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height . my nephew is 22 '' and he is almost on the second to last adjustment . also the side impacts do n't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side . my nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it . the upright position is something i like , i have never seen him sweat in it , he seems to have growing room , the canopy covers him fine , and i think it is the most comfortable to carry . his parents are using an eddie bauer and i know alot of people ( including me in the past ) that use graco and other brands and they seem roomier , but not as safe . also i have n't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways , i do n't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat , i guess that 's just the few of us who are n't body builders . my nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat , it 's a good thing that the seat is n't too heavy itself . i would recommend this seat , but i ca n't explain the other reviews , so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone
0	this toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy . the splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin , it can be quite painful . i plan on trying the baby bjorn seat , it looks like it would be more comfortabl
0	i 'm on child number 2 with this chair , and my complaints are the same . 1 . they tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything . my son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray . 2 . it is a cleaning nightmare . i am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair ! good points : -pop off tray -divider that keeps them from slipping out -cool colors i tried a friend 's cheap evenflo chair and i loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less
0	i do n't even know where to begin . eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids . ( 1 1/2 and 6 months old ) instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him , she would cover her face and cry ! he would go off all by himself , which was really creepy in the middle of the night . and he broke after a couple of months . now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house . he 's defantly not worth the mone
1	i love this chair , and so does my 6 month old . it 's super easy to clean , to recline the seat , or to adjust the height . the toy that comes with it is cute , too - i love the music it plays
1	the crib tent is great ! we originally got it to keep our cats out , but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too . : ) until ... at 27 months , he learned how to reach through the crib slats undo the zipper ! ! ! ! : -o so now we 're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week ! it is hard to change sheets with the crib tent , but just get the `` ultimate crib sheet '' it 's a piece of cake ! : ) also , it is *possible* to put down the side rail of the crib , but this does lower the tent too can bop you in the head . ;
1	i bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and i 'd have to say the reviews i read about on the titan were dead on . my 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using . i also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward i can still use this seat - i wish i had bought this seat from the get go
0	the image showing for this spoon set is not correct . the image is for bendable spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old . when you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant
1	i have a 6 month old who absoutely loves this walker . we started using this when he was only 4 months old and being the wiggly , active baby he is , he loved being able to push himself around . now , along with his `` walking '' , he loves to push the buttons to hear the music and see the lights . along with that , he likes to pull and pet the plush toys on the side while `` chatting '' with them . this is a great walker ; just always remember to keep an eye on baby at all times ! i highly recommend this for those babies who love to move around on their own . it also provides mom and dad with about 25+ minutes of catch-up-with-to-do-list time ! !
1	i bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all . i love the color , the material is easy to wash , and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable . i have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly . my only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months . the bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving . other than that , what you see is what you get ! worth every penny ! ! !
0	i bought this product for childproofing purposes . i was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer 's instructions state not to install gate against drywall ( which was not in the item description ) , so i can not use it where i needed it . also , the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close , especially with a small child in your arms .
0	i purchased this rail today for my daughter 's crib that `` converts '' into a toddler bed . everything on the outside of the box looked great , until we got home , put it together and put it on the crib . there is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed . also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space . after playing with it for awhile , i decided to look over the instructions again . it states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed . my question is `` why did n't it say this on the outside of the box ? ! ''
1	i love this bra ! it is very comfortable , i hardly notice i have it on . the soft stretchy material is perfect . the closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them . i am glad i bought this nursing bra and i highly recommend it
1	very convenient carseat , can be placed in the combi double stroller , which is the only side by side stroller that i have seen that you can attach an infant seat into . ( and i 've searched a lot ) the carseat is comprable to the peg perego primo viaggo ( whichi also have ) but you can ; t connect that one into the aria twin , the peg perego side by side . the seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage , and very soft with the foam insert . it 's easy to get into the car with or without the base . only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you ca n't have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps are n't long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out . also , our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat , so it must be pretty comfortable
1	we 've used this seat when traveling , and everyday use at home . when our son was about 15 months old , i put the highchair away and started using this . it can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser ! ! it folds down so it can be put away easily if you 're having guests , unlike a big highchair ! great chair !
1	we bought this swing for our 11 month old daughter , and she loves it ! we attached it to our back porch easily enough , and she swings in it every day ! we 've had it for about a month and it is still her favorite toy ! the only issue that we have had is that it hangs slightly crooked because of the way that they put the hooks on the swing at the factory . the are n't both facing the same direction , which is something that we cant fix , but it is n't bad enough to not use the swing or to cause any problems . its more irritating than anything . also , the swing seems secure and safe . we 've not had any issues with safety , or even any close calls
1	this is a great price for a 4 pc set . ( i got ours at walmart for $ 35 ) the comforter is not thick and plushy . its very thin and stiff . but then again , for the price , its ok . the sheets are adorable . we bought a very soft , fuzzy dora blanket to go with it . but the comforter that comes with it is definately cute . maybe after a few washes it will soften up some . i would still buy it again for the price . but if you are looking for a thick , soft warm comfoter , then this is not the one you want
0	this brand is just awful ! it 's made of cheap , flimsy particle board . it dents and dings very easily . most inportantly , the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out . not only is it horribly made , but it 's dangerous ! do not buy !
0	i bought this for my baby who , at 6 months was barely 16 lbs . she did n't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old , so she was rear facing for a long time . she loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well , i could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and i could n't see my baby again . the water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it . we ca n't find any leaks but there 's little water . the little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart . sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday . it never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part , while it was fun to kick at , was just worthless . my sister in law wanted one for my niece but i am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this
1	we have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece . they are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market . they are made well , stand up to a lot of washing , and are soft and comfortable for baby . the dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch . note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months , not for a newborn . we started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets . two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night- all you need over pj 's to make baby feel more secure and comfortable . a great night 's sleep for all !
1	i use the medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps do n't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh . i love the heavy advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle
1	my wife and i just finished putting this crib together . it took a total of 25 minutes start to finish . the instructions were extremely easy to follow . we bought this exact crib in honey oak 18 months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well , we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two . our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together . the only adjustments we have done , where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower . even that process only took a matter of minutes . i have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up . when ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough , but the crib pieces inside are very well packed , padded , and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish . the super saver free shipping arrived at our door 6 days from date of purchase . i have never wrote a review for an online purchase before , but we are so pleased with our two cribs that i wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib . p.s . i 'm a physician and this crib could not be any safer ... no solid side walls or backing ... just the well spaced rounded slates all the way around and no moving part
0	i have had nothing but problems with this company . i was missing bolts for an item . i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me . they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty . took care of that , but still waiting on bolts . order the piece in december , it is now april and still not able to assemble
1	these are wonderful ! my baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months , so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks . we were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one . after about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night ( as she did when she was swaddled ) . so the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms . while i did n't notice shrinkage i did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit , but this has n't been a problem . sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth , but she has to reach for it - it does n't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe . i did n't like that these do n't have sleeves so i tried carter 's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter . those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she has also outgrown the small size sleep sack , but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow . i did n't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester . i wanted to use cotton . but we 've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one . also , we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby . we 've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally . we 've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face . so after everything we 've tried we 've loved these sleep sacks from day one
1	if you 're worried about sids ( loose blankets in the crib ) , or whether or not your little one is warm at night ... look no more ... halo sleepsack wearable cotton or fleece is the way to go ! ! ! ! i love them , and know that my little guy is warm during those chilly nights
1	i bought this item a year ago and so far it is still in great shape . we use it to hold all my little girl 's stuffed animals and she has alot of them ! on occasions we do include her heavy toys -- no problem at all . we live in an apt and it helps having a storage bin that does n't take up too much space , but big enough to store away toys
0	these bowls are not worth the money . they do not stay on the table at all !
0	i loved this at first . but after two months of daily use the thing broke . i cant get it back together . i think i will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside
0	i would have rated this item 0 stars , if that were an option . we discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation . fortunately , we discovered this because we were moving , not because a piece of furniture fell . i shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped
1	this is a great sterilizer , it 's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings . i bought it when my son was born and after a year , i 'm still using it . it works great , saves time , and has an auto shut-off function when the steaming cycle is complete .
0	my mother inlaw bought this dresser for us as a gift for her first grandson . as most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom , can be a very very exciting feeling . when we recieved our dresser , we did not open it right away . once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box , to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half . we called stork craft and reordered the part . the representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us . my husband and i wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel . i then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2-3 weeks before the package can be shipped . that same day i called amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house . til this very day we are still waiting for the right side panel . my suggestion- please read every review before purchasing any items rom fstork craft ... ... ... there furniture and customer service is not reliable . our babies deserve better ... ... ... .. don '' t you think
1	i was looking for a double stroller that i could get in and out of my sedan easily . i did n't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space , but they are also very heavy . this stroller is light , and i can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand . plus , because my kids are heavy enough to push , i am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller . because it is side-by-side , it can be a tight fit going through some doors , but i have never been unable to get through a door . my husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily , but with 6 months of lots of use , we have had no problems . the sun visors have bent at an angle when storing , but i can still use them fine and i like that they rotate down , so you can angle them with the sun . i am so glad that i bought this rather than a larger , more expensive , heavier tandem stroller
0	too big and bulky to sit easily on top of the canopy . it may be my stroller ( maclaren quest ) that it the issue , but i wish i never bought this product . my baby hates it too , because she ca n't see where we 're walking to
0	you do n't want this one . although the fabric is appealing ( calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers ) this cover will not fit most shopping carts . it only fits the carts found at small city super markets . if you are a suburbian shopper you 'll have to spend the bucks for a more satisfactory product
0	this sounded like a great item . however , it has proven to be useless . first , it wo n't stop a child from opening the door . second , when the door is opened , the guard falls out . when the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut , thus the child ca n't pinch their fingers . however , the `` catch '' , which goes behind the door , is too small , enabling it to fall through .

1	this crib is well built and functional . the drawer is a nice and convenient feature . the finish is good for an inexpensive crib . assembly was easy with good instructions included . we plan on using this crib for our next baby as well
1	my daughter ( 2 1/2 yrs old ) likes this cot , a lot . i bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my m-i-l is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib . she sleeps on it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the afternoon , which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her ( darkened ) room . it suits this purpose well and i intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we do n't have to haul her port-a-crib . the only disadvantage is that she can get out of it , of course , but ... it 's a cot ! she began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time , so i figured i 'd buy it for my m-i-l at home . it does the trick and my baby thinks it 's special . i tell her that it 's only for when grandma s is over ( b/c she wanted to start sleeping/napping in it all the time ) . naturally , i 'd prefer she take a longer nap , so i told her it 's for special days only , when grandma s is here . so now she uses it to `` tuck in '' her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night . i love it , and it seems comfortable , very portable and handy . i would recommend it . the only reason i 'm not rating it 5 stars is that i have yet to use it on a weekend trip , but i wanted to review it now , in case you were wondering whether or not to get it . i think it 's very much worth it , but everyone 's different . it 's relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends . also , it is very sturdy supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all . hope that helps
0	we bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but , the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close , and hard to open , specially the one that goes between the legs , it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle that i 'm afraid i 'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them , and is complicated to align them to finally buckle . in fact i had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips
0	i love the other sleep sacks , you can see my full review of them on their web pages . but this sack has different fabric which i really , really do n't like . it is n't actually quilted . it is woven to look like it is . the material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off . it also catches on any hang nails or rough skin . when it is warm i use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold i use the fleece ( polyester ) ones . great sacks , just annoying fabric with this one
0	i bought this after renting the hospital-grade medela lactima . big difference . the backpack is compact , sleek , and inconspicuous but the pump sucks . it has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you . well , after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off . if i lower the suction to a comfortable , reasonable level , the pump is way too fast . if i slow the pump to mimic my baby 's speed , the suction is excruciatingly painful -- and it still does n't pump slow enough . i am very unhappy with this and wish we 'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead . the little cooler is cute , but it 's tough to actually fit the frozen insert ( `` blue '' plastic thing ) and four bottles in there . and it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles ( it will pump into dr. browns evenflo bottles too , any regular mouth size bottles ) or bags . i love the setup , just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other . i ca n't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options . : (
1	i love this item /it has soothing music , sounds and animation . easy operation , baby loves it too . arrived quickly and well packaged instructions on manufacturers box . thanks fisher pric
1	i would like to ditto ( and thank ! ) the reviewer who suggested the cvs brand covers . after reading her review , i purchased the covers from cvs.com . then i thought about checking at walgreen 's , and sure enough , they carry them ( same price as cvs , 40 for $ 5.99 ) . i just picked up a box today . so i will soon have a bunch of covers , but i do n't care . i just love this thermometer . i actually have the one with the light on it . outstanding product
1	i actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby 's cradle ( we have two cats and did n't want them to nap in it while the baby was n't in it ) . i 've used it once for my pak n ' play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood . since it was such a nice day i let her nap in in the stroller ( it fully reclines ) with netting covering the entire stroller . i feel , that for such a low price , this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for
0	i received this as a gift and loved it at first . but after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up . i was bummed too because i loved it so much . if you do buy it , be careful when you handle it - it 's not as durable as it seems
1	we had the forerunner ( diaper genie 1 ) . no matter what i did , it still stunk . i would add baking soda after poopy diapers , line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners . it always smelled like poop ! ! one day it broke , so we looked for a replacement . i was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one , but we thought we would give it a try . it 's amazing . my daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench ! ! ! also , it 's so easy . no twisting . just put the diaper thru the trap door . it 's easy to load and change cartridges . this is definately a great buy ! ! !
0	i have the safari tt dbl jogger from in step and i bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent . i have seen this product work well on single strollers , but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes , so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid 's faces . i 've used a binder clip to keep it in place , but it still blows back more than i think it should..
1	i also own the bundle me w/fluffy heavy winter liner we could not have lived without it ! i was excited to see this trendy , light-weight , weather resistant version for spring . i 'll admit i would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at $ 39.99 . my $ 59.99 dismay soon evaporated-it is so sleek and functional ! no more struggling with bulky snowsuits , jackets and sweaters ( which never seem to fit baby anyway ) easily unzips so as not to overheat . love the little pocket for binky . velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller ( no need to buy two ! )
0	i 've tried lots of storage bags , and by far the medela ranks the lowest . these spill , you have to store them upright in the freezer ... and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people , storing milk upright is just too hard to do . these bags do not have a ziplock seal on them , which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry ( like if you have more than one kid and you work ) . buy the gerber or the lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them . they can both be stored flat for more convenience , and they can stand on their own . pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump ( the medela bags ) , or you can use your medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a gerber or lansinoh storage bag for ease . i use the medela lactina plus , and i find that this method works the best for me . simple , clean and easy .
0	my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away , much more so than his small potty . however , he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard . he gets wet , the floor and his step stool are all wet . clean up is a nightmare . it 's in the trash now .
1	i had no idea that the bjorn was so expensive , since i got it as a gift at my baby shower . but knowing what i know now , id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it . my baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times , the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep . ( she needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much ) being that it was so used , im super glad that its easy to put on and take off . the durability of it is awesome also and i still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use . now that my baby is getting older , i switch her forward and she loves that . she can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her . the ease of the clips is a godsend , so that i can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me . i tried some other carriers , but all the straps and clips were so confusing . plus alot of the others arent reversible . you can only have your baby face inwards . this is totally worth the money guys !
0	this tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all . it was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while i was washing her , etc . however , after using the tub about 10 times , it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside . basically , the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled . she was n't hurt , but was very scared . keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so i do n't think her weight was an issue
0	i bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use . the tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of . also , it was close to impossible to keep clean , unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use . it was very unwieldy to travel with . it folded up , but did n't stay together and so was not very portable . because it was so cumbersome , it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke . the cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit , so now it is in the garbage where it belongs . i only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average . yes , it was cheap , but as they say , the poor man buys everything twice , and now i 'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster .
1	i purchased this product for my hubby 's vehicle and we love not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time . it works great , highly recommended
1	i am a disposable diaper mom , however , for night time or extra protection i throw the bummis wrap over the diaper and have never had a leak . they wash up very nice and the velcro stays very strong . it is by far the best wrap i 've used
1	i bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield . i had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and i was n't able to get a drop out because the shields did n't stay in place . if you have biggre breasts i would suggest using this pump
1	i do like this organizer , since the stroller i have does n't have any holders on itself ( for the `` pusher '' ) . there is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder . i do n't have any problem with this organizer at all but i put it at 4 stars because i would like to say that the majority of time that i 'm out using the stroller , i 'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder . we 're used to the graco-designed strollers that do come with 2 drink holders . it 's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink ... but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink . : -
0	i bought this for my son , who was just over 2 years old at the time . within about 9 or 10 months , the railing broke at the plastic hinge . obviously , since this is major stress point for the product , it can not be fixed with just some heavy duty glue . i was disappointed that this railing did not last longer
1	this has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk , formula and now baby food jars . it heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it . i wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child . i think that this is a very good investment , especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it does n't heat anything evenly ! !
1	these can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you do n't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry . i have small breasts so i could wear them in any bra , and i did n't have a huge leakage problem , so i changed the foam twice a day . the only problem i had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it . i think it got damp and was n't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after i stopped using them . bottom line : the relief was worth any minor inconvenience
1	this baby gate is great ! ! ! the top of my stairs both walls going in 2 different angles and i am so glad that i found this gate ! it works great and i hav n't had any problams with it at all . i installed it as soon as i got it . and i didnt seem to have any problams installing it . i have a 2 yr old and all moms and dads out there know how 2 yr olds can be at trying out new things ! it is a tall gate so he cant lean over it and fall . all the bars on it are vertical so he cant climb it . and the lock on it is easy to use but he cant unlock it . the gate is made out of metal and is welded together so you dont have to worry about the bars coming out like you do with the wooden gates . i highly recomend this gate for any room any doorway and its great at the top of the stairs
1	i have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age . we love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry . just make sure the suction cup is wet and it wo n't fall off the wall . sizewize , it 's basically a perfect fit in our tub , which is slightly tapered from head to toe , but i could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub .
0	i bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe . well , after one month i returned it because it is the worst car seat ever . the car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward . he never looked comfortable . the car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable . these things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky . this car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it . the carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it . the canopy is also terrible because it barely works . it only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky . i was constantly having to change the direction i was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face . ( unlike the graco where you can pull the shade all the way down ) i hated returning this because i really liked the looks of it but i had to for my sons sake . i bought the graco seat in the blackwell print ( which is an o.k . looking fabric ) . we are both soooo much happier . he looks comfortable and a little more reclined . the sun is n't in his face and i have $ 130 extra dollars that i can spend on something else . i think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks ( as i did ) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price ( as i did ) . but in actuality it just sucks . i wish that graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional .
1	we had a very fussy baby , and we used these , and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned . i was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape . i considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so i could use it over with child number two
1	i purchased this carrier when my son was just a week old and used it for nearly one year . it was on clearance at babies r us for only fifteen dollars . it was well worth the price . the only problem i ever encountered with it was the back support was minimal . i do have frequent back problems and it does not take much to aggravate it . the weight of my son did get a little daunting at about the six month mark . my brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him . i would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase , if you do n't go ahead . i personally would still make this purchase . another plus is that is does not look as silly as those women carrying around their child in a sling . people never gave me those looks with this !
0	do not believe the manufactures claims that you do n't need a jacket if you have this bunting . we had a 7am enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it . it had a hood ( that could be unzipped ) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing . now she has outgrown it and i bought one of these as a replacement . there is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well . the zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old . yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up ! it did keep her just about warm enough with a coat , hat and mittens at a temp of 35f , but i want something that you can use without a coat . after much research i am returning this ( after a single outing ) and getting a little kazook instead ( which zips all the way up and has a hood )
1	i love the baby bjorn bib- it is excellent for protecting my 1 year old son 's clothes as he learns to feed himself . it is great for car rides too - i can place cheerios in the pocket and he can feed himself a little snack . the only drawback is that with my son being small , the highchair tray and the pocket are the same height . however , as he grows taller , they wo n't interfere with each other
0	i agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ( $ 250+ ) models . in an effort to save money i started with this one . but i quickly realized i 'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk . i ended up getting the medela pump in style and loved it . i just wish i 'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one . for those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model , here are my two cents : try this one if ... - you have a very abundant milk supply - you only plan to pump one or twice a month - you would n't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period invest the money in a higher-end model if ... - you 're going back to work - your milk supply is medium to low - you plan to pump more than two or three times per month - you are opposed to giving your baby any formula , ever ( with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency ) also , it 's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you 're done ( unlike this one )
1	i thought a fold-up tub was a great idea , but we 've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months , the maximum age of use . i paid only $ 10 , so not much loss . she objected the first time we tried it , at about 2 weeks , and so we went back to sponge baths for a while . i would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub . toys helped distract her when she was a little older . my daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months , though she was always 97 % + in height weight . to wash her backside , you of course have to take her out of the tub . i usually forgot to plug it before filling it , and so usually had water all over the floor . instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink ; it certainly does n't fit in our oval bath sink . maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink . the folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf . for a little tub bath , i liked it . it was good for a quick bath or to really soak her , but in the end i prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed , which i think got my daughter cleaner
0	exactly 3 months after i bought this stroller , a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off , making it dangerous and impossible to use . luckily i bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund ( in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously ) . when i tested the stroller at the store , i thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it would n't last long ( which is why i bought the warranty ) , but the idea of having such a great stroller is why i decided to take the chance . pros for the stroller : very light , compact and easy to fold ; easy to maneuver ; great for tall people like me -- do n't have to hunch over to reach the handles . there are some nice little things too , like ventilation for the back , a headrest , a cup-holder , and a reclining position . cons are : only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat ( did n't know this when i purchased it ) -- i have a 35 lb . 2 y.o . and a newborn , so we do n't exceed the limit there , but my 42 lb . 3 1/2 y.o . ca n't use it . the canopy does n't cover kids well from the shade ( only the face -- and that 's a big deal when living in southern az -- or if it 's raining ) -- and when the seat is reclined ( for my newborn ) the canopy does n't even cover her head ( i have to clip on a blanket and drape it over ) . my 2-y.o . practically is too big for it -- her head extends above the top of the seat . and finally , the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy . overall , this could be a great stroller , but it 's just not sturdy -- obviously not , it broke -- but one would expect that with a brand name `` jeep '' it would be built better . we only use it for walks and going out , no off-trail stuff -- we used it about 10 times before it broke . my umbrella stroller i bought 6 years ago is still going strong -- why ca n't they make this just as well-built ? i would love this stroller if it were just built better
0	i did not like this hammock . it cuts across your neck and i do not feel like my son is securely in there . i always have to have at least one hand holding him . the front carriers are the way to go since they leave your hands free to do things
1	there are a few things that i liked about my simple round about better . such as , the latch system is more difficult in the decathalon . overall though , very impressive car seat safety system . the fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish . i always feel safe when my little ones are in a britax . well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money . you can not put a price on the safety of your child
1	i did a lot of online and store researching before i bought this seat for my 3 1/2 year old son . my one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children . well now i can say it works well for slim ones as well . he loves the arm rests and the cup holder . it is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary . we liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition
1	it 's perfect for people without a lot of extra room . it 's very sturdy
0	a friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful , but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said , it dies after about 2 months , and the battery is non-replacable . my daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and i ca n't stand it ! if you buy it , do n't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down
0	i washed the cover for the first time and it did n't hold up . the ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band attaches to the terry . also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else i washed with it . i 'm extremely disappointed with this product
1	this a wonderful stroller . i have a large 35lb , 2yr old and he is very comfortable . great folding mechanism . folding is easy and i can do it with one hand . nice pockets for storage
1	i too was given this pump by a lactation nurse , i pump at night after my baby goes to sleep . i think the pump is great ! it does what i need it to do and it very comfortable . the only drawback is that is is kind of loud . i would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally .
0	i researched many car seats and settled on this one . safe and cute ! but it has a *major* flaw : the strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat . my daughter , only five months old , was already almost sitting *on* the belt where it comes out . this mean that the buckle was way too low and tight , forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone . i asked around online on some forums , and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons . many mothers did n't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs , but it was a problem for me already , because we use cloth diapers , so my baby 's butt is bigger due to the 'padding . ' this car seat would n't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers ... and even otherwise , i ca n't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so ... the britax roundabout has the croth belt at a different location , a few inches further out from the back of the seat , so it is the one i am getting as a replacement
0	i love the idea of this product . like many of the other reviewer 's i do n't have the regular traditional style crib . our crib converts to a toddler bed . this product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs . i would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one 's that are more with the current styles of cribs , like mine 's .
0	i received this highchair as a hand-me-down . looks lovely , mine is pale blue and lime green , but is infuriating to clean . i have never seen more cracks , crevices , screw holes , all where baby food and slobber collect . after one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy . you will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices . a friend of mine has a fisher-price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean . the price is insane ( glad mine was free ) . i would never buy this chair even as a gift . i would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean . i would give it zero stars if i could
1	i have a independent child . she will not let you help her do anything so when we got the the potty training stage she had to sit on the potty like mommy . she refused to use those little potty chairs also she did not want to be lifted up and she was still to short to get up on her own by a step stool . when i found this product she was estatic . she started the day we got it and fully trained herself by the end of the week . i agree the product if a bit flimsy and could use another go at it . all in all i do not think my daughter was in any danger using this product though . before you buy it though make sure you have a round toilet and not an oblong or else yes it will slide around . the manufacture told me this over the phone when i called them about the issues i had read . they said it is not made for every family and i agree you have to try something to see if it will work . unfortunatly ever child is different and has a mind of there own
0	i will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference but ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works ... we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall , charging for days at a time , and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck . i had ignored a review i read similar to the one i 'm writing just before i purchased this imonitor , i learned my lesson ! purchase with caution .
0	what to do if you just bought this product : go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house -- -maybe that will knock some sense into you after you 've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk ! ! ! as many reviewers have noted , it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly . first off , the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- why did they choose to use teeny-tiny white lettering ? stupid ! it is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials . in fact the difference between say , level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water ! trying doing that out of a standard faucet . in fact we use a filtered water faucet ( with a thin spout ) and it is still hard to get write . but that 's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio ! we are currently using a 4oz playtex bottle ( with the disposable bags ) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use . level 3 -- - still to cold , but wait , last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula ! and just try to use a vented-type bottle ... forget it ! how about an 8oz . bottle ? no way ! either way to cold or way to hot . and even though we use filtered water , this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar ( as recommended ) evey week or so . however , the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more . why ? because we know that 4oz . of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave ... every time
1	we love this glider as does our 6 week old ! she has reflux so this has been a life saver ! she sleeps in it and enjoys the gentle gliding back and forth as she falls alsleep . we swaddle her and tuck her , turn on the side to side glide and set her womb bear on the edge of the glider ... .off to slumber land she goes ... we highly recommend this
0	now that i have this chair , i 'm not going to replace it but i have two major complaints about it . our son is 20 months old and i still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table . raising the height does n't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you ca n't scoot the chair in any closer to a table . the chair also has a very large footprint -- unless you have a very spacious dining area it 's hard maneuvering around it . if i could do it over again , i would n't buy this high chair
0	unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same premium heavyweight cloth diapers that used to come from gerber . when i called the company ( i use these cloth diapers in my business ) to ask , they told me this was the same product . it is not . they quilt and wrinkle after one washing , and just do n't hold up their shape in general . amazon needs to update their site , because the packaging has changed as well . i miss the old diapers !
0	my son received a bumbo seat for christmas . at five months of age , he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat . at six months of age , he turned in the seat and fell on to his head on two different occassions . the seat was on a flat surface . he did this and i was standing or sitting right next to him . i loved this seat when he first got it . i told everyone i knew about it . he has two older siblings and he loved to be able to watch them play . his siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level . now , i have absolutely no confidence in the safety of this seat . it is completely useless as his `` own body weight '' does not `` keep baby in place '' as advertised . the seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is not safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor .
0	i 've heard some say this is the best warmer available . if so , parents are s.o.l . heating is so inconsistent . same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time . sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot . when the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium . be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place . otherwise , the bottles ( esp . brown 's ) will overflow . if that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate . the carrier is too short for mr. brown 8oz . bottles or any other of similar height . the tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke . the caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open . of course , you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water . they tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.i just ca n't believe that someone ca n't design a better `` mouse trap '' . to add insult to injury , the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off ... ( picture provided by amazon is not the current model . refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers
1	this seems like a really sturdy , lightweight stroller . i just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly -- we live in a very hilly , sort of rustic area , so i needed something i could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy . this is really light , and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit . ( there is also a storage bag for travel . ) the tires have treads on them , so they can handle steep terrain , and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps . the fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester -- not removable , but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary . the seat also has some padding and back support ( although , on the con side , it 's probably not the coolest compared to mesh ) . the weight limit is given as 37 lbs , so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow -- his shoulders are comfortable and his feet do n't reach the footrest yet ( he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall ) . on the plus side , it seems bigger than the wrangler all-weather umbrella stroller , plus it reclines a bit ( you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold ) , unlike the volo . the square canopy is maybe not the greatest ( it only covers the face , and could actually sit a little higher i think ) -- but as for everyone complaining that it falls off , i have found that when you flip the canopy to the back , if you then detach the back flap from the seat , you can attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off . some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels , but i 'm 5'6 '' and have n't had any problems -- i think it 's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it 's an umbrella stroller and does n't have a superwide wheelbase . i would give it 4.5 stars i think , but am giving 5 because of the great price ! i 'm pretty happy with this -- and my son is constantly trying to climb in , so he must like it too ... i figure that with the money we saved , we can buy a nice kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into .
0	i bought this product for my 3yr . old . at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times . at first she did n't want to sit on it again & amp ; she cried when i took her to the bathroom , but i told her i would sit her on it & amp ; i would lift her off . since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched , but it took me a while for her to trust me . if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched
0	we should have been much more careful and read other customers ' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them ( eventually cancelled one ) . we would not recommend this item . after only one wash ( despite having followed the laundry instruction ) , it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib . when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress , they tore..
0	we used these bottles for three weeks , and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to . there are some additional drawbacks as well . 1 ) these leak in travel . twice we 've gone to the park with 7oz , and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag . 2 ) we see no difference in reducing gas . and while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on , what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters ? is this a gimmic ? 3 ) the flow is too fast . we went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these , which are far too fast for an infant
0	i picked this up at my babies r us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror , i would be able to keep an eye on her . from the minute i brought it home , it smelled awful , like artificial grapes . i have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks . at this point i am just going to throw it out because i ca n't imagine having that smell in my car ! ( i have since been back to babies r us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad , and they do . ) do n't buy it without smelling it
1	well made and well priced . your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it ... more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart . buy buy bu
0	the seat is fun to play with , but that is also the problem . my son was so distracted with the features and songs he never sat still long enough to go to the bathroom
1	this high chair is so easy to put together and use . my grand-daughter loves this chair , the music and toys on top occupy her . i like how it changes height and reclines . my grand-daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months . the recline position came in handy ! i would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family
0	i don not like these washes at all . the scent is very very overpowering ! ! ! ! ! i had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong . i do love the case though . it is sturdy and has lots of room
0	i tried fisher-price 's take-along jungle swing then this open travel swing . in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat . the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it did n't stay closed well and the `` palm tree '' was always in the way . finally i bought the fisher-price aquarium swing . i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place ( so it wo n't fold over on baby ) and it is easier to assemble and haul around .
0	we bought this thinking our son would love the neaty gadgets and sounds ... we had several major issues with it . 1 ) the pee guard . it does n't really latch on and stay on . our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room . as luck would have it , when i would go retrieve the item , he would pee and since there was no guard , the pee would go everywhere but in the seat/ pot . to resolve this i had to use special adhesive for plastics ( super glue did n't work at all ) which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training . it also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not . but i had no choice- the guard had to stay on . 2 ) the sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing . he could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went . 3 ) the sounds and gadgets were too distracting . he wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me/ the floor/ whatever was nearby . i finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken . 4 ) when he was ready to use the actual potty , we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats . everytime he pees i have to hold down his `` bits '' because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat , thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants/ underware/ etc . the pee guard is useless for this feature . sometimes even when i do hold his stuff down , if he wiggles or moves , then he is not in position ... there is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes . it was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store . we thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son 's potty training experience . the price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us . finally , i threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets . it was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best . if we have another child , i am going to get the basic toilet seat/ no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter . both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating . do n't waste your money
0	i have no idea why these itch , but i have tried on multiple occasions to wear these pads and found myself wanting to claw my skin when they are in use ! i have n't had that problem with any other brand and will not buy these again . i 'm not continuing to wear the ones left in the box i have , but they make fine sponges for mopping up small spills
0	for all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age , it actually had potential even in the very beginning . our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed , leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake . we tried tightening it to her as much as possible , and she still scooted down it . after a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether . maybe our baby was just too squiggly , but honestly i just found it dangerous . i think it is a great idea , but the product needs some work .
0	we have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough . the double has the same issues ; it 's not sturdy enough for even a modest wind
1	this graco family tree play yard is perfect for newborns . the setup is n't quite as easy as the description implies , simply because the instructions are all pictures , without corresponding written directions . that said , a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward . the quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go . i find this especially convenient because it guarantees that i wo n't leave an essential piece at home when i take the yard with me . the description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music . an attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration , music/noise , and lighting . there are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep . the music is not , however , directly attached to the mobile . also , the mobile sits on its own ; it does not turn . that bothered me at first , but i quickly got over it when i realized my newborn did n't seem to care anyway . the changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that i 've seen , making diaper changes much easier on the back . the built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes . the changing table is padded and easy to clean up , though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort , as there is n't a removable pad on it . this is actually to my preference , as it 's less stuff for my baby to have to contend with , but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning . when taking this on the go , as i said , it 's easy to pack up . one minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard . it does n't have a handle , and it does n't fit all the components of the yard . the changing table and the mobile sit at home when i take this on the go . the reality is , if i 'm travelling , it 's more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about . however , i 'm not sure how i 'll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself . i consider that a very minor consideration though . this play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that i 'm not having to constantly run to the nursery . i 'm not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for ( they look like little soft-sided cup holders ) , but i 've found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths , a pacifier , and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else .
0	i have 2 wipes warmers - one for upstairs and one for downstairs . at one point , i had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work - mine took forever to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section ; same as previous reviews , the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly . i have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine . do not waste your money on the munchkin warmer
0	we bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first . i realized i did n't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down , but could live with it . the second weekend we used it , my 2 year old and his cousin , also 2 , were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far , and the side popped out of position , never to go back in . as far as i am concerned , this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer . there should be some way to fix it when it pops out . definitely would not reccommend it . to make matters worse , babies r us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept
0	i had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend . after just a few uses , the steamer stopped working . when the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed , it just would n't turn on any more . i contacted the first years manufacturer , and to say the least , they did have excellent customer service . they had no problem replacing the unit . upon receiving the second unit , i used the steamer once . and because the steamer could n't hold every thing on the first run i had to run it twice in a row . to my disappointment , i pressed the lever and again it did not work . frustratingly , i pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on . unless you cool it for about a half hour or more , this is how my unit operated . i 'm sure that not every one 's experience is the same but this was how mine was . i definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that i have used .
1	this has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born , and the results will effect them for their whole life ! it felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day , and near the end of my pregnancy i was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly , but i am so glad i pushed through . my daughter is amazing ! i am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement . baby plus did everything it promised and more ! here are some examples : at birth : eyes wide open , hands open , instant excellent nurser , slept 4-6 hours at night , very calm and happy , cried only when hungry . at 1 month : smiling all the time at everyone , sleeping 8-10 hrs . at night. , recognized mom and dad 's faces . at 2 months : laughing , holding head up at 3 months : pressing buttons on toys for 6mos + , rolling both directions , holding own bottle at 4 months : sitting with support at 5 months : sitting without support , drinking from sippy cup , singing , saying first words at 6 months : puts self to sleep , pulled self to standing position , creeping ... and now almost crawling . i am completely amazed at her advancements . people mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is , and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known . i am totally sold on baby plus
1	we love this item . i was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink . this item solved the problem . highly recommended
0	before purchasing this item , please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats . i purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after i received it i was told by the director of safety services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats . i also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well . instead , i returned it and purchased a kiddopotamus , which is shearling-lined and zips but fits over the carseat . the bundle-me item is perfect for strollers , but not for use with a carseat . while i want to keep my baby warm , i think it is much more important that she be safe and secure in her seat
0	i really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in , however the quality of the material is less than desirable . the cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier . i expected some shrinkage , but it seems excessive . i still use the covers but am disappointed overall . the material is not very soft so admittedly i will look around for other products
1	i bought this for my twin girls and i love it . i had them in september and they fit it in all winter . it was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming . using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle . once you 're in the car and warm enough , all you have to do is unzip the sides and there 's no fuss
1	great product . son enjoys being in the chair . he especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray . only thing i do n't like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion
1	i purchased the medela double select pump in anticipation for the arrival of my second child per the recommendation of a relative who had great success with this model ( we both had a terrible time with manual pumps in the past ) . i am extremely pleased with this pump . i can easily fill two bottles within a few minutes and have never had any trouble with the suction , motor , malfunctioning equipment , etc . it is extremely easy to put together and take apart , as well as easy to clean . you will have to buy a pack of medela bottles before the first use as they are not included . and yes , the motor is a little noisy , but not unbearably so . it has neither disrupted my children 's sleep , for example , nor become irritating for me . it is also versatile enough to pump on both sides simultaneously or just on one side . additionally , the medela company has a very solid reputation and i understand that their customer service is very good when it comes to problems with their products . i think that this pump is a wise choice for part-time use ( not more than once or twice a day , at that ) . i 've had much success and i think that most of you will too
0	but after ordering it twice from amazon , and having both arrive either defective or damaged , i give up on this stroller . first one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly . so we returned it to amazon and were sent a new one . it arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway ... put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it . veered to the right , and after close inspection , once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up , probably during shipping . also my 2 1/2 year old 's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is very heavy and hard to turn . ( yes i knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn , etc . ) too bad , i really wanted to like this stroller , but i just do n't have much faith in the company anymore
1	kissaluvs are the best ! they keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable . baby 's skin does n't get red like it does with disposable diapers . also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops .
0	i got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray . trying to outsmart him , i purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl . much to my disappointment , they only stick to the formica countertops well . the littlest one does n't even stick to that . none of them stays on my son 's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two . on the upside , the lids are secure once shut all the way ( which can take a little work ) , so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag ... i have n't had one leak yet , and i put things like applesauce in them to test them . not a total waste of money , now that i found this alternate use . they wash well , without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic , on the top rack of the dishwasher
1	the first night we had our daughter home , she would wake up about every 45 minutes . my wife and i were pulling shifts to take care of her . finally , at 6am , my wife says , `` hey , lets try the secure sleeper that we bought '' . we have n't removed it from her bassinet since . the product does as it says and we swear by it . she is only 2 1/2 weeks old now and sleeps about 5-6 hrs a night . the velcro `` rolls '' can adjust to the babies size . the previous statement about baby falling off may be because the baby is too large . given the size of the secure sleeper , it 's not hard to believe that it will not last once the baby is larger than the sleeper . overall , a great product !
1	we purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping . she always woke up congested and strangled . since we started using the wedge she has n't had any problems at all she is 5 months old now
0	i used this tub for my first born . this is small and holds very little water , therefore , the water gets cold fast ! also , there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves . it can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as i did . our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it 's so small ... when i used larger tub , that did n't happen . one positive thing that i can say about this product is that it 's compact ... i kept it at my mother 's house and it did n't take up much space . i would recommend spending an extra $ 10 to $ 15 and buy a higher quality tub .
0	i thought that these would be great , but could never get them to work right . sometimes they would flow sometimes not . i would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over . to many pieces , to much trouble , i would be upset and my baby would be also ! switched to avent and loving it
1	for all new and expecting mothers , it 's good to get a little help
0	i wish i had put storage bags on my registry instead . they work okay as a multipurpose container , but my freezer is full of these things . moreover , i got the 8 oz ones , so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now . one of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately . plus , you need an adapter to fit the pump..something i didnt know i needed and did n't get . another waste of money from avent .
1	what a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter . when my son wants me to play a game , puzzle or play on the floor . i just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time . i have also found it helpful when i fold laundry . i can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what i am doing . it props the baby 's head up just enough -- better than just laying flat on the floor . the lounger also cradles the baby . i wish that i had found this when my son was a baby . i recomend this lounger to every new mommy .
1	i bought elmo underwear from ebay with a sports theme , and was done training in a couple of weeks . the real underwear incentive did the trick . so , then , i bought more underwear as a reward . i got wiggles , thomas the tank , and nemo underwear from ebay
1	was a snap to put together , very soft for baby , moves with ease , takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller . but that 's the only problem .
0	i bought this seat for my fifth child . she loved it at first , but then about the second week we had it , the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as i was putting her in it . luckily i had not let go of her yet , because the whole thing fell apart on the floor . the rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks . upon investigation , the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover `` material failure '' . i will not buy anything else from this company . not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous
0	i bought this stroller from my daughter , thinking we could transition into it around 6 months . she hated it . the stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat . she would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller . after several months of use , the wheel fell off . also , the stroller is hard to stear . you need both arms on the stroller to push . if you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction . even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body , she prefers other strollers . i bought a cheap stroller from wal-mart and have been ten times more satisfied . this stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the aria tandam , which i assume is better . i would not recommend it to another consumer
1	if you are going to get a manual pump , get this one . i got a medela from the hospital and it was sooo slow and killed my hand , but this one is way better . it takes 5-10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the medela , and it does n't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals , and because you use it for less time total . i have never used an electric pump so i ca n't compare it to one of those , but as far as manuals go this one is awesome
0	for our first baby , we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items . this was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work . we were wrong . the tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners . the slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates . bathtime is about bonding , so after a month and a half of fighting , we ended up taking our baths together . my son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways . the tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom , and the one time i put it in the kitchen sink i filled it with water and it buckled . never tried it again . if you want to wash your baby in the sink , get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns . even for 12 dollars i would not buy this tub again . granted it might work for some , but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby i would not recommend this tub .
0	i have tried several types of pads and these are the worst ! they are very small , thick , and do not hold much , causing them to overflow and leak . i 'd recommend the gerber pads
0	this product has been a disappointment . the pillow portion is good in theory only . the baby 's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not ! so the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right ! would n't recommend , good concept , bad design
0	this was the only gate on the market that i could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area . it stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and i kept having to redrill holes i was a bit angry ! ! ! ! i suggest predrilling your holes ! ! ! the hinges also wo n't stay on and the swinging gate does n't line up . you need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you do n't always have 2 hands free ! by the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out
1	i can not go shopping without my floppy seat ! i do n't know what i am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy . i reccommend this to everyone who comments on it , to purchase for themselves or as a gift . i have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on , or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection , but i ca n't remember where ( babycenter.com , $ 60 ? ) . as other reviewers mentioned , i also used mine for the restaurants too , when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats ( not to mention the gunk in the chairs ! ) . buy this product - you wo n't be dissapointed
0	graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over $ 100 for something that appears to be made with less than $ 20 worth of materials . the seat is much too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a 2006 nissan sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer , but much more inconvenient . the documentation , in my opinion is very poor , and i 've installed linux systems from scratch w/ less documentation ... bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people do n't completely understand the instructions . let 's not talk about the styling ... was n't black , red and gray popular in the 80 's or did i miss the come back somewhere ... i hope i can find something better ... i 'm giving this product two stars because it will do the job ... but i expect much more from a product
0	the warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up . so much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping ! had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off . [ ...
1	they 're a little pricey , but they work great . they are easy to clean , dry quickly , and catch almost all the mess my boys make
1	pupsqueak is wonderful . i am a picky mother about toys . i hate toys that are too loud , too commercial , too cheesy , too useless ... i have high standards . but pupsqueak gets my `` picky mom seal of approval '' wholeheartedly . here 's why . i am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies . while it 's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests , it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy . we have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with , and she clearly enjoys some of them , kicking legs , cooing , , waving arms , etc . the pupsqueak , however , took it to a different level . she loves this thing . we showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old , and she immediately reacted . she laughed , she kicked , all the signs . then , she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down . we were so excited , and she 's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since . the real test , however , was our 10-hour drive from louisiana to kentucky for the thanksgiving holidays . but pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors : anytime she would get fussy , i could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly , and she would be happy again . after my arm would get tired , i 'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him , and she would , at not yet 4 months , bat at it herself . pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft , gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies . he is definitely top dog in my book
1	love these . i use them everywhere . i really ca n't imagine not having them , since my son throws down all plates and napkins still .
1	i purchases this basket for a friend . i was very pleased with its usefullness style . it arrived in two days of ordering
1	very efficiently drains about as much milk as i can get with the pump in style advanced for me , and very portable and easy to clean . i use it when i have a little more time or when i do n't expect to pump more than a couple ounces ( between feedings ) . despite medela 's warnings , i would say you could use this to pump daily , aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast ( massage ) , but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old . my husband enjoyed them more at first , but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old , so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier . at 10 months , he still enjoys playing with them . they have lasted through `` both '' children . i would highly recommend these blocks for infants , and so far even into the toddler age , he enjoys playing with them
0	i have three kids , and for the third time , i am utterly dissapointed with avent 's product . with each new child , we bought a fresh supply of bottles , hoping avent had fixed this problem . we really wanted these bottles to work , as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market , and our kids never had any problems with the nipples . however , each time , we ended up having to switch to another brand . the leak is not just a spot here or there . it is often a torrential downpour , leaking out the sides of the white cap . i know many people who have had the same problem . for as expensive as these bottles are , i would think avent would take more pride in their product , fixing such simple things as a leak . do n't waste your money
1	this product is good for your knees , however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping ... other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste
0	my 15-month-old son pulled these off ( and broke one ) within about 5 minutes of installing them . also , he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas . bad design . do n't waste your money
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in , but really , it took up too much counter space . i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary , i found . save your money
0	this is the flimsiest gate ever . to boot it is not cheap . i could n't even use the screws that came with the gate . i had to use nails and duck tape . the instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together . unfortunately when i bought this gate , there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good . so i was a little confused but i needed a swing gate . so needless to say - i wanted to make sure that i put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled . this gate is n't even worth $ 1.0
0	first of all the diapers get stuck in the lid , and then the room starts to smell like baby poop . yes you can use reg bags for it , the only + about it . first day after changing the bag it smells ok but buy the 2nd wow it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable .
0	i ca n't begin to convey the frustration i felt when trying to use the refill . i struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge . the diaper dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item , but at about $ 30-40 a pop , it is the most expensive garbage can outside of ted kozolowski 's apartment . the printed instructions were clear -- it 's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do
0	i just bought the dora folding potty seat today at walmart . it does n't cover the entire toilet seat . it starts at the front of the toilet , and does n't go all the way to the back . the result is that there is no support in the back . my daughter is 3 yrs , 4 months , and this seat is much too weak for her . any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back . i 'm afraid that if we use it , it will soon break and she 'll fall in . she definitely ca n't sit back , or even sit straight up because it sinks so much . i 'm returning it and i 'm going to look for something else
0	well , i just tried the bundle me ( toddler size ) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and i am disappointed because it is definitely already too small . he really ca n't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent , which he hates . plus , when i have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller ( the only way i can get him in at all ) , then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly . i 'll keep the bag for baby # 2 , but i 'm really disappointed i ca n't use it with my not quite 2-year old .
0	i 've used the diaper dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and i loved it to begin with . very easy one-hand use -- step on the pedal , drop the diaper through the flap , very easy to tie off a bag when it became full . in the beginning , it handled odors well too ; even smelly diapers did n't cause problems . but as soon as i started feeding solid foods , things changed . it proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers . my daughter 's room is at the top of our stairs , and the stench did n't just fill the room , it flowed out her door and down the stairwell , so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs . i took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house . that lasted a week -- i just bought a new pail ( a diaper genie 2 ) and i hope that works better
0	i do n't know who jj cole made this hat for , my daughter had the tiniest head and it still did n't fit . waste of money
0	the problems i had with this gate : 1 . the instructions for using the template to install the hinges , for the fixed gate , was not easy to understand . i finally gave up and i improvised . doing so , the installation went more smoothly . 2 . the gate is not sturdy . if anyone were to bump into it , i 'm pretty sure it would break . 3 . the mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be . fortunately , the people who will using it , have a strong enough grip to get it to work . despite these flaws , however , this gate does serve its purpose , in my case . i bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room -- - which it does . they do n't go near the gate , so fortunately , i do n't have to worry about them leaning on , or jumping on , it . as for the locking mechanism , it 's annoying , and i 'm just hoping it does n't get any worse . this gate would not be safe for kids
1	i bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen , too small for a full-size high chair . the seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months . i do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but i have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting . the cloth lining is very easy to remove , wash , and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean . the tray is easy to put on , remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink . i have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when i need the chair for entertaining others . my daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and , now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster , enjoys having her own place at the table . i highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort .
1	the review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so i decided to buy it and let me tell you , it was the best choice ever . i have no real experience with any other wipes , but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color ... that does not happen with this one . i love that i just put the whole pack in , plastic and all , and it stays nice and toasty for my son 's bottom . he loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore . i love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top . i love that it heats from the top . the wipes never turn yellow and is always moist . i also love the little handle on the top , so i just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be ! the product is hight recommended
0	once we took this net out of the box i knew it would n't work . our balcony railing was not only longer , but shorter in height , than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing . the `` strings '' used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous . i am searching for an alternative
1	we were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the britax marathon carseat on display had a gogo babyz travelmate attached to it . it was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun . two large , solid , screw-in knobs attach the travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat . the whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use . we bought both the marathon and travelmate . we were looking for a better alternative to the sit 'n stroll . this may be it . i can not compare the two options as i have never tried the sit 'n stroll , only read the so-so reviews .
0	these slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing ! i bought two of these ; one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside . i constantly have to cut the strings : - (
1	my husband is a nyc doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son 's room in this theme . since my hubby deals with taxi 's and limo 's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it . we also love manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in l.i . the set is very well made and i like the fact that since it feels like it will last , my son can grown with it . it is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years
1	i bought this portable tent for my graco pack n play because my toddler can climb out of it and i wanted him to be safe . we use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100 % peace of mind knowing that he wo n't be able to escape and injure himself . it is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely . my only negative comment is that it 's a little difficult to put together- i usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity .
0	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all . we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow . i returned it
1	i have this monitor now and i 'm thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby 's voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati
0	my seat is brand new and i love it , but it has already quick working . i 've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly . it wo n't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes . very disappointed .
1	i am nursing our 2 wk old , and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us . my husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby , so , he does not sleep well . the snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep . also , the dvd has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself , because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help . i only wish we would have bought this with second child
0	even though i think this is a very good idea ( no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty ) , the ring does n't fit our toilet seats well . we have the oblong seats , not the round ones , and the ring slides back and forth , especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it . it does n't make her feel very stable so , so far at least , she has refused to use it
1	my son loves these blocks . we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set . he loves saying the colors , numbers and stacking them
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet , it seems that first years has discontinued the product . at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website . we searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer . apparently , they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued . furthermore , the site is full of broken image links . the thermometer works well but without probe covers , it 's not a good investment . you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers . if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there , find another product with covers available
1	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum ... and fast ! we usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so . it also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams . it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison , but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much , which makes that argument mute
0	i bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great . i was so sick of seeing fish , butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes ! but i 've been so disappointed in this chair 's function . with all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps , it 's impossible to keep clean . the straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that i threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to . the worst part of the seat is the tray . it 's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher and my kitchen sink ! ( and both are full sized . ) the way my toddler smears food on the tray , there 's no way i could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it . washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer . oh well , at least they get clean too ... also , i agree with other reviewers that it 's really difficult to slide the tray into place . i wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like i 'm torturing him . on the bright side , the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up . overall , if i had it to do over again i 'd pick a simple fisher price..
1	i 've been co-bedding with my 5 month old son since he 's been with us , but we recently decided to move to a co-sleeper to give my husband and i a bit more space . i have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer . we 've run into a few problems : first we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it 's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we 've had to switch bed frames for now . second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since i 'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing i did n't want to have to reach in and pick him up . we solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses . now he has a softer surface to snooze on and i can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him ... we 'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he 's a bit bigger so he does n't fall out , but for now it works ! hope this helps ! *** i 'm adding this a few months after use- i like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed , but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times ... still prefer to have him in the bed with us !
0	i love this swing because it goes side to side , she can sit when awake , lay down when asleep , and once you put her in she is out cold . after 6 weeks of using it i thought the battery was going , but when i changed the battery the music was still slow and i still had to keep the swinging motion on high , two weeks later it just stopped working . i 've only had it for two months and hardly use it , just a total of 3 hours a day give or take a few
0	i 'm currently in the process of adopting my son , and i bought this to take to guatemala with me when i visited . it never worked - it did n't matter how much water i put in the chamber , it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds . i then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle . i ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water , and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up . needless to say , it 's been sent back . i think i 'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it 's got to be easier and quicker than this thing
1	these are really good bottles . i have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son . my only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns . the flow is much too slow . my little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried . so if you plan on using these bottles , i would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby . i am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples . other than that , these bottles are great
0	does n't dry your bottles at all . it leave a condensation and does n't dry completely . i give it one star for all the stuff it holds , but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it .
1	we got this chair as a baby shower gift , which i registered for and absolutely love it ! i do n't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about . if used properly , this chair gives absolutely no problems . the seat locks in at different levels , if it 's not locked in , of course it will fall apart . the seat is easy to use , folds easily , and cleans easily . we store it in our van ( we have stow-and-go storage ) and it fits perfectly ! we 've used it since my son , now 16 months , could sit up . he lays his body from side to side and the seat does n't budge ... very safe . the tray does snap off easily , and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it . this does n't bother me , since it 's not a 'toy ' and should n't be climbed on anyway . the tray has n't snapped off while in use , and hopefully wo n't ! we 've used this chair on both a chair , and the floor when seating was limited ( like at family get togethers ) . we have n't had any problems at all . anyway , i highly recommend it..
1	my daughter recently had her second child , and spends alot of time breastfeeding . this product allows her to pump at her convenience . she can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child . the product works very well . she said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her , but it is an excellent product . she previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer , and heard how good the medela brand was from a friend . this brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive , noisier pump she had before . we would highly recommend this product , and the product is well worth the price paid
1	i 'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl . i had intended to only breastfeed for the first year , but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on . so much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week . the pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up . i chose the premium nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding . my daughter took well to the bottles , and even started latching on better when i did breast feed . i 'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever . when people ask me if i breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby , i say `` both '' , and they tell me how lucky i am ! these bottles are a life-saver ! they 're easy to clean ( i use the top rack of the dishwasher ) , and my baby has n't had any problems with colic . i like the convenience of the disposable bags , too . and my daughter is now starting to `` help '' hold on to the bottle while i feed her . these are the best
0	i used these pads when i first started nursing . they did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes . however , my nipples were incredibly sore . when i took my baby to her first appt. , the pediatrician suggested cloth pads . what a difference ! yes , they did cause me to leak through a little , but that was needed . when all the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms . do n't use these . buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath ( i use the imse vimse )
0	i was so excited to buy this stroller . it seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter . the mesh back would be ideal for the hot , humid weather . it 's light and easy to travel with . it seemed sturdy . most of this was true until i used it for a month . honestly , the seat is way too big ! my daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep . with minimal padding ( and no recline ) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around . and to top it off , the frame bent after basic use . all we did was take it in and out of the car ! i was very disappointed . maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old , but do n't buy this stroller b/c you 're looking for something smaller than your graco ( but better than an umbrella stroller ) for your young toddler . i think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality . every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that 's the only extra feature ! this stroller was not for us !
1	having only used it once , as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat , it worked wonderful . having a clean place to put her food on was nice , as you never know just how clean the tables really are
1	well , i 'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product , but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on . he 's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed , but orthopedic giant dog beds started at over $ 200 . we got the idea to try a baby crib mattress , and ordered it . very soon thereafter i arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat ; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable . he loves it . it is well crafted and everything the ad said . our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog
0	we bought this product so that i could see my 6 month old son from the front seat . but everytime i put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face . the blinds do n't stay up either . their suctions do n't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door .
1	i registered for this item as one of those `` i would n't buy it but it 's a nice thing to have '' . i did receive it and am so glad i did . my son loves this ! ! he gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger . i would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if i needed them
0	i used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made , then i got a new bag ( customer service was very nice and helpful ) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it ( my stroller was n't damaged ) , so i have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money , still waiting on a refund
1	this pillow has become my preganant wife 's best freind . she snuggles with this pillow way more than she snuggles with me
0	i had purchased the dr. brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness . they did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most . by this point , both babies had become attached to these bottles and would n't use anything else . at first i thought i must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak , and sometimes pour out of the rim of the bottle . ( i have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles , none this bad ! ) we tried everthing to stop the leaks - *using only all dry parts for each new bottle *not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside *not overfilling after an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles i noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple , that milk would come pouring down the sides ! finally , the answer to the leaks ! ! ! is truly a great idea and i hope they try to perfect it , but these have a major design flaw - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun . these items were meant for baby use , and for the price it should help make babies ' mom 's life easier . stick with avent or playtex with liners . thank you good luck
0	i purchased this bed online last year . it looks great and as we all know our daughters love dora . however , the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy , you would problably give up . the rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes , and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months . & lt ; br / & gt ; what a waste of money , invest a bed that your child can growth with , and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child
1	these are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night . they wash up nicely and seem as good as the day i bought them . my only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro . they stick to other things in the wash . i think this puts extra wear on the velcro too
0	i purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better . i was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe , wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly . unfortunately i do n't have the original box therefore can not return the item . i am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from one step ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box . through friends i have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that i wo n't be disappointed . hopefully babiesrus will sell this other item in the future
1	i bought this as a gift - ca n't give much opinion - she told me she loved them , so i give it 5 stars . maybe that 's not a fair review , but it 's breast pads . they are always useful ! lo
1	i was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews , but i did it anyway , and i 'm glad . the covers are durable -- the color has n't faded , and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad . i think they 're soft enough for diaper changing -- i would n't put my baby to sleep on it , but then , who would
1	the pacified pod isn 's `` essential '' , but it 's definitely good to have . you can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom 's bag , or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk . and with all the cute patterns , you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag
0	we have this stroller and are n't really thrilled with it . in fact , we 're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it . our children are aged 2 years and 4 months . while the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier , this stroller worked well for him . he 's now out grown the carrier , and we 've put him in the seat of the stroller . the shoulder straps are too tight for him and do n't adjust well . the seat is n't padded well and there is no head support . our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller . with the infant in the front , we have to keep it reclined , so my daughter has to lean forward if she 's sitting in the back . she hates standing on it because she is very short and she ca n't see anything . she would much prefer to sit in the front . we find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless . we ca n't reach it so we never use it . there is no cup holder or tray for the parents . it is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy . so , i think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now
0	this is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid . it 's easy enough to install but hello ! what 's to stop anybody , especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together ? not a thing ! the `` kit '' that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it 's closed , it does n't fit snuggly around the seat so it 's completely loose . total and complete piece of junk ! !
1	this diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use . * it 's functional and has multiple organizers , including a place for your cell phone , keys , and a zippered insulated compartment for baby 's bottle or a toddler 's drink . * for parents , there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items . the interior has easy stash pockets for storing diapers , wipes , and other baby essentials . * overall , it 's a stylish looking bag that moms or dads could use . the design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated . * after nearly two years of daily use , it 's still in good condition and shows little signs of wear . * it 's also a very convenient on-the-go type bag that stays put when you 're out and about
0	this diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags , both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail before the reality of dirty diapers . even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with lysol between uses , it still smelled bad every time we opened it . sometimes the smell seeped out , so it made the whole bedroom stink . and my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and , of course , adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail . the twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea . it helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail ... but you can not let the pail get even close to full , or it wont twist . and after two years of use , the twisting mechanism does n't work anymore . the latch for the small opening is also broken
0	i had tried this for my newborn and i think this product is unsafe and not sturdy . the base of the seat is very wobbley , it would help to have suction cups on the bottom . and you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm . also , when i put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs , the seat tipped backwards . i can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more . i do not think this product is safe . it would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it . so i returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from safety first that worked well with my first child
1	this is so much better than the bjorn carrier . you can wear it on the hip or in front . it is very comfortable . my baby always felt secure and i never thought he would come out . i could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem . my back and shoulders were never sore . easy to put on . great way to calm a fussy baby ! reversible black for men too
0	it 's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached . effectively serves its purpose , but for nearly 16 bucks ? ! ! puleeeeeeeease
1	i love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it . i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud . i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use . so now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth . if i had to do it all over again - i would still buy this swing b/c of the design . i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
1	this product was very easy to use , quick clean up , and very discrete to carry in public . my husband and i are constantly using it when we are out with our child . i especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage
0	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small . big mistake . it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old . i 'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version .
0	i got two of these as shower gifts . i thought that they would be so handy . wrong ! the velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table . the openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are very small . they will only hold the travel size or the next size up . it was made cheep . the `` shelves '' are not sturdy at all . save your money !
1	our hungry pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years . the bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing . his fat cheeks squeak , his wings crinkle , and his feet rattle . he comes with four sea creatures ( crab , shrimp , fish , and octopus ) that are each different textures and colors , and make different sounds ( rattle , rustle , etc. ) . children can put the little animals into pelican 's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy . the large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again . i found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds , colors , and textures of the four little sea creatures . toddlers progress to the eating game . i am grateful to mr. pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning . what can be better than that !
0	we purchased storkcraft 's rochester stages crib in natural , aspen changing table , 5 drawer dresser , 3 drawer dresser , 2 side units ( left and right ) and a hutch . every single piece of furniture that we 've gotten from storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces . on the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked . it 's obvious that storkcraft has no quality control . we 're in the process of deciding whether or not we 're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit . all i 'm going to say is do n't waste your time on purchasing storkcraft furniture
0	reasons why i do not like this potty : 1 ) the shield falls off with one touch , ussually into the potty ! 2 ) the potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways . 3 ) it is cumbersome to empty the potty . 4 ) once the shield is lost ( since it impossible to keep attached ) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess . i highly recommend that bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield
0	i purchased the peg perego aria stroller last month for my 3rd son . needless to say , i have lots of experience in the stroller world . this was my first peg perego stroller purchase as i have used graco and maclaren in the past . i had been using my maclaren umbrella stroller ( which i purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old ) and thought i would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old . my girlfriend recommended the aria so i purchased it . anyways , it was a huge disappointment . the steering is awful . you definately need two hands for this stroller . the stroller is also extrememly `` wobbly '' . i was shocked as i figured such an `` upscale '' brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much . the 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little `` envelope '' type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place . it is bulky in that it does n't fold into a small compact stroller . i used this 3 times and just gave it away ... what a waste of $ $ . i 'm back to using my maclaren , which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller . i could kick myself for wasting the money . my advice to you is test it out before you buy it ! ! ! ( do n't rely on the name
0	though this potty is nicely priced , it 's worth it to buy a more expensive one . though mine has n't fallen apart like other reviewers , it does shift around on the base , allowing for spillage . the removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat , so my daughter gets stuff all over the inside , not just in the receptacle . the inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern ( see my customer image ) so it 's impossible to clean messes out of it . it does serve it 's purpose as a potty , but i 'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one
0	i bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they would n't leak like the last ones i had used . they do n't leak , but the stage 1 is too slow and frustrates her . she 's 5 months and the stage 2 is too fast . they made a huge mistake in not making more stages . had i realized this before i had used them , i would have taken them all back
1	my mother-in-law bought these for my daughter . at first , i was skeptical about how entertaining they would be , but my daughter took to them right away . in the beginning , she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise , but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures . she also loves to knock them down when i stack them up . they wo n't entertain her for hours , but she 's always thrilled to see them when i break them out for the first time that day
1	unfortunately - the baby i bought this for already had one ! but i got to see it in action , and listen to the parents rave about it ! it is really neat - almsot to the point i wish i had kept it for myself ! !
0	i agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle . especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle . the water in the warmer actually boil when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle , it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle . you end up having a boiled hand as well . the worst part is it will burn your love one ... . not only that , the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler . we switched to avent warmer . a little more $ $ but it is much better . i would not recommend this product
1	other parents told us about these , specifically the vanilla scented ones . baby # 1 was bottle fed and took to an advent pacifier right away . we used the scented soothies whenever we could n't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes . not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent , but she always calmed down wihle we 'd finish getting the bottle ready . baby # 2 was also bottle fed , but did not take to any pacifier right away . we tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the advent ones too . she eventually took to the advent . it really is up to each baby what they will like . but these are definately worth trying . in addition to the regular and vanilla ones , there are also various sizes , including preemie , pacifiers attached to small stuffed , plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth ... and also easier for mom dad to in the back of the car , the darkened bedroom , etc
1	this jogger is great - i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it - no complaints , in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w/ mo
1	this crib has been a smash hit with our baby girl . not too big yet roomy enough to spread out . she loves sleeping in her crib , and we like the size and convenience . not sorry for the purchase ! carl
0	after three weeks my brush broke too ! can not find a replacement , i do not want to buy a whole new rack . design fault that they should correct . not good enoug
0	we love this monitor , but only when it does not have awful interference . unfortunately , in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours . we do not live in an apartment or townhouse ( which i read was not recommended for this product ) , but we do have wireless internet . only we are n't using it when there is static , so who knows ... i love being able to see my boy , but the static makes the monitor really annoying
1	my daughter ordered this to go with the crib shield system . it 's a nice addition to the system and looks very nice
1	my baby is now 5 months old , and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night . this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
1	i cringe at the idea that i fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles . i might not be able to breastfeed my baby , but with my new glass bottles , at least i know that i am feeding her the purest form of formula i can possibly give . she hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so i bought some silicone ones and was successful . when i consider the epidemic of autism in this country , i am dedicated to buying pure , organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave .
0	i bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story . luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted . i bought it because it was lightweight , had a front tray , adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color . i was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk . well , after a couple weeks , i changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my graco for longer trips . here are the negatives i experienced with the peg prego aria : - poor steering . can not handle quick turns . - sun shade only works for direct overhead sun . - 5 point harness is poorly designed . the plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled . - my drink holder broke . - overpriced for features and quality . my positives are : - nice looking - easy to fold - lightweight i keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company . thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room ! i would not buy a peg prego again
0	if you research the toxic gas theory for crib death ( which has been around for 15 ? years ) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can . this product is not safe at all , no matter what they call it . get a babesafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby , and use only 100 % cotton on top of that ( between your baby and the mattress cover ) . do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100 % cotton blankets . run from this product
0	i 'm a big believer in reading amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray ! but this chair ( which we bought specifically because of everyone 's praise ) is miserable ! i do n't understand why it got such high marks ... the tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it ( rather than the chair ) has a `` leg separator , '' which means you ca n't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place . we 've also found that the tray can be extremely difficult to hook onto the chair , and does n't push in towards the baby 's belly far enough . in addition , the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and ca n't be cleaned well , so they 're beyond gross , just after a few feedings . of all the baby things we wish we 'd never bought , this is number one on the list ... i ca n't help feeling that if we 'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair , we would have done better than this thing ... the only reason it gets one star is because i appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it 's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors . ;
1	overall , we are very happy with this product . i like that it covers the entire side of the crib and does n't come up only partway like a traditional bumper . also , i like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it `` gives '' a bit when baby pushes and kicks it . we have a nonstandard length crib ( babee tenda ) , so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail , but we had read about this issue in another review from a babee tenda crib owner , so we knew up front we would have these gaps . these small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby does n't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location ( i think it 's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so ) . the white satin edge is very pleasant to look at . overall i like this product much more than the traditional bumpers i have seen .
0	i will not buy these again . they are tiny , thick and do not tapper on the edges . this means you will see the lines thru your shirts . the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night . i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela , they cover more , are thinner and stick better .
1	i bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair . it worked great and kept things cleaner . unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck .
1	i purchased your `` space saver highchair '' for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled . finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult . this chair works for everything ! this chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day . she also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and can not get them back in her hand . i love this chair for its size , the way the whole seat tilts ( not just the back ) , and the 5 point harness . the chair is also small so it holds her very nicely . my daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
1	this bib does it all and there are no complaints whatsoever ! i used to go through 8-10 bibs every few days , but now this is the only bib i use every day , all day ! easy to wash , catches everything so there is little mess on or around my child and it 's easy on , easy off !
0	i have looked at alot of other reviews before i bought and wished that i had n't because . you ca n't go off someone else 's experience , you really have to experience it for yourself . first of all it 's too bulky . the suction thing on the tub did n't stick and it was in the way when i tried to shower and kept falling down . my poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub , so i had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom . i bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though i will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her . i was very temped to send it back but i 'm just going to sell it on ebay . i 'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me . i 'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms , maybe mines is defected !
1	now that i 've caved to the power of pink ( it only took three girls for me to finally give in ) , this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest i could find . quality seems fine ( two weeks post purchase ) and who does n't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood ... ? for the first babe , we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat , but had so many functions it was basically useless . this is a case , though , where the basics are the best . in looking around for a new one , saw many for $ 100 ; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic , this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months , anyway
1	i have a home daycare , so this chair is used constantly . i 've had two of these for well over a year , and today i bought a third one . i 've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far . nothing beats the swinging tray . i would recommend it to anyone
1	i have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie-talkie feature . it works well and has a great range . the vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation ; no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep
1	as i am not personally using this , i can only pass on what i have been told . it does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away
0	i gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son 's ( 1 year old ) christmas gift and this was one of the items . boy do i regret giving him this as an idea . it is a cheaply constructed toy . the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly . the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes . my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
0	this stroller is way to heavy , too long , steering is very difficult and too bulky , it is huge when folded . try something else .
0	our daughter loves the mobile , she laughs every time the peek-a-boo leaves open to reveal the animals . unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed , none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds . the sound is also very soft
1	i love this simply designed , sturdy potty . my son loves it which is most important . he has no trouble sitting down on it ; no pinching , no crampedness , no tipping over . the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean . the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product , great price . i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's .
0	i bought the bottles and when i used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we
0	these bottles leak after a few months and it 's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle . you almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak .
0	the only good thing i can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink . it 's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly . otherwise i can not take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward . i will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me ( i 'm a nanny ) i do n't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already . i would think that if something is deemed an `` infant '' ' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up
0	this potty is completely useless . it is so small that my three years olds ' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it . it is unstable on those little plastic legs and it 's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it . this potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless
0	first , i agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby 's sleep better . that i can not deny . our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking . however , the trade off in better sleep is not worth the risk . i woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters . she could have easily suffocated ! this is a very common complaint with this product ( both here on amazon 's web site as well as on target 's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that i had ) . some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product . i have to tell you that that is not quite the case . our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and does n't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated . the bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that does n't explain things either . if you choose to purchase this product , please be very careful with it . i understand that those of you who have infant with reflux do n't really have a choice about this but i recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down . as for us , we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters .
0	my experience has been similar to that of other reviewers . the one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro . my two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when i checked her in the middle of the night . honestly , the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they did n't move their arms ... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own
1	i bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and i love it . he 's 5 months old now and i have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems . i have to pump in the ladies room where i work , but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what i 'm doing . i work 10 hour shifts , so i pump quite a bit , but this pump is so easy to use that i do n't have the hand/wrist pain that i 've had with other manual pumps . overall , the bag is stylish and discreet , the bottles are fabulous ( no nipple confusion problems ) and i have not had any problems with any part of it . the only thing i would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you ca n't keep your milk in the fridge . i had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day . otherwise , i have no complaints . excellent product and service
0	this item is too small . i kept putting it on the back windshield but it kept falling down each time . i could not see my baby in this tiny mirror . not worth the money at all
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child . not only does it give additional padding that was not intended , nor tested with your safety seat , but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that `` after-market products '' should not be used . it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description
0	this would be a great space-saver . . . but now that gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars , we never used it at all ! ! now gerber makes their own feeding center to accommodate their tubs , and i love it
0	we are `` training '' and really were looking for a useful aid . it did n't work for us , allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated . we will continue to use it with our younger child , in hopes of avoiding a diaper `` leak through '' accident .
0	i was really disappointed in this `` sealy ultra '' . it does not feel like a very good mattress . we 'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better . i 'd say you need to see the mattress , decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet
1	it is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on . i found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat . i was delighted when i found the urban me bundle . i do n't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out . we just put on her hat and go . the urban me bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort . it helps too that it is rain resistant . i have received many compliments on my urban me bundle and found it to be a wise investment . it really does n't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out
1	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone . we just love it and so does our 6 month old
0	i was very disappointed with this pump . it was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks , and i only used it once a day . even more disappointing was the companys return policy . you have to ship it to them at your expense , wait for them to send you a new one , and return that one to the store . do not waste your time
0	this is the worst pump you could buy . i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down . it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work . please do n't waste your money ... ... . i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product . if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing . i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product
1	i 'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about -- the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat . it 's easy to install and works great
0	i bought this item in preparation for my first child . i tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time , from 94.2 - 102.3 ! ! i returned it the next day , do n't bother !
0	this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light . if i were to do this over , i would buy a different infant seat
0	the screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately -- - was about to use my own , then read the review below and decided i 'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . .
1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame . i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down . i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was . once he was walking , he did n't use it again
1	when it comes to using this for your children you 'd have to first know what your needs are . i ca n't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing ; it would be more like a psychological barrier . but depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they should n't have . i ordered this to use for my puppy . in my case i do n't have the problem of her pushing on it so i ca n't say how long it would last through that . for this price i was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install .
1	first , i must say that this sling was an absolute lifesaver when my ( somewhat colicky ) son was a newborn . no matter how fretful his mewling , when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling , he would fall asleep . because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks , he spent a good deal of time in it . three aspects of the design are great : 1 . the bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad ; 2 . the sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat ; 3 . it grows with your baby -- my tiny baby hated the front-type bjorn carriers , but loved this and still likes it . one aspect of the design is , to me , dreadful -- the shoulder strap ! it should be wider and padded . i tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what i did , the strap dug into my shoulder . in the end i just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder . good use for a mitten that 's lost it 's mate , but i would rather have a better strap
1	what a great product . it really keeps the baby warm even in the coldest winter . when the wind is whipping , the generous front flap flips up over the carrying arm of the baby seat and also keeps the baby warm . no fussy coats and hundreds of blankets . i hope to use it next winter also
1	we loved the mini co sleeper ! our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy . i loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed . i could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and i didnt even have to roll out of bed . the mini co sleeper was so portable that i never even bought a pack n play . we traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us . i highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high . i will use this for our next baby as well
1	[ ... ] it def . is ... very sturdy , does n't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too : ) i 'm very happy with this chair - the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms ... i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders . i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse ... my son has n't gotten food under there yet ... i ca n't wait to use it as a booster seat :
0	i installed this mirror in our car two days ago . today it was in my daughter 's lap when i went to get her out of the car . the mirror broke off from the base . i bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors ( suction cup attachment , etc ) . i would not recommend this product
1	i just bought these and my daughter looks adorable . the first time i put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them . the shades come with two straps , one small and one large . my daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big . the velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head . in this position , her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it 's not a big deal . if straight around her head , the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes . even if adjusted as small as possible , the large strap is still a little too big . it should fit in another month i think .
1	i have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow . i bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old . and i have been wearing it almost all day long every day since . she is 11 weeks old today . she is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow . the cushion is made of firm foam . she falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist . even when she 's not nursing or napping , the pillow helps me to support her weight when i 'm sitting or standing . it fits me very comfortably even though i 'm plus size . the only drawback is that i need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry , although it is machine washable . i really love this fabric , but apparently , this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover , so i guess i 'll try the oatmeal twill cover .
1	i bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son , and he loves it ( whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs ) . it 's a great size , easy to use , good color for hiding stains , and comfortable for him to sit in . best of all , because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag , we can be sure that he does n't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat ! this is an excellent product , and well worth the money
0	this accessory system does not fit my kohlcraft umbrella stroller . i can find a place to put the parent cupholder , but there is no place at all to put the child 's snack tray . the stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller . the whole purpose of spending the money on this `` system '' ( which was considerably more expensive than others in the store ) was for my child to have a snack tray . therefore , it 's going back to the store . there are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this ... even the prince lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive ... the product itself is also very cheaply made . the `` s '' hooks look so flimsy i would n't trust them ... again , they sell thicker , sturdier `` s '' hooks that look like they will work much better than this , so that 's what i 'll purchase . plus , the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy ... already the `` arms '' have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter ! thirdly , i 'm not sure if it was the `` clips '' that came in my packet ( perhaps a defect ) or if they are all made this way ... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips ... and then they did n't fasten correctly . no matter how i tried ( i worked on it for close to an hour and i consider myself pretty good at these things ! ) , i could not get the clips to tighten properly . they continued to be loose ... even with using the smaller screws . perhaps my stroller tubing is `` too small '' ? ? ? very unlikely , but it just might be the case . this is going back to the store , where i will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $ 5 , a package of two ( thick ) `` s '' hooks for $ 3 and my child will have to learn to `` deal '' with holding her snack cup and straw cup . i will save myself $ 10 , a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly , and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items ! ! ! do yourself a favor and do n't bother with this product ! ! !
1	i 'm really pleased with this crib . the price was right and it arrived within a matter of days . shipping and handling costs were very low . a few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow . otherwise , it looks great and is very sturdy . great crib for the price
1	i got this for my baby due in march . even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy . its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather . it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby . it washes well too ! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you do n't need it then the top part zips off and you do n't have to take baby out and remove the entire product . then the next chilly day zip the top back on ! great all around
1	that 's just it- i love this product , and i am so happy that we purchased it . it saves time and space , and is very safe for my children . we bought 2 , one for each of my children- and they have been wonderful
1	i love this product . i have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early . i swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the nicu and they loved sleeping that way . i stopped swaddling them at 2 months because i could see they no longer liked it . my night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year . she said it would help them sleep through the night . i bought this product and while my girl and boy twins did n't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them . not long after i started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7 . what a dream ! he is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all . i have found that it works better when i put them in it when they are drowsy because then they do n't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep . we do n't use them during the day now . i will always give this as a baby gift going forward
1	this monitor has the best sound quality you can put the radio on the monitor and listen on the recever , it will sound like the radio is next to you . i had the monitor for 2 year with out problems with range or interferance . my monitor is been on and in the same channel all that time . i try three other monitors one of them digital . the sony sound quality is untouchable . very sensitive , i can hear my baby move at night . i had no problems with range ( i work out on the basement during her nap ) . it has the best volume ( i can hear her over a loud treadmill and music ) . i was happy to return the other monitors to get this one . the one problen i found is the monitor and the recever can not be close to each other because it will make a horrible loud noise . to avoid this i turn off the monitor before getting close to the room the baby is sleeping in . the water resistant feature is great , i can put the recever right in the shower and listen or watch the lights . it is not waterproof ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you do n't want to get it wet ! ! ! ! ! ! , but the humidity or a little splashing wo n't hurt it
1	this is the best bed rail if you do not have a box spring . my 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and i purchased this rail because he has a `` bunkie '' board instead of a box spring . the length is satisfactory , and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges . it is easy to make the bed as well . we also purchased it for the grandparent 's house because they have a platform bed . it works equally as well . my only complaint is that maybe the rail is n't high enough but my son has n't been tempted to climb over it . i would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a `` big boy '' bed that does n't have a box spring ( although the manufacturer recommends it )
1	i purchased this despite the reviews i read , out of desperation ! but have been very happy with the fit on my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet . it is a little thin , however , i use a carter 's mattress pad underneath anyway , so i am not concerned with absorbancy . it does the job as a nice surface to lay my son 's head on , and i purchased one more in navy to switch out when it is laundry time
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement . i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt ( i have a small frame and it is big on me ) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done . very friendly , amazing customer service , that 's hard to find these days !
1	i am quite satisfied with this product overall . sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence . during armer weaather when the window was opened i also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very good product
0	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip . i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work . i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work . all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries . waste of money !
1	excellent product ... very difficult to find in stores . can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer ... healthier than heating in plastic
0	i took this on a short trip , it proved useless . it 's unstable , has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby 's bottom -- i ca n't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this ... especially a potty-training child ? my daughter was fairly young when we tried it ( we did some early pt , and she was about 10 months old ) . she 's now 2 , fully pt , but will still not go near it . if it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old , how would it do under the weight of an older child ? beyond me . i still give it 2 stars , because it 's an otherwise neat idea . impractical execution , though
0	we own two of these and they have never been easy to use . we tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat . we have kept it though . we bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off . we would not buy this one again . we do have large carseats - they are both britax marathons
0	i have small hands , so i actually ca n't grip this product with one hand . it slips right out , because there is no hole . the items are okay , really do n't like the nail cutters though , and they do n't stay in there places . i 'm sure there are better kits out there
0	the aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son . the nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails . i use my own revlon clipper especially since i am comfortable with the feel of it already . the thermometer is sooo ... slow , i get make an educated guess faster . the case is cute and i am sure the medicine droppers are ok ... have n't needed those yet . but all in all , i threw half of this kit in the garbage
0	( 2 stars because the style is cool ... ) this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy ( 19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months ) and it was too much to carry him , his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution ... and it was ... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after i received it ! and i was careful , i had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and i had thought they had just over filled the bag ... nope ! the bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side ... you ca n't overfill that ... there 's just room for one bottle , is n't that what it is made for ? ? ? my husband really loved this bag because it was n't 'girly or babyish ' but put the $ $ on something that will hold a bottle !
0	tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed . ihave a product from nano bags that beats this one in construction and comfort . this was nice only received as a gift but nothing more . washed poorly , disappointed
1	this potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces . it is also more stable than others we used . we like it
1	i purchased these for my pack n ' play , and they are soft and durable . a real must-have for pack-n-play owners
0	i bought this pump the day i was discharged from the hospital ( 12/11/05 ) . i have used it on a part time basis since i am staying home and nurse directly . however , the motor broke and could n't pump anymore . my baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke . i have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby . i was lucky to call medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so i could get my money back .
0	i purchased this seat because of the safety factor that consumer reports reported on . in comparing the seat to graco snugride , however , i am very disappointed on the tough , very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat . the foam goes down to a certain point on baby 's low back , and then disappears , leaving a dip for baby 's buttocks . just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region ( with buttocks not supported ) ... not comfortable . i wonder how a baby 's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat ... well , i 'm not going to take any chances . baby trend should have consulted a physical therapist ( like me ) before designing this seat .
1	i picked this monitor after reading many reviews . the reviews did n't lie . this monitor does great on distance . i have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors . the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor . i can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound . i could hear him grunt even ! i do n't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss . you 're given many channels in order to find the right strength . i could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal ( he was on opposite end of house upstairs ) . i also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times , not getting it soaked . also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound ( no radio or tv or mobile playing ) . great product , strongly recommend . my son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great . this monitor is the right choice for the average household . interference may come if you 're on the same channel . i have wifi network , cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just do n't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
0	i bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he could n't turn around and see the world . i hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move . the seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there is n't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable ) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby could n't move around . i did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear . the seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . there is a $ 5 return charge .
0	this lock works good for a little while , then the push mechanism breaks . it may or may not break completely off , so it could still work even when it breaks . i 've gone through two of these already , and they only lasted a few months before they broke
1	i am sure this is a good stroller ( that 's why i bought it ! ) my `` review '' is more of a word of caution : this thing takes forever to arrive . do n't be fooled : `` usually ships within 24 hours '' really means `` may ship sometime '' . as of 2/8/06 , our stroller has not arrived . it was ordered january 1 , 2006 . it is not even slated to ship for another week ( we 'll see ... ) . meanwhile , the local store has several in stock . my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion : go to your local store . otherwise , be prepared to wait a very long time .
1	i did my research for the best stroller , thus this one is the best in market , travelling with my baby is much fun and easier . i can carry , fold and move it with no help , its so easy to open and fold . its very cozy , my baby can sleep happily in it
0	the nail clippers , hairbrush , and comb are great but i did not care for the rest . it would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company
1	my 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs , so right from the very beginning , he 's been in the big tub with a tub seat . he loved bath time until just a few weeks ago , when he outgrew our original especially for baby ( the bru `` house '' brand ) tub seat . in desperation , we searched the shelves at bru and settled on the mother 's touch . i ca n't say enough good things about this tub seat . the head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn 's delicate head , and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows . the two-position back reclines for newborns , and sits up straighter for older babies . the entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub , but i found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water ( in the old tub seat , he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in ) . one of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he could n't sit up in it . the design of the mother 's touch provides enough support to allow baby to sit up mostly unassisted , and the ample padding makes sure he does n't bruise himself on the hard edges . even though there 's lots of support and padding , it 's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this ( or any ) tub seat . another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that i 'd like to respond to : *there are no suction cups on the base : i have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction , but tubs may vary . *she would like a strap : the seat that i have does have a strap ( it 's stored underneath the seat , so may not be immediately identifiable ) , so i wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently . overall , my son and i are very happy with this tub seat , and i 've been recommending it to friends . they 'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down , though . i foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it !
1	we are in italy with these huge , weird shaped stairways . these gates are great and just what we were looking for . easy to install , easy to use once up . they look nice in our house
1	we bought this stroller today in honolulu at the bike factory . our son is 18 months old , 48 pounds and 40 inches tall ( yes , we know we got a linebacker on our hands ) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so . we love that the max weight is 70 pounds , but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there , i think ? ? ! ! . i am going to read the instructions again to see if i might have missed something . but other than that , the stroller is very sturdy , well-made , and light weight . it handles like a dream and i would n't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old graco . it folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our explorer , where the graco did not . i ca n't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning . oh , and our son loves it too by the way ... he watched elmo in the living room and would n't get out until we bribed him with a bath , so it must be pretty comfortable . definitely worth every dime , we love it . i ca n't say enough good things about bob either , they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too , [ ...
0	i agree with rebecca -- bravados are more simple , more flexible , and more comfortable
0	i had been told that these were wonderful , to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back . but my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides . this worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach
0	seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants . so now it sits in my car fading in the sun . save your money
0	this idea is nice but , the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap . next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray , and that is really hard to get off , by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash . unless you are super woman i would not bu
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it . i love the theme , but the mobile was a big disappointment . it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available , he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it . also , although the mobile matches the theme , i found that the colors were n't very stimulating . we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match , our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it .
1	the medela breast pump works with dr. brown 's bottles ( you can pump directly into the bottle ) ! just an added benefit to an already great product . i 've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had no problems . it 's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months
0	we got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock , but lo and behold it only lasted a week . our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib , so when he kicked this , the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off . luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib , where it could have posed a choking hazard ! pass on this and get a fisher price one - ocean wonders or the one we got , flutterbye dreams , which he loves
0	this product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins . we had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless . unless your child 's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators .
0	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes . i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form . but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny . if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one . we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older . we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week . the prima pappa is comfortable and secure . in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles
0	loved the car seat , until my daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps . i would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat . that is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat .
0	i ordered this through walmart.com and received it damaged , but walmart and/or storkcraft use a distributor called seko worldwide . the seko delivery truck delivered the crib . so either this is a storkcraft problem or a seko problem , but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off . walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box . hopefully the next crib wo n't be damaged , but if so , i am giving up on storkcraft completely . walmart did n't have a rating system to leave comments , and when i saw others on this website that had damage problems , i wanted to relay my experience as well . walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee , which was large . i then received the second crib and it was spotless . the delivery man from seko worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location . i also emailed storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews , they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece ( but no mention about the dented/chipped piece ) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer . i was not impressed . i was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib . i put it together myself , all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great . i only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy storkcraft in the future .
0	my daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time . i even tried to put a towell to make it less steep , but it did n't work . worst yet , her head would slide off the edge . i guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around
1	good things : ( 1 ) no interference . we live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs . ( 2 ) connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement . i 've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems . ( 3 ) you can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery . only one bad thing -- the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless . they are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband
1	my baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room , my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare . when reflux got better at month 4 we finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool , it has rechargeable batteries , image and sound are clear enough , night vision works perfect , monitor is not bulky at all ( no color at all though ) , and we managed to tie camera to the crib 's headboard and worked great for us .
1	this monitor is pretty good . it pick up my little one 's little noises so i can get to her before she awakens . it does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars ( which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long ) . i do have high praise for the fisher price exchange service . i had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor did n't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from amazon was up . then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working . i was able to send it to fisher-price and they exchanged it in less then ten days ! ( no questions asked
1	i bought this for my second son who is a year old . i love it . it 's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag . after he eats , i take it to the restroom and it rinses right off . i 've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well ( and saves my floors ! ) . i recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this ! !
0	i bought this chair used and i do n't think it 's worth the $ 50 i paid for it . i also have the fisher price chair ( i have twins ) and that one is so much better - i wish i had 2 of those . first , like everyone has said , it is ridiculous to clean . those people who said it 's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess . gross food particles collect in every crease and corner , especially under the seat . most importantly , the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight . the tray also does n't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap . finally , the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand . the fp high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher . only buy this chair if the only thing you care about is how it looks
1	i love these little books ... they play music.. good for before bed , my girls can chew on them ( which makes both me and my two year old son happy ) ... just fantastic ... great buy
1	a great success . i love all kiddapotamus products , that i bought so far because they are well-done , thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all , they are really very handy . we went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself . without that mat , we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out . the placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left . best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit , eat and play - on our table . he was really happy about it . after our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag . i was really satisfied
0	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great . but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas . when they 're using the bottle , you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips . every time my little girl uses them , it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them . i would recommend dr.brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these . ultimately , the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause
1	i used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space . the kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces ( i.e . 72 inches total ) , so if you need extra length , you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length . the extension was easy to use and is very sturdy . the gate looks uniformed and you can not tell it is several separate pieces . the only 'issue ' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door ( i.e . 24 inch section with the open/close swing door ) or use it as an end piece . i was not able to continously connect extensions to one another ( not sure if i did this incorrectly or not . ) but nonetheless , the extension worked fine and i love my new gate
0	i registered for this sling , and was thrilled when i received it as a shower gift . i could n't wait to use it . when my son was about 3 weeks old , i tried to put him in it . we both instantly hated it . its far too bulky to use with an infant , and it does n't adjust small enough to fit my frame ( i 'm 5'6 '' and far from skinny ) . i kept it , thinking that my son would eventually fit in it , and perhaps as he got bigger i 'd be able to wear it . wrong . i wish i 'd brought it back when i could still return it . my son is now 11 months old and we still ca n't use this sling . there 's no way he can sit in it securely . he hates being held but ca n't walk yet so i was really hoping we could use this , but it still does n't fit me , and my 24 pound son is n't held safely in it . he can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds . i 'm expecting again , and hoping i can find something much better than this for this baby
1	i like this product very much . it is very soft , unlike the other tubs where i was scared that my son would hit his head . the only drawback i have about is the belt ... .maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant . other than that i would recommend it to anyone . it looks very comfortable too . especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system
1	i breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the medela pump back then . i trusted medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year . i pump once a day , so they get used , but not abused . the model has changed some , i think it is more powerful this time . the thing i do n't like , but certainly can live with , is the motor not being attached to the breast shield . my chest is rather large , so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option . i have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap . i ca n't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because i do n't have a free hand . i leave the speed where i need it before and take the bottle off while it 's still on and put it in the bottle holder while i turn the unit off . i still very much like this product as it gets the job done
1	we received the original co-sleeper as a gift . we also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard . the main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up . the original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard . the playard capacity is up to 50 pounds , most brands are only rated to 30 lb . similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb . and most brands go to 15 . the co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard . the width is 28 '' so the co-sleeper can go through our 29 '' doorways without collapsing , unlike several playards that are around 31 '' . there is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons , then it 's easy . ( otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens ) this is explained on their website and should have been included in the manual . i had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad i chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly . also , the arm 's reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and i 'm confident it 'll keep the cats out
0	sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product . buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well . same pillow but the fleece-like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual `` luxury . '' more comfortable for mom and baby . wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out . we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it 's still like new . in another class from the `` chintzie '' alternatives offered at other stores
1	i have a climber ! she could climb out of her crib at age 13 months . she was way too young for a bed . we also have the crib tent ii and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night -- not roaming her room or house while we sleep . it was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room , putting a mattress on the floor , and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe . life saver
1	i bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and i am glad i did ! i did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks i found were either much more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features . my 7 month old daughter loves this backpack . in addition , we do n't need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets . i did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use . i originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but i can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well . i do n't know how it would do for serious campers , but for every day use it has been great .
0	leaking , slipping , ca n't use over the kitchen sink . horrible design .
0	this machine is not loud enough , i have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine ( made by lifewise ) in my boys room ... .my boys sleep through anything , the dog , the door bell ... whatever it is ... but this machine just does n't cut it unless you live in a sound proof house..
1	i have n't traveled with the bag yet , but the quality seems good . the bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal . my stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized . the stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag ( the top thin long end is where the zipper is ) . they are removable wheels , so its no problem . with all the wheels on , the bag ca n't zip closed . that is why i gave it only 4 stars . i bought the bag because i will be traveling overseas soon and i do n't want my stroller damaged during the long flight .
0	i bought this thermometer and liked it but after i used it a few times the buttons stopped working and i could n't turn it off . i opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it . a bath thermometer should at least be waterproof
0	i bought this stroller for when we had our second child . my children are 19 mo . apart . i had the aria single stroller for my first and loved it . this one is definitely not the same . for one thing , it is very hard to steer and get over bumps . the wheels are always getting stuck . second , it is hard to close . the most frustrating part is the steering issue . also , my aria decal fell off as well many months ago . i 've only had the stroller for nine months . one more thing , the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun .
1	i liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece . my baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so . i also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider i could adjust the wedges . one more thing this comes with a mat . this saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much . i bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick
1	i bought this pump after the avent isis failed me along with an electric pump . the fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great . im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes . although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy . from reading the other reviews i think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable . remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply . if you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby . and they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday .
0	my 8 1/2 mo . granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night . i 've got the correct bumper pads , etc . but babies do move . she had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset . i 've only had the crib 1 week , she 's gotten her leg stuck 2 times . we caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer .
1	when we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it ... they gave us the diaper depot as well . i love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table . it has lasted two kids before the one it 's on now , so a total of three babies . i guess like anything if it 's taken care of properly it wo n't break
0	i received this sheet and was immediately disappointed . the quality is very cheap and it was n't a perfect fit . i am surprised that this is made by graco - usually their products are good . i would not recommend buying this . i would buy a regular crib sheet instead .
