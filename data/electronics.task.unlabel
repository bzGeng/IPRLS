I purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad. It will run my cable modem, router, PC, and LCD monitor for 5 minutes. This is more than enough time to save work and shut down. Equally important, I know that my electronics are receiving clean power. I feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply. As always, Amazon had it to me in &lt;2 business days 
First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin 
We bought this to backup the iMac G5 that I got my wife for Christmas. I have had an APC since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area. The overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money. I'm not sure if the Powerchute software was updated to run on Mac Tiger, howvever, so I did not install it. Steve Reis 
It's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw -- beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power. This person obviously didn't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the UPS. The notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software. I agree that I was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem. Luckily, it was easy to turn this feature off. Five stars for this product, for sure. 
I ordered 3 APC Back-UPS ES 500s on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at APC. I've had them for about a month now without any problems. They've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions. I'll gladly order more if the need arises. Pros: - Large plug spacing, good for power adapters - Simple design - Long cord Cons: - No line conditioning (usually an expensive option 
I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage. 
I already knew how good this product was before we bought it. We had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer. I have recently learned I might have been able to have that replaced if I had thought to follow up. But I was just so thrilled to have only lost an $80.00 (at that time) product and not a $1,200 computer. When ordering mine, the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one, I got free shipping, I never even had to leave the house! I couldn't be happier!! 
Wish the unit had a separate online/offline light. When power to the unit is missing, the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds. The warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it isn't always easy to tell what is happening 
Electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks, usually at night, but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day. Very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work. This backup battery takes care of that problem very well. It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works. No linux software but it can still be used without it. The unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery. I have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it 
It was easy to assemble and matches another one that I bought from the same company a few years ago 
I have three of these CD towers, and in general I'm very pleased with them. I like the wave design, and they hold a LOT of CDs. I don't mind having to take off a whole stack of CDs to get to the one on the bottom, and as long as you balance the distribution of CDs properly, they don't tip that easily. I always place mine next to a wall, anyway. My biggest problem is that they are sometimes very difficult to put together. Of course, that is only a temporary issue, although an incredibly vexing one. 
I've had my Wave CD storage rack for almost 5 years now and I'm more than happy with it. It's been moved around, bumped and wedged between pieces of furniture, yet it has held on quiet nicely. I was originally attracted to it's wavey design which for me, is more artwork than just another storage case. I plan to buy another one 
This product is a great deal. The problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination. Get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires (they fit perfectly). Friends will compliment you on your post-modern taste and sense of design as well! They will use up about 10 CD's worth of space but then you still have storage for about 100 standard cd-cases or 200 thin ones. 
cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes. again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds.... 
as someone else mentioned its not the sturdiest rack out there, but it has not tipped over on me so i really cant complain. it looks good, and its easily put together. as for the sturdy issue, i look at it like this. since when do you place cd racks in the middle of the room?? NEVER!! people will typically place them in the corner of a room which is fine and you will NEVER have an issue with the rack at all. i have mine set right near the entrance of the bedroom door and i have brushed up against it and bumped elbows with it, and it ever so slightly moved a little but nothing where i was worried about it falling. oh and i have carpet in my room which makes it for a less sturdy foundation. i have even thought about purchasing another one for dvd's. personally speaking i def recommmend this cd rack 
I have never had this device fall over like others have complained of, either. Granted, I do have mine situated one a hard wood floor but even so - it seems sturdy enough. It is a little irritating with the wave structure how some of CDs won't fit but other than that I find this tower really helpful. It's a nice and fun way to store your CDs 
It's a nice look, but it tips over very easily. It is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows. My advice is if you need a CD rack that holds a lot of CD's? Save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy

The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home. Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before. I will address the concerns of a few reviews here. 1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound. 2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc. 3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc. 4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black. Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00. 5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle. Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one. But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables. 
I was blown away by the sound quality. Good system at a reasonable price. I would recommend this system to all my friend 
I had read some other reviews stating that this Home Theater System makes a buzzing noise. However, I had my doubts so I ordered it anyway and it's great. No buzzing noise on mine at all. I have an apartment and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that I couldn't really use anyway because of noise restrictions. This system is nice and clear and gives me the Home Theater Experience I was looking for. They give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall. Granted the speaker wire isn't all that thick, and has a proprietary male/female connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain. It still sounds great and for under $200 bucks why would you care anyway. 
We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco. It is possible that the newer "D" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode. We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder. When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room. It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful. I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all. Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again 
A very good player at a very reasonable price. 
This is prob. the best item I`ve boughten this year..!!! Totaly awsome system TV, Radio, Surround all in one..! Great buy. 
I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for 
Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more 
packaging by mfg doesn't keep tabs from being broken off, but vendor was great 
These clear jewel cases make it easy to see what you have and the slim design saves space. I use them for cd's and dvd's. I haven't had any problems with them; they are a good value 
these are very good for dvd or cd storage. very inexpensive and very good quality. people who complain below have fat fingers, thats why they break the cases 
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money 
Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you 
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them. On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well 
I knew these were inexpensive CD cases, but I can't even open one without it breaking into two pieces.. 
Cheaper than thick CD cases and less prone to breakage, these "slim" cases by Memorex protect your CDs. Most buyers will get them for use in CD or DVD burning, and these are an affordable choice from a quality company for that purpose. You may want to consider larger cases depending on your tastes, but otherwise these will probably satisfy your needs 
This pack offers a cheap pack of 50 slim jewel cases. Buying this package with a spindle of DVDs or CDs is much cheaper than buing CDs or DVDs ready in a case. The look is cool, and these will not break easily 
I wish they had a rating for zero stars. I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters. That's a 24% success rate. I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters. Memorex has really gone downhill. 
I have used these DVD+Rs for over two years now and they work absolutely great. I have burned movies, games, files, everything. Haven't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the DVD players I tried them out on. Not much else to say 
I hope it's live because if it's memorex, it's crap! that's my latest opinion after using this product. I have a LiteOn SOHW-802S and it hates Memorex. I rarely get a decent burn. More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it. My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together. So disappointing! Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate! [... 
I just finished a 25 package of the Memorex 4.7GB 4x DVD +R Media and have reordered a 50 pack and 25 pack. All my DVD burns were successful. I am using a Sony DVD drive and have been burning my home video creations at 4x with MYDVD software that came with the drive. I have a Kenwood DVD player downstairs and a Sony DVD player upstairs. It plays on both, plus I have made copies for friends with all positive feedback. I highly recommend these discs. 
I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill. I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks. In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?). That appears to have been a waste of money. I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row. I was convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else. Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one. Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch. That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty. Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio. Bye Memorex 
I just burned my first home video DVD on the Memorex DVD+R disc. It worked the first time! I have a TDK Burner installed in my Dell computer. The resulting disc works on my wife's Gateway laptop with DVD and also my Pioneer home DVD player. So far so good...no coasters. 
I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and "hope" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters 
The cost plus shipping still beats the sale price of a similar item at Walmart. Works fine 
This is a great product, and you can get it, along with any other products on Amazon up to $500 Free! Participate in a special promotion and get a free $500 Amazon Gift Card at this web site: nocostnow.info/amazo 
I have nothing to compare them to, but I bought 3 of these and they seem to do the job they are intended to do. I was surprised to see no savings on shipping when I ordered 3 vs ordering 1 at a time, although I am now clear on the policy. They still were a bargain, as far as I have compared. I would buy again, from the same vendor 
I was excited when I received the Kingston 256MB digital card on the scheduled date. It sure has a good packaging and works great. An item worth having in your electronics line 
I have had no problems with the Secure Digitial Card from Kingston. It has performed properly for my camera and computer for transferring the pictures. Highly recommende 
I use this card in my Palm TX pda and have it filled with mp3 music and in almost two months have had no problems with it. Very good memory 
Hi I brought 256 MB Kingston SD card from Amazon.com recently. According to my openion Amazon is one of the best online shopping market, they deliver the products intime and the items i brought so far are working very well. 256 MB Kingston SD card working very good with out giving any problem. One can always go to Amazon for online shopping. bye kira 
I received it in a timely manner and am pleased with the performance of the product. It may not be a top name brand, but I can't tell any difference. Thank yo 
I bought this card with my Canon Powershot SD200. The card holds a lot of pictures, more than I expected even with a high resolution setting 
This once available product has served me well. Very dynamic, universal in use, and user friendly. What more could be asked of a simple battery backup system that doesn't cost hundreds of $. I'm looking for the replacement because it's best duty is under every critical user's computer 
High speed reader that works flawlessly and at high speed. All you need for your card and computer 
While I read the reviews on this machine, it is clear to me that Lexar has some serious quality-control problems. For some people it worked, for others it was a miserable failure. I am in the latter group. Sigh. Mine was dead on arrival. I tried the device with *BOTH* of my Windows-XP machines and in both cases, it was unrecognized. Lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help 
I got this Item and it worked for about 4 hours, then stopped working, I tried the reader in 2 different computers nothing... I contacted Lexar customer support and they couldn't help me, save your money and buy something else 
Compared to other card readers I have experienced, this one is quick and easy. much preferred method of transferring digital images. gets the job done 
I used this reader for a week before it stopped working. It worked OK for the week that it worked at all. It would not read xD cards though. It did not detect that a card was inserted at all. I tried inserting the card fully, partially and even tried jiggling it a little. It seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted. It did, however, work with my compact flash card. Then, inexplicably, it stopped functioning entirely. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in Device Manager but the card was dead. I tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all. Lexar support left a lot to be desired. I explained the problem in detail and the response I got was a generic "Try restarting the computer, etc, etc." Then, they wanted me to pay for shipping to RMA their defective merchandise. I sent it back to Amazon instead and got my money back. I'm willing to assume that I just got a lemon, but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a refund rather than a replacement. 
I love the design and the size of this memory card reader. Very portable and works great. Reads pretty much all memory cards that are out there on the market at the moment. Would recommend it and would buy it again 
I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their "tech support" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, "try another Xd card". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk 
The Lexar Media 2.0 cannot function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from Olympus. The help site explains how, with my Mac, I can reboot my computer in OS 9 Classic then, download the pictures, then reboot in OS X. Not a satisfactory solution. I felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase. I feel like I simply acquired electronic junk. There was no response from Lexar when I emailed support, which simply added to my feeling of being had 
My biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my Win98 (not SE) machine. Ive only used it with Compact Flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine. No install problems either, even though the machine/OS is pretty old. The "pop down" door is a little goofy, but I just stick a pencil in the door to keep it from closing. This props it up on the desk so it is a bit easier to get the cards in and out 
Compact, portable and works with all the popular media cards: cf I/II, sm/mmc, sd/xd and mms/mmsp. I have one at home and one at the office, both you can take anywhere and doesn't take up alot of space. Easy to use, plug play. Nice cover opens up and keeps the slots clean from dust when closed. The lid opens and acts as a stand for the reader, a nice angle for putting in the cards. I got mine for less than $10.00, so it's definitely worth it! Lexar has great quality and good design. Highly recommended 
The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses. The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set. The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time. It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket 
First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!! 
I just ordered the second one for our family. It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould. They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use. The software is simple. The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time. My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have. Mom loves that they're affordable 
This is the greatest little MP3 player!!! The sound is great (good bass), the size is very convenient and everybody who see it, wants one. It fits in a pocket, has an armband option or a key ring option, even little speakers as an option. I've taken it on so many trips. There is a caution though, even though the software is good for Windows Plus or better, you can not download from the web unless you have Windows XP 
Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library. I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1 
This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what "hold" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use 
Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment 
i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true...and sure enough they rejected my upcs (i kept copies) only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional 
This product was perfect. it's a sturdy case that holds my large collection of cd's and dvd's. My other cases were flimsy and wore out fast. This one has a hard outside shell and the inside holds my dvd's nicely. So i have no complaints. and at the price i paid i'd say this was a great deal 
I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T. I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email. I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through! The product itself seems okay. I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet. However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around. A very dishonest company if you ask me. Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate 
In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment 
I also bought this item. Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC. Rebate denied because UPC was not included. I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it . Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained. To date, have heard nothing from them. I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC. Ji 
I have a collection of over 1500 disks so I have bought many cd/dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that I have purchased. I would avoid this brand. [... 
This is a great CD/DVD holder. especially for the price. It holds an unbelievable 264 DVDs!!! definitely good buy 
Witht this memory card you will not miss anything. Lot of space and fast storage for your continuos shooting 
I am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices, however, with my Panasonic SV-SD80 MP3 player, this product was not compatible. I could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to SD Audio support 
With my five megapixel Leica Digilux 2, this Lexar one gigabyte SD card will give me 244 color photographs at the highest-quality jpeg setting! That's equivalent to ten rolls of 35mm film. The write time is (to me) quite fast, so it really performs. So far, I have not encountered any problems with this SD card. And if it stays that way, I'll get another one. 
If you snap shots in burst mode, or if you want to take pictures at sporting events, fast cards like those are the way to go. Almost no lag, large capacity, lifetime warranty, no complaints 
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries. The Lexar Media 1GB SD Card SD1GB -32-231, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera. One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card. Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 1000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button. I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs 
This is a very practical way to use the "lost" spot on outlets by the transformers that will use at least 2 spaces with this you can even add 2 in one contruction is good and again is practical 
I purchased this game pad due to good reviews. Found it online for $15 with free shipping so had to try myself. Its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand. The programming software is alright as well, not as nice as the Nostromo n50/52 software for example. But what i didnt like about it was much more relavant. Firstly there is a toggle lock shift button. This button is easy to press by accident and since it is not a momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian. Interupting game play. Also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb, and quite far from normal thumb use. I had a hard time using those buttons quickly. Also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10. And finally, for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in NHL06, i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back, and ill soon go with the logitech 
I have had this controller for just about two years and have had no technical issues with it at all. I never installed any software for it, I simply plugged it in and it has worked flawlessly ever since. It may lack the frills of a more expensive controller, but I am very pleased with its toughness. Until there is a game pad for the PC that can accomplish this level of quality while including all the other bells and whistles, I'll stick with the durability feature instead 
I installed this controller on winXP. While I was playing an emulated game I noticed that my keyboard didn't work and there was no way to exit out of the game (alt+enter) to minimize the screen. So i reset the computer and now the keyboard doesn't work at all, must be something to do with that installation CD. I recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual, on creating a restore point, that you can go back to, incase something like this happens 
I nearly bought a Logitech gamepad but saw the glowing reviews of this device. I just got started back into the action and racing genres It's got great touch and seems sturdy enough for the long haul 
I bought this game pad to replace my logitech wingman rumble pad and it works great and its alot better than the wingman rumble pad. I highly recommend this gamepad 
This has got to be the best looking and best performing joysticks out there for the PC. Not only is the performance and feel of this joystick great..but the price is also great. Ta 
I got two of these, and as others have said, this is a great game pad for the money. It feels sturdy and has good, well placed, buttons. 
I got this for my baby's room. I was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews, but it's quite good (though I don't have the ear of an audiophile). The bass is pretty powerful the treble is good as well. There is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well. The room is about 10'x11' and this stereo has more than enough capacity for this room. MP3 cd's appear to work effectively. Panasonic has generally had good MP3 cd support (subdirectories are supported). I'm very pleased 
It's amazing how tough it is to find boomboxes that have CD players capable of playing MP3 CD's - apparently, the industry has decided that most people don't want this feature in their CD boombox (they must assume people get their MP3 fix from iPods and similar devices). But for those of us who've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest iPod (I think the latest version is down to a quantum-level size device), this is a solid player for that purpose. And the cassette player/recorder is also handy if you want to tape from your MP3 CD (or any CD, or the radio) for the benefit of those you may know who still haven't gone to CD yet (there are still a few of those out there as well). Generally, this is a good product, though there are a couple of drawbacks. First, the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries. This seems kind of silly given that remotes aren't exactly power hogs. Now, this could simply be a quirk of mine, and may not be a feature of the product overall, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one, so I've decided to live with this (it's not often it'll be on pure battery mode). The other minor complaint is that it's not possible to fast-forward within an MP3 track when playing an MP3 CD (regular CD's can fastforward within a track). Not sure why it doesn't, since every other MP3 CD player I've come across does (discman, car MP3 CD player, etc.), but it's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view. The sound equalizer is very minimal, but truthfully I wasn't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall, and things in-between. I found no problem with the modes available, and find that this is doing the job I needed it to do just fine 
The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations. The radio part, hence, was worthless. The speakers are sub standard, no depth. Without the remote, little can be done. All in all, it is not worth trying. My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality 
Just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers, I was searching for CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. ADVANTAGES ARE: 1) The ONLY smaller desktop unit that I found with CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 2) Has sleep timer 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 and 120 minutes. This is handy for CD's, MP3's and the radio. 3) Fairly good sound for the money. 4) Easy to use remote. (I leave mine next to the unit). DISADVANTAGES ARE: 1) Earphone plug in the back of the unit. When I want to plug in my earphone, it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design! 2) My biggest disappointment--no resume on CD or MP3! I listen to alot of audio books and I find this a real inconveince! I have to go to the track that I think I left off or write it down! (My Panasonic MP3 CD small portable has this, why did they forget this in this one?). 3) Terrible reception on AM--STATIC! 4) Sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use. I bought this because it is the only AM/FM/CD/MP3/CASSETTE unit with a timer and remote that I could find! Since the AM radio is so terrible, I ended up buying the Sony ICF-M410V so I can listen to my AM talk shows. This one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes, a clock and easy to use. Overall, I still give it a 4 because of it's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes. **And, I wish I would have bought it on Amazon, not at Radio Shack (they were about $25 more). Live and learn! If you are looking for a all in one with CD, MP3, CASSETTE, REMOTE AND AM-FM RADIO, this is about the only one that you will find and I looked for 3 months! UPDATE: September 18, 2006: After owning this one month, I like it better and better! I love the SLEEP feature that you can use up to 120 minutes (2 hours) either on the radio or the CD! This AUTOMATICALLY shuts the unit off. It is a great feature if you are listening to a CD that contains 40 hours of MP3's on it and you don't want it to play all night 
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago. What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback. I agree that it could have been better. It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last. You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. 
I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future model 
couldn't find a boombox that was lightweight but sounded good and had mp3playback. It is fine, does everything I expected. It gets more useage than my hi priced Bose 
The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy. 
overall i'm very happy. i wish there was a resume feature for cds with mp3s on them. other then that - it's good 
I was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand, and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic, but when I received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work. Holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely. It does come with book page holders, but I don't really use them 
So I was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages... could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality... So i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11$. AND it works, I used it for two weeks now and I am pretty satisfied. Just like there is one more review on this item... and it says that it is strong and sturdy.. I AGREE. It is a great item for the money. Vitalijus Stony 
I have tried a dozen holders; this is the best available. Others tip over easily, or they hold only books of a limited size, or they are large, heavy, bulky, and therefore absurdly expensive, etc... This is light, yet sturdy. Hint: I included a few large metal clips, the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place. With the clips, this bookholder works excellently well. In addition, it is also preforated to fit into any three-ring binder. The manufacturer thought of everything on this one. I keep one in the car for when I read in restaurants, another at home, and still a third on my office desk 
Because I'm a free lance writer and reviewer, I often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when I'm direct quoting. I had a book holder from another company, but it was a piece of junk. It wouldn't hold up thicker books and the thin, rounded "holders" at the bottom kept popping off. I even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such. It kept breaking and out of frustration, I went to an office supply store to look for another one. The silver Fellowes Book Holder was all they had. Although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy, I was skeptical. I had him go into the office, get me a thick, hardcover book--and proceeded to take the Book Holder out of the box to test it. (Yes, right there in the store!) I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom. The plastic looks flimsy, but I'm tellin' ya, this baby really does well for holding open thick books! I've been using mine for about a week now and love it. No more headaches when I need to get a quote! YAY 
I read a lot and I was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page. I also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page. Well, I finally decide to try this nice little invention, and let me tell you, it's definitely worth it! It's cheap, but the plastic works fine and does the job well. It stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised. The stand is adjustable. It's great, it makes my life so much easier, and I'm sure glad I bought it 
I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it. However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets. Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one). Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding. The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold. Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books. I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem 
Sometimes I need to have a few books open at the same time, and still have clear desk space for note taking. I used to keep one in my lap, or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page, or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so I could open another. Not any more! Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway?? This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares? You're not going to loose them unless you've got a silver shag rug that's three inches deep, and it's not a big deal to pop them back in. In truth I have two of these pretty good book things 
This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs. It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders. The page holders are easy to put back in. It saves space on your desk. I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks. It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find 
I wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different PCs. The first, a Dell M50 Precision laptop with 1 GB memory and a 1.8 GHz processor, would capture sound just fine, but only color haze for video. I thought that it was because the M50 has underpowered USB 1.1 ports, so I wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop (also 1GB memory). The best that I got was audio with the sound speeded up (voices sounded like they were on helium) and the same color haze for video. Apparently, it doesn't pay to scrimp in this area. I will promptly return the product and look for something better. From the other reviews, it doesn't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent 
Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought. It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work. Don't buy. 
First of all, here are my computer specs: Pentium 4 2.8 GHz/800 FSB 1 GB DDR2 RAM 2 SATA 7200 RPM hard drives: 80 GB (boot drive), 250 GB (movie drive) Graphics card: ATI Radeon X300 PCIe 128mb Sound card: SoundBlaster Live 24-bit VCR: consumer-grade Sony SLV-N750 My DVD Xpress model number: USBAV-701 Rev. 2 My purpose: To archive old tapes to DVD. Installation of the drivers/software was a quick and painless process. Within minutes, I was already capturing my very first video. This unit works very nicely with retail VHS tapes (I found that it does not respond to Macrovision, though I only tested one tape), home movies, and off-air master tapes (tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts). At first, I captured a short promotional music video at 8 Mb/s in a resolution of 720x480. This produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape. There are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer, but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen. Then I captured a longer home movie, which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a single-layer DVD. My original bitrate of 8 Mb/s was too high, and the higher bitrate wasn't really helping the video quality too much. But if my bitrate is too low, the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a TV. Perform a google search for "videohelp bitrate calculator" and click on the Videohelp bitrate calculator link. I use the calculator to figure out what bitrate I should capture in, according to the total time of all the programs I want to put on DVD. Below 7 Mb/s seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback, but it's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies. After capturing this longer movie, I found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot. Now, whenever I operate it, I point a small fan at it, and this seems to keep it cool and running well. But keeping the unit cool shouldn't be the user's responsibility, so it loses points for temperature. While this device works well if the input video has a stable picture, a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss (being copied several times). I tried capturing one of these tapes, which was of a TV show from 1993, and the DVD Xpress did not handle it very well. The result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory. I am disappointed with this. On the other hand, I have a tape that was recorded from TV in 1988. It is the master copy, so there is no generational loss. DVD Xpress was able to capture it just fine. Not once during any of my captures did audio video get out of sync, so credit where credit's due to ADS Tech for that. After a few days of experimenting with this capture device, I definitely want to keep it. I look forward to finally being able to clean out my VHS closet. My recommendations to other buyers: Understand your source, and you won't be disappointed. There is no way you can make your 10-20 year old tapes look pristine again. But if the video signal is strong and stable, the DVD Xpress should be able to capture it with no problems 
I'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users. Currently I'm running an AMD64 3500+ with 1.5gig ram. The software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time I was recording my first transfer from a VHS player. I'm very comfortable using Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 so that's what I decided to use instead of the bundled software. I've created over 25 DVD's successfully and tonight I decided to give the "Direct to disk" a try. I recorded directly from the video source to the DVD and just like that, I had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my DVD player. I have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version 3.7. I have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes, there were many problems. But after upgrading to something with more power like the AMD64 with 1.5gig ram...well...it was a whole new ballgame. Everything worked as advertised. Just as it should 
I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row. I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks. 
if you don't want to spend a ton of money and you want the best quality possible. i am using the ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my DirecTV DVR onto DVD. The quality is outstanding. 2 quick complaints, but really these are only minor things: 1) setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure. the message should have said...."MAKE SURE THE USB CABLE IS PLUGGED IN DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOTHER BOARD"....in other words, in the back of your computer and with a USB port that came with your computer instead of an add on. easy enough fix, but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple. 2) on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video. This has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise, but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100% pure video with no errors. this is a great product....don't look any where else 
Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect? First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work. When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly. The driver software is very tolerant. You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device. So installation is a 5 minute process. Next comes the capture and initial encoding. Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI. Typical. But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content. The frame rate is full on 30 fps. It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal. Both are just fine in quality. The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up. Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though. As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight. It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset. Bottom line? This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails. Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder. Its a good value. 
This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price 
The DVD Express 2.0 worked the first time I tried it. It always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have. I agree that Ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit. If you are having trouble getting this little baby going I would suggest a computer class would be apropriate. 
I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone. I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future. 
Great value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product. 
This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price! 
This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home. It's a great card at a very good price 
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again 
This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures. When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology. I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos. I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow. Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy. Hope this is some hel 
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500. At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop. After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb. I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update. Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first 
Product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it. I am using it in an HP M425 5 megapixel digital camera. It will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound 
I'm a working photographer who has been, after several years use, getting write errors on my Lexar Professional CF cards 1 Gb and 2 Gb. I contacted Lexar about what to do and was told that the professional cards have a lifetime warranty and they are now in the process of replacing my cards, after 40K to 50K exposures on each. Quite happy with them 
I purchased these cards on recommendaton of a friend who is a professional photographer that has the same camera that I purchased. The Canon 20D likes these fast cards and it's other capacities which some other point and shoot cameras may not benefit. Check before you buy, as this card works very well with my camera 
I used this CF card with my Canon Rebel XT. Write and transfer speeds are fast enough and never keeps me waiting. But this works bcoz of speed acceleration technology. If your camera doesn't support this technology then its of no use. It comes close to USB 2.0 transfer rates. February 15th Update, finally this card failed. After formating the card will work for 15-20 snaps and will hang for ever after that and then the camera will throw a write error. Any amount of formating didn't correct the problem. Finally i have to dump it and now i am using one 1GB Sandisk Extreme III and another 2GB Sandisk Ultra II card. Both are working fine even after some bad handling 
Bought this card as a backup for the 1-GB card I normally use, and it's been fast and dependable so far. My 7 megapixel camera produces large files -- lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting, but with this card that hasn't happened yet. Good purchase. Also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar 
I had no problems with this card and the delivery was prompt... Thank You Muc 
I purchased this media card for my Nikon digital camera. The 5.1 mega pixal size doesn't matter. I still manage to get almost 400 digital photographs and hundreds more if I adjust it to 3.2 mega pixels. I would recommend this media card to anyone with a digital camera 
After going through the reviews, I bought this CF card for my Canon Digital Rebel. So far it has worked fine, though I don't pretend to be an expert digital photographer. When the card is empty, it shows 127 shots available. It seems to read reasonably fast, though it takes a bit longer than I was used to with my point-and-shoot Olympus and its SmartMedia card. 
After Amazon got off there (...) and decided to deliver this item, which took 2 weeks, everything has been really good. The 80X speed has helped my camera's performance (Olympus C-8080. Paid $56 dollars for it and am quite satified with purchase 
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality. I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !! Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology ! 
If you own a Canon camera, Canon does NOT support WA (Write Acceleration) feature of Lexar's high-speed cards: http://www.lexar.com/digfilm/wa_cf.html Current camera partners supporting Write Acceleration Technology: -Kodak Professional -Nikon -Sanyo -Sigma -Pentax -Olympus Other than that, this is a FAST card, if your camera supports WA, otherwise, it may run at just standard speed and in that case why spend the extra $$$? Look up your camera on the link before you buy 
Just purchased 3 units , thought they would work as well as the Novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range . My original Novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn , these only work in the same room... I am attempting to return these currently. 
I just purchased a set of two 4 channel Westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently. If I tipped one of the units, it worked sometimes, as though it had a bad connection. I am trying to return them now to the seller. Good luck if you purchase a set of these. They seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set 
The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling. I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice. Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger. If your having problems, I would start with unplugging other things first. Overall, these have been a Godsend, wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house. Used to drive me crazy 
I have a 4300 square foot home. I have purchased Novi wireless intercoms in the past and need to add to them. One has been in the room above the garage, one in the kitchen, and one in the basement near the computers. Those locations are not on the same circuit. I have never had any trouble getting them to work -- I've just had a couple wear out. In fact, at our old house, we could pick up communications from our neighbors across the street who had a set and we finally each decided which channel we'd use so we didn't hear each other's conversations! You might want to remember that when you use them! Clearly our neighbors intercoms weren't on the same circuit -- they weren't even in the same house! Maybe the newer ones (mine are at least six years old, but they are Novi wireless intercoms that you plug into the wall) have changed, but I've never had a problem like the one described. Maybe it's peculiar to the Westinghouse brand 
I bought a set of four Westinghouse intercoms. Usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and don't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people. These Westinghouse intercoms (and I believe the same goes for the NOVI intercoms) require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit (that is, controlled by the same electrical breaker). So, if your kitchen, family room, master bedroom, and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system, the Westinghouse system will not work for you. Intercoms are usually for large houses...large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets...hence, this product likely will not work for most people. I replaced the Westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the WireFree Intercom Reporter...this is a four channel system and it works great...works either with batteries or transformer...it is independent of the electrical circuits 
This is not technically a review, although based on what I've read I do plan on buying one of these. However, I found something on smarthome.com which will inter-connect the two main circuits that most houses have, thus allowing devices like this (and X10) work from any outlet to any other. This is not yet tested by me, but is at least promising. Device is here: http://www.smarthome.com/4816b2.html Explanation is here: http://www.smarthome.com/images/4816dgm_big.jp 
I just purchased this unit and once I finally got it working I could not be more pleased. Just be warned that it was not as easy in my two story home to just plug one in upstairs and come downstairs with the other and have it work right away. Maybe I just have some "funky" wiring in this house, BUT I had to make about 6 trips up and down those stairs with a friend standing by the unit I wanted in the master bedroom while I tried various plugs upstairs until we finally got the things to work. All the electrical receptacles work fine, so I don't know why it did not work on the first try. Once working they are great...just keep in mind flexibility of placement in the event you have an experience similar to mine. I'm going to order another set to use between the den and my husband's workshop and feel they are a great deal for the cost and so much easier than a "hard wired" system 
I bought this card to go with my Canon 30D and have not been let down. I can get about 500 JPEGs and 300 RAW. SanDisk makes highly constant products. I can set the 30D to take high speed continuos shooting and take 5 RAW pic's and not have the card slow down my camera. Very happy with it 
This is a good compact flash card. This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive. 
I received this item for use in a new digital SLR 8.3mgpxl camera. It is fast and stores excellent pictures 
This card is fast and is the right price. It holds tons of high res JPEGS, and around 200 RAW images (on my Rebel XTi). Highly recommended 
Bought this card along with a Rebel XT as a gift for my girlfriend. It's been performing without a hitch so far, though on burst mode, there is transfer lag: in that, the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card, and so after the burst, the pictures are still being written to memory 
I have an EOS Digital Rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade, at first I thought to buy a 1Gb Sandisk memory, but due to the price fall of memory cards I decided to buy the 2Gb card instead. When I inserted the card into the camera, it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in Large/Fine format or 262 in RAW format, that's more than I need even for a one week vacation trip, but if I upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for JPEG+RAW storage. I may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old 128Mb memory card, about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures. I have always trusted in SanDisk products and this card is no exception, quality and performance is as good as I expected 
I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone 
I have been using CF card now for a while in my Nikon d-200. I have been very pleased with its response time. In multi shot mode it keeps up with the camera and I never have to wait. Highly recommended 
Hard to be verbose about a CF card...but it has performed without a hitch in my Rebel XT. Used a 1GB Ultra II when I bought the camera a year ago, picked up the 2GB card before a family vacation in August. Excellent product, no worries 
I have had nothing but good experiences with SanDisk products. This 2GB Ultra II card keeps up with my new Nikon D200 without any problems. It's speed is also a plus when transferring the files to my PC 
This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices 
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice 
This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
PROS Small Cute Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup. USB 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well. Runs cool. CONS Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them. The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated. Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough. Overall good value for price 
This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs). It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer. And I still have 3 more ports. And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub. It does what it says 
I bought four of these and returned them immediately. Two were dead out of the box. A third had horrible sound. After searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102) Beautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year. Anyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty 
I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters. Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands. Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use. Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions. Don't waste your money 
Truely wireless, the remote alert sender unit runs on 4 AA batteries. I don't know yet how long they last. Mine are now two weeks old and still good. The unit senses when ANY movement passes by. I live in the country and now I know when someone comes in the yard. Before I wouldn't always hear the car. Only drawback is that it picks up deer, dogs and other critters walking past at all hours of the day and night. I like this unit. It serves a purpose for me that other people may not have, but it works as advertised and nothing gets past it without it alerting me. The range is said to be 1000 ft. That is probably correct. Mine is about 300 ft. fromt he reciever unit and it works great. The two way "voice" speaker is the icing on the cake. I love being able to yell at the neighbors dogs to "get on out of here". It's a real hoot to watch the surprise they get when my voice comes out of the tree. I have less problems with the neighbor's dogs coming into my yard and bothering 'my' pets now 
The Dazzle 6-in-one is perfect. I have used it to transfer photos/files from my husband's camera (Sony Memory Stick), from my camera (ComapctFlash), from my Ipaq (SD card), and will try it with my new camera (SD card). It's is way easier than bringing the USB cord and each camera with me. This is one of the best purchases this non-techie has ever made. (I have had this for over 2 years with no problem. 
Bought this from amazon. Worked well for compact flash cards. Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera). so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera. And all of a sudden, it died on me. Had to throw it out 
Simply plug and play. Additionally Dazzle Reader shows up as a separate drive under Window's. Easy to move files back forth to the reader. Only glich is the stand -- very flimsy.. wish they had a better stand but the product is great and excellent price too .... 
This is a great product. I would recommend people to buy dazzle card reader. I had this for over 3 months or so. Have not have any problem. I would say, but this one when a deal come by! D 
This reader (and writer) is absolutely fantastic! I bought this after returning the Biostar 6 in 1 reader from Newe*g. That unit would not read two SmartMedia units I had but the Dazzle knocked it out like a champ. I use it for Compact Flash and SM (4 different brands) and everything works great on the Dazzle. After the rebate the price is hard to beat! 
This is a great purchase. I'm very happy with the performance, quality and time to charge. 
They last and last, but get two pairs so you have some spares. Need to recharge every week whether or not you use them. A great product 
I have been using a Minolta S414 digital camera. The batteries that came with it were only 1600 mAmps. I never got through an entire ballgame without having the batteries run dry. Of course I carried a spare set, but this was less than ideal. I got these 2000 mAmp Monsters and I must say they deliver what they promise. As a result, I've really not needed the backup set, even when shooting games that went into extra innings! The charger is well made, very quick and has easy LEDs to see the charge status from across the room. Overall, this has been a great purchase 
Just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers. It does just what it's intended to do - produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit. I had no trouble at all with the remote - it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the iPod from a good 10 feet away. My only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful! Altec Lansing could do well to improve their in-box instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself. I was almost ready to return my unit initially when I discovered - only by accessing Altec Lansing's web page for the iM3 - that I had to remove the not-too-obvious plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my iPod 4G 60GB photo. Otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price 
When I bought it couple weeks ago. I look out side the box is IM3, But inside the box speaker is IM3c. I call the company, they told me IM3 is as IM3c. They said someone on the internet sell the IM3 is all same with the IM3c, And IM3c also support the Ipod video too 
I bought mine for travel purposes and use the JBL On Stage more when I am at home. The JBL does sound better but I got a decent price on the Altec, it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option. So I took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night. Thats 4 AA per night. Not exactly cheap. I think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using. I was out of the country but I still wish now that I wouldve taken my "heavy" adaptor with me. You live and learn. I guess everyone has special needs, but in this case I can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night. So, these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right. Packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system. Its ok, Id give it more of a 3.5 star if I could. 
I am very happy with this product. It folds super slim, so traveling with it is a breeze! Pretty good sound - not Bose quality, but for the price, very respectable! I've had it almost a year, and it has been along on many weekend get-aways, and works great. I use it alot, so it was a good purchase for me 
I received this as a Christmas gift and while it's compact, there are a couple of major flaws. The power button is the only thing on the remote that works. None of the other controls on the remote work. Second, it's VERY BASIC. I would have preferred something that had some "sleep" or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control. The only positive comments I have about this are that it's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf, and it charges the iPOD really quickly when it's docked. Otherwise, the sound is mediocre and the controls suck. 
+ Great sound quality + Powerfull enough to fill my living room (though probably not with 25 people in party mode) with a small footprint. - The remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv. (Probably because the remote is tiny and only has a watch-like battery, so not enough power). Overall, very good quality for a reasonable price. 
This system worked great for my 40 GB iPod. The carrying case and interchangable plug-ins are nifty for international travellers. A word of warning -- the 60 GB iPod Photo does not fit in the docking station. Altrec insisted that it does at the time I purchased it in July 2005. Be sure to order the "Altec IM3 for iPod and iPod Photo" that is now available if you have the Photo iPod. 
I bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas. With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more 
I don't have much room on my desk, but this copy holder fits perfectly and is still sturdy enough to hold up most texts. 
This is working out real well as a notebook stand for me. You can't beat the pric 
This product is [retty good, but don't even try putting a bood on it, the holder will tip over and it doesn't clip the pages of a book very well. But for papers it's good and it's adjustable, which is convient. It did hold my notebook very well, but for books it sucks. 
This holder keeps papers upright and in position, but it doesn't handle books particularly well, as the clip cannot grip surfaces as thick as most books and the base isn't as wide as most books when they're opened. I have this AND a book stand so I keep myself covered on both ends 
I'm amazed... simply amazed. The price is way out there... and this obviously isn't for everyone... but it does everything it says... well. Set up is super smooth, get the manufacturer and model number, type it in during set up on your computer, and it is done. Thats it. I do have multiple lighting and heating controls and it is a snap to set up as well. And then you can have the remote send the setup information to other controllers as well. Tip: Don't buy their lighting controls... WAY over priced. Anything that is Z-Wave will work... Leviton sells a line for 1/3 of the price 
I have to say that I was a little bit skeptical because of the large price tag but found out through research that this product was actually fairly priced due to the custom programming features it had. I quickly found out that this remote was better than other universals out there because it used RF and was able to control multiple AV systems in my house. I have not done it yet, but I plan to buy the Lighting products so I can turn off all of my lights at once from bed each night!!! Very cool 
I bought this reader because I wanted to avoid having my camera and all its cable attached to my pc to download the pictures; and with this reader I could leave my camera (and its cables) in its case and just download the picture with the memory card, I recomend this product.... 
I tried to install the driver on my computer. The computer went into a loop, just booting, shutting down, and rebooting. I was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point. I'm scared to try it again. Any body want it? I'll sell it cheap. For that matter, just pay the postage and it's yours 
I have used the device numerous times since the purchase and would highly recommend it. Would buy it again 
I got this from JnR . This unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it. I tried this on multiple computers. MAy be this was just a lemon. I will exchange it to a better brand 
WORKS FINE FOR ME BUT FOUND IT ON KODAK WEB PAGE FOR ABOUT HALF THE PRICE. THANK YOU 
I was impressed with the quality of pictures I got with this memory card. I have a very inexpensive camera but the pictures are terrific 
This is a high quality product, and can be used in several digital cameras with great results 
I gave this to my nephew for his birthday--hold lots of pics and videos (at least 250 pics). I wouldn't say it ever cost as much as the "marked down" price, but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores--about $15 cheaper. I am pleased. 
This card has all of the memory space required for my personal use. I would recommemd it to others 
Bought this item over a year ago and have had no problems with this card. It holds lots of pictures (depending on your settings) and hasn't caused me any problems. Well worth the money! I take lots of pictures of my son and anytime we go anywhere new, so it gets used a lot 
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries. The Kingston 128MB Secure Digital Memory Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera. I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs 
SD cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems. I don't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at Disney took place. I had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera (which I have since trashed for this incident and bought a new Nikon) but anyway I had over 300+ pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of DisneyWorld. I cried. So as a suggestion...clean off your Memory cards after each event and don't go for the 512MB or the 1GB cards unless you are putting video on it or etc. Now I am a happy person once again since my hubby's going to take me back to DW to replenish those missing pics! =) 
Bought this card for my XDA I PDA. Worked fine right out of the box. However, this only showed up as 118mb card !!! not sure if this is the SD card itself or the PDA causing the loss of some 10mb worth of space. Also it is slow to write to the card, but quite fast when reading from the card. 
The card works great in my camera. What more is there to say 
How good an alarm clock is basically comes down to this: When you set the alarm with the three or four settings you need to do--alarm on/off, radio/CD/annoying noise,volume, and in this case the track you want it to play or if you want it on shuffle or not--does it actually do what you specified the settings to do. The Sony Dream Machine does, and it features two equally accessible alarms as well so that husband and wife (or husband and husband or wife and wife as the case may be) don't need to argue over how to set the alarm for two morning schedules, along with convenient and easy to understand buttons for the radio presets and cd player controls. IMPORTANT NOTE: The two alarm settings are completely independent of each other, so one person can wake up to a CD and the other to a favorite radio station if they like. My wife is from Japan for instance, and she wants a Japanese pop CD in there, while I'm partial to waking up to NPR news. Best Feature--The Snooze button: It can be pressed multiple times at a shot to set how much time thereafter you want it to make another attempt at waking you, up to an hour later; and it's generously sized so that you can find it easily when you're not quite all there yet. Worst Feature--the lack of any sort of backup battery. For this price, they should just put in a long term one like computers have--providing just enough power to startup the system and remember settings. I'm pretty sure a battery like the one Sony features in my video camera (circa 1998, TR3000 bought in Japan) would do the trick while only needing very periodic replacement. Sound--good, not excellent, but it's an alarm clock, not a stereo. For a kid's room or for your general purpose needs, the sound quality is plenty good. No one needs 100 watts per channel, crystal clear sound to wake up to in the morning, and this little appliance does an exceptional job of serving both as an alarm clock and a handy, space-saving and attractive stereo. It's perfect for not only the bedroom, but the kitchen as well. For the performance to price ratio, you could only do better by blowing the wad for a Bose unit. Not for great-grandma: Younger grandparent-age people will probably be fine with it--say, as a gift--but if they're from the WWII generation or earlier, forget about it; in fact, forget anything with buttons or digital displays. Sony makes really excellent clock radios with the same reliable analogue features your grandparents have come to enjoy growing up but much improved, and they'll appreciate the thoughtfulness of such a gift much better--while this thing would just gather dust somewhere and be an entire waste of money or source of annoyance. If I had to remark on one real downside to this unit, it's that the backlight really is too bright to sleep with it pointing at your face--and be close enough to reach without getting up--while being on a setting that is readable when you're still bleary-eyed. Add that the control for the brightness is not conveniently located (it's on the back) so you couldn't just reach over in your half-coma state, brighten it, then turn it back down. They should have added a feature like outdoor electronics have--such as cycling computers and GPS units--where you can press a button, it lights up for a moment, then goes back to it's preset brightness. BOTTOM LINE: The best, most reliable, and enjoyable alarm clock I've ever owned. It's durable, easy to clean, looks nice, and features two utterly independent alarm settings--so you'll only need one--in addition to generous preset buttons and easy controls. It's really worth just exactly what Amazon is charging for it 
I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive. Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room. The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing. It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand. The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live. This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash. I won't miss it at all 
Too many disadvantages: 1. No battery backup 2. Even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance. 3. You'd be expecting better sound from this unit. It's acceptable with the radio, but CD sound quality is extremely poor. 4. etc. 
One thing I don't like about this clock radio is that it doesn't have a backup battery. Currently I usually do not need to rely on the radio waking me up in the morning, but when I do I make sure my Palm PDA is beside the bed to wake me if there was a power outage. I tried the weather channels once, and it didn't pick up very well. I have an older Sony clock radio (that loses time) that I can use for weather that picks up weather just fine. What makes this a winner for me is the extendable snooze and nap timers. Now if I want to take a nap I don't have to mess with setting one of the alarms. I just push one button several times and it's all set. I would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone. I use the extendable snooze occasionally, but I don't know if there is a point at which it no longer works -- some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze -- this makes it unusable for me because I don't trust myself knowing that when I am half asleep! Sound quality is great, I like how you can set the track of the CD and how loud it should be. All in all a pretty good clock radio, but if you rely on it and don't have a backup, the lack of battery backup is a serious problem 
Just purchased this Sony CD alarm clock and I have to say most reviewers are right on target. While it has superior sound quality and features than the competition, the rear light is very bright and the clock display is almost impossible to read from more than a few feet away. I placed a piece of electrical tape over the rear light unit to dampen the brightness and have decided to keep my 15-year-old Sony Dream Machine alarm clock plugged in next to the new one so I can see the time display off the old one from my bed. Still a satisfactory buy, because the competition produces hard to work,poor sounding crap 
This bookstand, despite the description, is not suitable for heavy books. If you put heavy books on this, the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off. 
Its made of flimsy plastic, and all the parts snap on. I'm afraid to put a heavy book on there, because I'm sure the parts will just snap off 
Looks slick, decent sound and great price BUT flimsy attenna and CD player broke after 1 week (on its own - I didn't even open it up after loading in the first group of CDs). Took it to JVC repair and they couldn't fix it or find out was wrong. Ruined my impression of JVC. Remember the wisdom "you get what you pay for". . . 
It was missing the FM antennae. But I was not intending to use the system for the radio. Overall, it is a great system!! Walt - Illinoi 
Pros: it's pretty Cons: it's garbage Sure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage! So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!) I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died. Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere. If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy.. 
The CD trays are a little flimsy, but this audio system really packs a whollop. The sound is excellent. For the price, it has a lot of features, such as Bass/Treble control, a sleep timer, and five CD trays. To get an enjoyable sound, I'm willing to take the risk that a tray may break. I just try to be extra gentle with the trays 
Wanted this for the new office, and it fit perfectly on the desk - looks great, and has great sound. The unit has a quality feels not "plastic". The remote works well, and I particularly like the fade mute - makes it easy to use. 
Strengths: sound, design, controls, 5CD changer, compact design Weaknesses: remote is not well designed (all buttons the same size), doesn't recognize folders on CDs Summary: I was shopping for a shelf system and this one caught my eye so I got it. The sound is excellent in my opinion for such a little system. The displey is also nice, very bright backlight which can be turned off (great when you like to sleep in the room while the system is still on). Overall I am extremely satisfied. The only minus is the remote, it has a lot of buttons and they are effectively the same size (I would prefer big ones for important things like volume, play, forward,... 
Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for "more than 3 weeks." I hope they will replace my unit with something that works 
Great appearance and sound, JVC has produced a nice sounding unit. Speakers look as great as they sound, no problem handling bass at loud levels. Tuner is very easy to use, USB input works flawlessly. Now the bad news, the CD mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any CD, whether store bought or MP3 burned. First unit died after three weeks, the replacement lasted five. CD player mechanical design is unable to handle light use. Will think twice about buying a JVC again.. 
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating. The compact flash card slot still works, though. I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it didn't work with their 4GB SD card. It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card. 
Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards, type M, doesn't recognize them. Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar, they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed 
I ordered a Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. I didn't know there was such a thing. When it came everything worked perfect and for a price everyone could afford 
Buyer beware. This reader does not work with large SD cards. I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card. My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work. I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet 
Completely satisfied with the Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. Simple and easy to use 
Easy to hookup and Windows XP displays the drives of the Lexar. Easy to drag and drop files into the drives. Highly recommended 
I used Lexar Media Multi Card REader in my P2120 Fujitsu laptop via a USB 2 PC-Card adapter. It's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in Windows XP 
This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices 
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice 
This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
PROS Small Cute Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup. USB 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well. Runs cool. CONS Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them. The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated. Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough. Overall good value for price 
This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs). It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer. And I still have 3 more ports. And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub. It does what it says 
I like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs, just set back and relax....YOUR COVERED. 
Sandisk CF is all I use.I have never had a problem. One card went through the wash and still works perfectly 
I purchased this memory card for a camera I was also purchasing. It was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page. When I received the card first and then the camera, I was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit. Because I had opened the plastic package to the card, I was unable to return it. In fact, when I emailed the company who sent it, I never even received a response. 
In general, I have realised that CF cards have a 1-2 years life. This is my 3rd CF card in 5 years, and my 2nd Sandisk card to-date. My first (also Sandisk) is still working, but its only 32MB so not very useful on long trips except as backup. With a 5 Megapixel Canon, this 512Mb card stores about 200 highest resolution images. Have used this for only 3 months so far, but have noted that the Ultra II is definitely faster than others. Quality and life seems to be better than the Viking cards I have used, but time will have to tell how true that is 
my compact flash card works just fine good here very fast. a very happy custome 
I was thinking about buying a 1G card, but after reading one of the reviews,I bought two 512 card,just in case that something went wrong. Which to me made a lot of sense. I'm please 
I bought this card about 6 months ago when I received a Nikon Coolpix 5700 as a gift. I have to say, this card has never let me down. It writes images like there's no tomorrow, and it hasn't failed me once. I haven't lost a single image, and I don't plan on it while using this card. SanDisk has done it once again. Buy from Amazon, I paid $20 more @ Staples for it 
I'm not beholden to the SanDisk brand, and did quite a bit of research, and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value. In fact, the "Ultra II" title does live up to its name, and am very happy with the performance of this product. Canon 350D takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode, and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace, even at the highest resolution. Download is speedy, too. I went for two 512MB cards instead of a single 1GB card, for redundancy (keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer), and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason. Highly recommended 
I have always been very pleased with the SanDisk products. I would highly recommend them 
I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too. I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today 
After reading reviews on every brand sold at Amazon I picked Pioneer since it was about the only brand that didn't have any complaints. I have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent. It uses DVD- disks only but since I never have used DVD+ disks that option is irrevelent to me. 
When I first got the headphones, I was frustrated...they seemed quiet...not much bass...didn't sound that great. What I've read in other reviews is very true. Having them seated in your ear properly makes ALL the difference! I don't normally like things inside my ears, but I pushed it in farther and made them seat right...and now...VERY nice. Not as loud as my other pairs of headphones...but they don't need to be. They also cut out like 25-35db of outside noise...which means you don't need as much volume. I've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though I wasn't listening to music at the time. I hope you enjoy them as I do 
Great sound quality, although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt. I recommend keeping the setting on "Bass" because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak. Prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear. The case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of effort/time it takes to get them properly in there. Other than those minor issues, its great...I prefer these over any sony/ipod/or creative earbuds. 
One thing you will read in reviews when people first use the IM716 headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running. Had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are NOT reccomended to use while running, bycycling or driving a car. I use them for long airplane flights, long walks between classes and relaxing at home, and these headphones are fantastic. Once you get it situated in your ear correctly, it takes a few tries to figure it out, you won't want to take them off. They are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible; this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format. If all of your music is encoded in .mp3 at 128kbs you arn't doing yourself justice. I have some songs in apple losses and some in ACC 192kbs (w/ vbr) and I am very happy with the sound quality. The clip, located about 6-8 inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla, Bass and High Definition. The Bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly (for those who complain that the earphones aren't loud enough) and the High Definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them. They are worth MUCH more than the 67.00 I paid for them 
These earphones are great quality. The sound is good and they fit comfortably in the ear once you get used to them. Two minuses make them only 4 out of 5 stars: first, the customer support is weak. There is supposed to be a website for the product for customer support and replacement parts, but Altec Lansing his it linked to a seemingly unrelated product; second, the volume control is a little heavy unless you have somewhere to clip it to (this might be a problem for runners) 
I purchased these headphones because I needed isolation from noise and these did the trick. The sound quality is great and the quality of the headphones themselves is first rate. The noise isolation is good for work, planes, anywhere the noise level is too high. Irecommend them for the price 
First,these phones are great but I want them in black.Now if you don't get a good ear seal they will sound horrible.The treble is silky,the mids are natural and the bass is tight,well defined and deep.I should know bass,I'm a bass player of 40 years and it's like being at a live show.Amazon sells these for $73 with nextday shipping.Get yours NOW.They take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price,it's the best deal out there.The sound quality is amazing.My sony 71s are history.Enjoy from Bassin J. 
This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in "hi-fi" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion. The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening. 
I had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since I work in a loud environment. I had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews weren't favorable. I was nervous. However, I bought these because of the name Altec Lansing has in audio. I was shocked when I first listened to them. I had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable. But wow! The clarity of these phones are incredible. No matter what others said about these, I found the bass to be tight, but not booming. If someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs, then they need to stay away from headphones period. If you are searching for a pair of IEMs, then if I were you, I would seriously consider this pair. Just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way, which I never really found that to be an issue. I don't really understand what others were doing wrong with that. If you bought these, I highly recommend it, you would not be sorry. I am thouroughly impressed with mine 
Grossly over-priced and useless - Sony's $10 headphones sounded just as good. The headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best 
This product works well. You can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders. Theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside. I can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient 
I was so excited to get this for my iPod. I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy. There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit. If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box. 
great produce. much more conveinient when you have multilpe riders in the car so that they can share 
After I bought my iPod a charger, a tape adapter, an FM broadcaster, a case, a running wheel, and a water bottle, I decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car. These little Belkin numbers are quite nifty. They hold the iPod in a nice position in my cupholder such that I can glance down at it instead of picking it up when I need to review the playlists/switch songs. Overall a nifty product - now even better that it's a little cheaper. 
With a price here on Amazon far better than some of the brick-and-mortar stores, this was an easy purchase to make. My car has unusually large cupholders yet, by simply flipping the base of the TuneDok over, I still managed to get a tight fit with no wobbling for my 3G iPod 
If your iPod has a protective cover (e.g. skin, casing, etc.), then the iPod will not fit in the holder of this kit. Otherwise, you can fit a bare (uncovered) iPod on it well. * The kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes, including adjustable cupholders. * The holder swivels, so you can have your iPod facing straight up or at various angles. * The opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the iPod. * The holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the iPod. It actually holds the iPod well. 
Other reviews mention three cup sizes. More specifically, there are *two* cupholder inserts (small and large), a special bottom attachment (for either of those) to be used in adjustably-sized cupholders, plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability. That makes (at least) six possible combinations, enough to fit any need. And, yes, the holder tilts (and the cupholder insert swivels) to give you the best reading angle. But it doesnt tilt too loosely - you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs; it's even a bit bounce-tolerant, allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt. Lastly, the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down, with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom (now top) of the insert, making a very nice desk stand for when I'm not in the car 
This item is very useful for my car because it doesn't have any unocuppied space near to the cigarette lighter socket. I find it very useful 
I purchased this to use in my LG VX8100 mobile phone. I have used it for MP3's and has been working fine. I initially had some problems with playing the MP3's but found that Verizon had the MP3 setting turned off on the phone. Once I corrected this, the Mini SD has been working fine. Only once I had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the LG not the Mini SD card. No problems since 
Must say that the item was better than I expected. Thanks to the seller and will buy again!!! 
I purchased the Mini SD 512 MB flash memory card for my LG 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone. It was easy to install and I could use it right away. Also it came with an adapter for the larger SD, so I can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if I so desired 
It work very good and I have found nothing wrong with it 
This expansion is great, now I have over 120 songs loaded in my phone. Great Media player 
If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more. This device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight. No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time. Looks aside, what does it do? It diffuses your flash's light so you get a softer and more spread-out look to your flash. No more pictures looking like you're shining a spotlight on people. This has a more "natural soft light" look to it. I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room. The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output. You may have to dial up your exposure (meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage). The tradeoff is irritating sometimes, but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos. 
This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed. The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect. PROS: Inexpensive solution for better flash photography. A quality product that works. CONS: Reduces the amount of light cast upon subject (should be expected with these types of products) 
I am probably one of the most musically/sound impared people on the planet. I rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards. I only notice substantial jumps in sound technology. I am very reserved about getting soundcards, as I dont think I ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound. I have gone from a adlib, to a SB, to SB16, to Audigy LS and now to this card. That being said, this is probably the last card I will even pick up or need. The sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards, and is amazing clear. I love the front panel for adding my headphones if I need them. I couldnt be happier with the price I paid or the product itself. Amazing buy. I cant say enough good things. I dont speak geek about the improvements, its like art.. you know what you like, and I love this card 
Everything I have tried to do with the sound card has been easy to do. Great sound, great hardware and good software. 
I have had the X-Fi Platinum for about one month. I upgraded from Soundblaster 5.1, a big upgrade. I have an Asus Motherboard, AMD processor and NVidia video and have not had any problems at all. I got the card to record vinyl to CD. I have about 500 albums. The advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point. I have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine. The recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects. I have put recordings from the records on my mp3 and burned cd's. Better sound than a casette tape and I've just scratched the surface with the software features. I have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it. All I need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features. The card is expensive but worth it, particularly if you have a specific use for it. Take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available, you deserve it. 
First off, not a perfect product far from infact, takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions arn't really clear. I had the Audigy 2 ZS before this sound card and it was a simple install card, install drivers and your good to go; huge improvement over the onboard AC97. This was the first problem, the fact that I had drivers on my system from a previous Sound Blaster card, had to sweep them from my system. my next problem was that the X-Fi drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards, but nothing that updates from there website won't fix (the original drivers must be installed first). Now why would I give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5, the sound is incredible. If the Audigy was step up from the onboard, then the X-Fi is a giant leap. Great for games and movies 
Hardware was A breeze to install.took about 20 minuets including the bay.Same for the software, no problems.Sound Quality is much improved over my old live card.In battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 2.4/radeon 9700 pro/512.Before I would freeze framing during start in rooms, and during game play in intense situations.Now with the X-Fi I have none of that, and the game runs much smoother overall. Dvd movies sound much improved. Music is also much improved. The only problem Ive had burning expanded mp3's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far. Software interface is also A bit lack luster, but is functional. Card is worth the price, hopefully upgrades will improve interface. 
The last soundblaster I had used was a soundblaster Live a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been relying on onboard sound on Nforce based motherboards. Sound quality was okay, but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs. I decided to upgrade to the X-fi when I started to have sound dropouts while playing Oblivion. Sound quality from the X-Fi is great, especially with headphones. I'm only using the Drive bay I/O panel for the headphone jack, but the price of the Platinum version wasn't much more than just the basic card, so it was money well spent. If I had this set up as a media center PC, the remote control functions would make this an even better deal. A few notes: -I had no problems installing this on an NForce4 based motherboard (Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe) -The I/O drive bay only comes in black. If you still have a tan case you're out of luck -There is a digital SPDIF output available on the back of the card. It's a mini 1/8" jack, and unfortunately no adapter to RCA jack is included 
I've been a Turtle Beach lover because I'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but can't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio. The quality Turtle Beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value. Been using Santa Cruz for years and it runs great. After upgrading CPU/Motherboard and to Z-5500, found the Santa Cruz seems to be lagging, usually about 3-5 glitches (sudden stop of sound) during mp3 playback. It might be my system's problem but anyway upgrade to Montego DDL fixed the problem. Used optical output on Montego DDL and it sounds good enough to me. But Montego DDL has a microphone problem (too low volume) that I can't live with. So I tried X-Fi, only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality. When I put it with Z-5500, I can't believe the quality it delivers. I'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell. Some people complain about no optical output on XtremeMusic and no DDL on the whole X-Fi line. But you really don't need to. Man, the quality from 3 stereo cables at X-Fi is way better than optical output from Montego. This is when I reallized that for audio products, you need listening to compare, instead of looking (the spec) to compare. XtremeMusic should be good for most people but I still bought Platinum version for future proof anyway. In my value, not quality, oriented mind, I still vote for Creative this time. Creative beats Turtle Beach this time. Beats it really hard. Of course, the microphone is fixed too 
All I can say is that they are good sleeves and they are nice to have to protect CD's/DVD's 
I thought this would be a great buy, but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy. Screw that 
Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves! The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. I agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another. They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room. Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases. 
I purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at Circuit City without first looking at the price. I was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax. I purchased the same sleeves at Walmart later the same day for 2.99. Ciruit City has great prices on many things (particularly electronics) but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced. (Same is true of many items at Office Max). I am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves (when purchased from Walmart or a simlar discounter at least) and they get the job done. These sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the open-ended sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in. These sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected 
These are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds. Can't say anything else about them - except this - I noticed when I opened the box they came in 'my' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band. It did not really affect them adversely, but just be aware that yours may come this way also 
The 50 pack are all white, and the window in the front is a useful feature - lets you see what's on there without resorting to opening the envelope. The tab on the back helps keep the disc from falling out - a nice touch 
What's to say? They're paper sleeves for CD's .. 
I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase. However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check. I was astonished. I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this. With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item. If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item. In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks! I cancelled the contract immediately. It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract. I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss. But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice. 
I paid for it and got an e-mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation. Called the 1800#. It's been a month. If it's this hard to get the plan I wonder how it will be if I need to replace my product 
This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers 
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG! Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't). Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 player 
Great battery life, easy to use, all around good. The only minus is the dependency on ITunes 
I bought this as a gift and the person loved it. Great deal for the money 
It's conviently small, but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc, but it has HORRIBLE battery life. I'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and I have to recharge just about every other day. Other than that it's great, just be prepared to have to recharge it ALL the time 
Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use. Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition. Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good. 
Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it 
This iPod was great while I could use it. Then my wife took it and now I only see it when she needs me to recharge it!! I guess it is safe to say that she likes it too!! 
Very happy with the Nano. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly. She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening! Good buy, good product, good amazon! 
This is a TV card I used to replace my aged Lifeview FlyVideo98FM card, so I could watch/record (Trinidad Tobago) games from TV during the world cup in June '06. The TV quality is the best I ever seen from a TV card to date. Give that it is an ATI based card, this is really good stuff. Unfortunately, the software package has let me down. The card came Bundled with Cyberlink PowerCinema. In day to day usage of my computer, I like to have the FM Radio function on. With the old card and 3rd party FM Radio software, there was no issues at all... With this new card, I often can't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering - this on a computer with 1GB RAM and 2 hard drives! I definitely blame the software for this. If the sticking becomes too much then the Radio stops altogether. I'm forced to close and re-open Power Cinema to listen to Radio again. TV is at least stable while doing other stuff, but you can't shrink Powercinema down to a 320x240 window. also there is a 2 second lag between TV and computer watching the same TV station. This never occured with the old card. Intervideo's WinDVR used with this card had no such issue. It's a pity I don't have XP Media Center Edition (XP Pro I have) to compare XP's Media Center software with Cyberlink's.. Somehow I think Media Center will perform better. WinDVR works better too, barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card. PowerCinema works, but it's not very intuitive. The software is written for the novice user with NO advanced options at all. When recording, you do not know exactly what quality you're using outside of "good", "better" or "best". You can't even change the default recording folder! I am sure that this occurs with other brands of Theatre 550 Pro cards, not just MSI's version. As a side note, the remote that comes with the card works well. In conclusion, It's a card worth getting if you can deal with PowerCinema's Issues, or find a better program to use with the card. 
Just finished burning through my first box of these and they are terrific. Not one was a dud. I always trust all Khypermedia Blank disks cause I have never had a problem with them. Don't hesitate to buy yourself a box of these to use for your own project because they will last you forever. Great bargain for a great produc 
I own many Lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance. However, I must add that LEXAR (USA) provides EXCELLENT service. I live in Cape Town, South Africa..... whilst I was formatting one of my LEXAR cards in my Nikon D70, I terminated the formatting halfway (accidentally).... card was damaged..... sent card to LEXAR USA after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days I had a brand new card couried to me by LEXAR..... no questions asked.... This is outstanding service!!! Well done Lexar.....Exceeded expectations 
Fast read/write times are a must for me. I am pleased so far with the card 
awesome product. fast data collection, and holds about 450 photos. i would purchase again 
Lexar Compact Flash Cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals. The "WA" (write-acceleration) feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition. Excellent return on investment! A MUST buy. ~"O 
When I bought my camera, the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package. It was very quick--far faster than any of the 512MB cards I had on hand, even those that were of the previous generation of "professional" Lexar cards. My camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card, to the point that I can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly. My only complaint is in the card's reliability. After about a month of medium-load use (about 1000 photos taken), the card ceased functioning while within the camera. Neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers (including the PC Card slot on my laptop with a CF adapter). The image "rescue" software provided by Lexar on the card was of no use, either. Lexar replaced the card, which has worked fine ever since. However, I purchased a second one, which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken. Again, the included ImageRescue software failed to help--it found errors but could not do anything about them--but a commercial image recovery tool I purchased was able to read, then reformat, the card, and it has worked reliably since 
I purchased the Lexar 1GB 80x Pro CF card for use with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT 8 mega pixel DSLR camera. I also have a SanDisk 1GB CF card which I also use with the DSLR. Of the two cards the Lexar is far and away the fastest in recording reading, I can take multiple shots at the camera's highest resolution (8 Mega Pixels)yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more. There are also no compatibility problems. To be fair to the Sandisk, it's an older model I purchased a few years ago for a MP3 player, however I now use it only as a backup to the Lexar. I plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future 
I just purchased the Canon 20D and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities. Plenty of picture room and I plan to purchase a 2GB prior to my trip to IRELAND. Price wise I did great and the turnaround time was excellent. This card was ranked No 1# in two seperate on line test so I was very sold prior to my purchase. 
If you find that they UPS is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up, there's something wrong with your configuration. The UPS is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer BIOS to restart the computer. This happens only after the UPS has sent a shutdown signal to the computer. You should not power on the computer until the UPS is done with its power up procedure. If you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after AC power is back, you should set your computer BIOS to Power On when AC power is restored. Since, while the computer is off, it doesn't know when the power comes back on, when the UPS cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on 
I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005. I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker. Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long. Only load was computer, monitor, and router). At any rate, the shut down was successful. But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so. Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here 
Most people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works. I tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage. I set it to shutdown Windows after 1 minute. Only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it. After power was cut, it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down. Then I restored power to the UPS. AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted. That is unacceptable. A UPS should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it. 
I would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime. Under a 200W load it only lasted 3 minutes while the Back-UPS ES 500 lasted almost 12 minutes. The ES 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime. In my opinion this UPS is only good for very small loads (less than the average computer) 
The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit. This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time. I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers. You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead. You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit) 
I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products. My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC. NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs). I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs. I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless 
I bought 5 of these for the computers in the house. I would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all I need is about 30 seconds of power. I noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on... To my understanding this unit detects (dirty power) and when it detects it, it will then stop accepting ac power. I think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up 
If you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS. They denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage (even though the modem wasn't hurt?) 
Designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes Delorme No support!!!!!!!!! 
I have had this for about 2 years and I travel about 100 days a year by car. I have it hooked up to my laptop, which is on the passanger seat. It has never left me down. In fact I would be lost without it, literly. I tracks where I go anywhere in the US with the existing software. Nothing else to buy !!! It pinpoints where I am at anytime. It's GREAT. If you travel a lot like me via car, and have a laptop, a VERY GOOD, AND LOGICAL PURCHASE 
I have an earlier version of this program and the antenna. It works well in the car with my laptop. I did not have the trouble others had with service. I ordered their latest version of their 3_D Topo map program. It was scheduled to be shipped in late March, 2001. I had an immediate need for the program and called them. I talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to. I asked for a Beta version to use until the new version was released. In less than a week I received the full version (not the Beta version). You can't get better service. Every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily 
fast and reliable..well worth the mone 
Perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera. I used my camera with a SanDisk Pro Duo (the blue one...) and while most times it was fine, when I needed to take pictures in quick succession - it let me down. The Ultra II is noticably faster. You will not regret buying this 
Ultra II gives very good speed to make sure your camera isn't waiting on memory. 
I've had this product for over a year and use it with my Nikon D50. It has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments, example: blowing beach sand, salt water mists, and in high heat and humidity.I bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her Canon SD600. Would buy this brand again 
The Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digitial Ultra II (SDSDH-512-901) sent to me was not the item I ordered. I returned the item, unopened 
This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii. Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD 
It's the fastest and most realiable SD card I ever used. I heard SanDisk has released a newer one that's even faster, but this one is all I need. I bought two 512MB cards to be used with a digital camera (Nikon D50) and never lost anything 
I can only say positive things about this memory card. It does a fabulous job for my 7.1 mega-pixel digital camera. Anyone who is in the market for a fast memory card with lots of storage this is the one I recommend. 
I have several Sandisk products USB Compact Flash and SD, have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days (10MB 15MB cards) Have allways found them to work great and a good value (dollar cost) for the quality. The new ultra II SD card is my second SD, also have a 256MB card (also Sandisk not ultra however) These cards work well and keep on going like the Duracell Bunny! There are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality 
There's a review here where someone takes their COMPUTER and analyzes the performance of the card. Unfortunately, most of the time what matters is how the card works with your CAMERA. A camera generally doesn't move data as fast as a computer, and it has to process it first - so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images (or other files) to your hard drive. If that matters to you, great. For the rest of you, especially camera users, here's the real story: - You need a faster than standard card if you plan to use 30fps 640x480 video. It's also a good idea with high resolution cameras, if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images. - But ... I just bought a different 512MB SD card for $10 after rebate. It's hard to beat that price / performance ratio if you're just storing photographs. Sure, video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year, but other than that, regular speed cards work fine for many uses. Always buy what's right for your needs. And, if the price differences are small, go with the faster card. There are promotions every week on various memory cards, look for one if you have time. Those can make higher speed cards a good value, though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well 
I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on. Op/Tech came up with the solution! All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go. Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway. Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots. It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used 
I am still awaiting resolution of a problem I have with these drives. In writing DVDs I get verification errors. This proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure. The drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the IDE bus, but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire 
This is an excellent cd burner. I have purchased so many and all of them are great. I have no complaints and I feel that this product is of the best quality, long lasting and very durable. When I build computers for my customers I always purchase this burner. 
This is my first DVD Burner and the first time I used one of Amazons merchants. I had some concerns about ordering, but everything went very smoothly. Its a good way of purchasing a bargain and I'm very happy with the Sony DVD Burner 
I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true. My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster. One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me. I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none. 
This DVD burner has exceeded my expectations. Additionally the price was right including a rebate offer with my effective price lower than some no-name brands 
also import a cd , money down the drai 
Amazon service was fast. Drive installed easily and is working well after 3 weeks 
The drive arrived at the end of December, was quick to get up and running, and worked fine until yesterday. Then it got the machine equivalent of "lockjaw" and I've been unable to get the tray to release. So, it's a good drive while it operates, but I'll probably make sure I pay for at least a 1-year warranty on my next purchase. As far as my recommendation goes, it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one's drive fails. Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I'd have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage. Computer hardware is never 100% reliable, but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year 
The drive works great. It was a bit difficult to install in my Sony computer as the two faceplates that came with the unit were different than the ones on my computer case--seems like Sony could pay attention to a bit more standardization on such simple things. Service from Amazon was great as expected 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

definitely recommend this memory card, download time is great . . 
This card is lightning fast. I am using it with my Canon SD700 and works great. Only drawback is that it is slightly expensive, but quality never comes cheap. : 
I recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through Amazon. It did NOT have the notch at the bottom (as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake), so I phoned SanDisk and was informed, based on the serial number, that the card IS authentic. So apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern 
I am happy to have several Sandisk products, and all of them are excellent. 
The SanDisk SDSDH-1024-901 is absoultely worth the extra money if you love to take many pictures without worrying about how many pictures are left for you to take. It is great to use with mini-videos if your camera has this feature 
This memory card is great - great quality and allows my 6 mp camera to take TONS of pictures. I highly recommend this product 
I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption. I've been tempted to buy another one. 
It's a memory card and it works! I have never had a problem with any memory card I have owned including this one. I was told SanDisk was a good brand and so far (5th memory card of theirs I have owned) they have all been reliable 
This card allows me to store 330 pictures at the highest resolution and the lowest compression. If you want less resolution and/or more compression, you can store over 1,000 pictures on this one card. The other big advantage is the very fast transfer times to and from my PC 
This flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months. I used Viking's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response. They offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed, they gave me an RMA to ship it back for a replacement. I had a new one within a week, no hassle, no fees (other than the $1.50 to mail it back to them). I never expected such great customer service. The new drive is working fine, so hopefully that was just a bad batch 
I never even traveled with it. It just stopped working completely making me lose data. NEVER AGAIN I'll buy anything from this company. This drive is a piece of rubbish! 
This USB Flash Memory Drive works exactly as described, and I'm glad I bought it. I didn't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use. My laptop has two USB ports, one directly under the other. This device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second USB device to the other port at the same time. I've given up on the rebate. It's been nearly 5 months, and follow-ups have not helped 
the USB flash frive is super easy to use and and it so small to cary anywhere. I use it for presentations and to load other computers that I'm working with. I would recommend it for not only the great price but the size and value. 
It works sweet it saves my from dragging around my laptop 
nice simple design, easy to use, worked great for me so far 
The cheapest option I found at the time but an excelent pen drive. Small and with a good style 
It works great! I really like it. There is one small problem though. The lid is REALLY hard to take off! I've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little, but not much. There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it. I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion 
When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before. The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home. After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods. In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair! What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable. I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular Memorex product 
I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are. However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks. [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.] I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it. If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away. My main complaint is that I can't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid. I hate to have to pay $7-$8 for stuff I don't need. [My collection is now at over 1800 different DVDs, so I have some experience with cleaning them. 
I had a DVD that was scratched during shipping. One repair kit did nothing to help it. I considered using the Skip Dr., but I never cared for what it did to the disks. My church's Media Center uses the Optifix system, so I decided to try it, too. The scratch was gone, and the DVD plays with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way; some scratches cannot be repaired at all. I just know that it worked great for me 
I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability. It's going back in the morning. This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches. I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc. For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine 
I'd had quite a few previously viwed DVDs that had scratches. As a result, my DVD player would freeze. This product fixed a couple of DVDs for me. As far as the haze, you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of Optrix afterwards. I stopped buying DVDs new unless I can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin 
Nice package for the beginning guitarist. Everything you need to start playing right out of the box. Guitar is well made and has a nice sound. Only problem was I had to change the strings, as they were tarnished and would not hold their tune. Good value for the mone 
It is a compact flash reader/writer and it does exactly that. So I am happy with it 
I use this little device with my Apple Powerbook to transfer photos taken with Canon digital cameras. Mac OS X recognizes the unit with no additional drivers required, and it works great. Much more convenient than attaching the camera itself to the computer every time 
I bought this becuase downloading pictures from my Digital Rebel XT Camera took forever and a day to complete. Using this drive only took about a minute to download 2 Gigs of pictures! You don't need the CD if you have windows XP. 
Works well with or without software installed. Good for home use and school or traveling. 
i have a card reader slot in my computer, but i purchased this to keep in my camera bag just in case i want to download to a computer that doesn't. it works great, but my only complaint is that it's a little bulky. other than that it's a great card reader 
This SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMate USB 2.0 Reader/Writer is a neat little device. I just pull the Compact Flash card out of my camera, stick it in the ImageMate, plug the USB cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a camera/computer transfer or worry about draining the camera's battery. I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing. I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it. The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable 
I spent $10 on a MediaGrear keychain CF card reader first. That reader is usable, but it is hard to pull my CF card out. I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card. When I plug the reader into my computer, it works immediately, no need to install any driver if you don't need to use that transfer button. 
From appearances and description, this appears to be identical to my SDDR-92 (no A15) except for the shape of the button. This SanDisk is an excellent unit - compact and reasonably slim, with a detachable USB cord. It is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case (unlike my Dazzle which is fine for a desk top, but awkwardly shaped for compact storage). The unit is reliable and fast, and, unlike the 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters, this unit only uses one hard-drive letter. It supports reading, writing, deleting, etc., and works with either USB 2.0 or USB 1.1. If you do not care about the button software, this unit installs plug-n-play, without needing a driver CD (at least on Win 2000 and XP). It simply appears as a removable hard-drive letter in Explorer. I did not install the button software because I am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer. I would rather be in full, manual control of how and when things happen, and where files are put. I think that this is a 5-star unit, but I downgrade my own unit to 4 1/2 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions. In both the instructions, and on a sticky label on the unit (which I still have not been able to fully remove), it proclaims that you MUST install the button software before connecting the unit. I ignored that warning, and the unit worked fine without any installation needed. One of the important requirements in a card reader is portability. Since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer, the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the USB port. The SanDisk SDDR-92 meets this requirement, although it proclaims not to. This is a good choice for a CompactFlash Reader/Writer. 
This controller is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is it wireless, but it corrects my only gripe about the Microsoft S-Controller: I'm 6'3", and have fairly large hands. I love the layout of the S-Controller, but the "arms" are too short for my hands. This leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions, and ends runs in Forza and Call of Duty long before I'm ready to quit. The Logitech controller's arms can't honestly be more than a half-inch longer than the S-Controller's, but it makes a world of difference. I highly recommend this controller not only for it's fantastic wireless performance, but for actually being *more* comfortable than the S-Controller. Another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a memcard/headset slot, and it's a valid complaint. I found the perfect solution in the Logitech Wireless Headset, which can be had here for $20. It works great, and it should be noted that Microsoft still wants $30 for the standard wired headset, which comes with an incredibly-weak clip for the boom mic. All in all, this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the Xbox. Pair it up with the wireless headset from Logitech, and you have a completely wireless control/chat setup for $50 a pop. You honestly can't do better, for any amount of money 
I thought when I up graded to the plasma things couldn't get any better I was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top I love this thin 
I bought this Controller at Walmat for around 32.00 worth the money no lag whatsoever buy this Controller Le 
The controller is exactly like the Microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the T.V. and not having a cord in the way. The controller works perfect 
Wireless is the way to go! When I put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place... Singular and clean looking this Sweet little controller is, IMO, another triumph by Logitech! Though a little smaller than the S-type, it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance. I got mine used and, once again, put old batteries in it(takes 2)...even four months later, I am just now getting the low battery light flashing... Still Vibrates Still Responds Acurately And the analog sensitivity is better than the wired. Get it, get it... GET IT!! 
I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff. I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally. 
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up. 
I love this controller. I have small hands for an adult, and the pad fits me well. I like the shape better than even the now-standard Controller S shape. I have no problems with delay or drift. I haven't used the D-pad, but the thumbsticks and buttons work great, though I'm not a terribly heavy user. This pad works better than either the Pelican Eclipse or Soul that I own. My Madcatz Lynx is better, but way too big for my hands. I like the feel of the plastic. The only thing I would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top, though I've never had a problem with grip 
I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first. 
I use a laptop since I am always on the go. I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time. I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop. It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great, but it really doesn't do much, if anything at all. I think the idea of the cooling pad is great, but not effective 
GREAT ITEM, POWERED OFF LAPTOP ITS FANS WORK QUIETLY TO KEEP LAPTOP COOL. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY US YOUR LAP, WITHOUT FEAR OF OVERHEATING YOUR COMPUTER. AN INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION TO PREVENTING COSTLY REPAIRS. WISH I'D PURCHASED EARLIER AS I ALREADY FRIED MY CD/DVD DRIVE AND HAD TO REPLACE THEM. GOOD PRODUCT TARGUS 
Arrived on time and in excellant condition. It works very well, my laptop is much more comfortable to use 
You're money is better spent on another product. It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made. A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged. I had one fan made a scraping noise. The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in. 
I like it. It moves the air out the back pretty fast. Keeps my legs from melting with my HP shooting all the air down. Now I can actually work in longer stretches because I don't have to take time to air out my lap 
really like the chill pad. Keeps my laptop cool!! does its job and i would recomend it to anyone. Lizz 
I have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap, bought the Chill Pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down. It would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable 
This product is cheaply made and noisy. The USB power cable developed a problem after 30 days. Don't get ripped off. Avoid this unreliable product 
This technically works well. I am finding learning to use it difficult. I really wish I had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one!!!!! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger 
I love this Tablet, It's just like working with the real thing with out all that mess, just got to get used to it, I never thought I woulde use the modern art tech but I gave it a chance and I love it. 
I love this tablet! I get the functionality of a tablet computer on my little thin Sony. I almost bought a tablet notebook, but it was so heavy. I have the best of both worlds now! 
Before purchasing this Wacom, I did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation. I have no complaints. I can't complain about the size because I knew what 4" X 5" amounted to before I bought it. The clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to, but what doesn't? Like the title says, it's just what I was hoping for 
This is a wonderful item. I upgraded my tablet and it is amazing! I had fast shipment, product was in great shape, and I love it. Thanks! 
If you do a lot of photo retouching, the Graphire4 will give you a lot more control than a mouse. The pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking. The lighter you press, the less dense the mask is. It allows you to "paint" in the correction/effect. The absolute mode (location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you touch/move the pen) of the pen takes a little while to get used to and I still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse. But after a minute or so of using it, it comes pretty easily. I think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet. It's fun to use too 
I was considering purchasing a tablet and Wacom was consistantly recommended. I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line). I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong. Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes. It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop). The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard). Other than that, its an amazing product 
I'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuaI, and have owned several previous models of Wacom tablet. For the life of me, I just couldn't get the Graphire4 working on my Mac at all. The installer crashed (Kernal panic!) my otherwise rock solid Tiger installation. Downloading the latest driver from Wacom's web site was only marginally useful; the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how I adjusted the control panel, and even moderately fast motion caused it to "submarine" from one side of the screen to the other. Wacom's sparse FAQ suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit, and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away. It didn't work, and besides, I have no plans use the tablet from across the room. Phone support was no better: Wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff July 3rd off! Too bad, it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it. Looks like my trusty workhorse Intuos2 tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service, if this is the level to which Wacom's legendary tech support has fallen. 
I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone. I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future. 
Great value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product. 
This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price! 
This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home. It's a great card at a very good price 
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures. When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology. I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos. I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow. Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy. Hope this is some hel 
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500. At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop. After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb. I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update. Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first 
Product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it. I am using it in an HP M425 5 megapixel digital camera. It will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound 
This adaptor is great, especially for the price. Installation was as easy as it gets, right out of the box. I had it up and running through a WEP-enabled local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes. It locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection. Both FrontPage and ClieMail ran fine. Speed is maybe 80% of what I get on my laptop running a 333 MHz. Celeron and a PC card 802.11b adaptor. Just be sure your PDA is on the (small) list of supported devices. Negatives: it's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world. I wouldn't leave it in the Clie when not in use and I sure wouldn't want to drop it on the floor. It does chew through the battery, but not any more than the backlight. I did a test with my UX40, with the backlight set at minimum (ie. not off entirely) and using CliePet's UnderClock app to slow it down to 96 MHz. This is a good combination of power saving and usability. Then I got on the net and loaded pages non-stop. Starting from a fully charged battery, it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm. I was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that. I consider that perfectly acceptable. With an EB40 extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it. Overall, a great add-on for a fraction of the price of a UX50 
Works like a charm, the Wi-Fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! You can get details of the connection i.e. connection strength, AP name and etc. Worth every penny 
This item gives wireless capability to Clie users, and it's the only option if you dont have a wireless integrated handheld. It is compatible with the models PEG-TJ27, PEG-TJ35, PEG-TJ25, PEG-UX40, PEG-TG50, PEG-NZ90, PEG-NX70V, and PEG-NX60. The WLAN card works great and I recomend this for every Clie user who wants to go wireless (... 
I bought this for my digital camera because my other batteries didn't last very long. These work great and last for a long time. 
It tells you what it is doing. Some communication is better than none 
Voltage input can be either 110VAC or 220VAC, which is very important in other countries. Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are better than old fashioned rechargables because they do not necessarily have to be totally discharged before recharging. Charging units are compact and light 
gives me charged cells in quick time..added advantage is the world wide voltage capabilit 
I bought this to replace original Canon batteries that came with my Canon A280. This is really good and I am happy with battery life, charge time etc. The best features I like: - Short charge time - Compact cas 
We recharge batteries all the time with this charger and it does an excellent job, all the time 
I purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem. I use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far. Highly recommend this product 
This WorldWide charger is the best that i have ever used. I use this mainly for my camera. Nowadays I don't even bother to charge frequently. But a small drawback would be then can have provide AAA batteries as well in there pack so that we do not buy them individually. 
Great batteries for cameras. They charge quickly, and it's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time "just in case" 
The charger arrived with in 2 days., [ Amazon PRIME ]. I used this battery for my Canon A 530 and it works like a charm.

We had purchased a DVD recorder and within 5/6 months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor, I contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last 5/6 months. We bought this product and from the time of cleaning it has worked perfectly. I will recommend anyone having problems with their DVD player/recorder to try this first before sending the unit to the repair shop as I was about to do. 
I've not found anything from Memorex that works right, try Maxell products from Amazon, you can't find better products and the best customer service on the net. 
Can't see spending tons of money to clean a product that has been out in the market for lots of years. It works just fine, and cleans just as stated. 
I got it at very reasonable price approx 4 bucks sells for 9-10 at retail stores. Works great and nothing can beat this deal!!!! only if its free...!! ha!ha 
It is inexpensive and works. My daughters CD maching kept getting error messages. Popped this in, cleand the lens and no longer get error messages. What more can you say 
I have a Sony DVD player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time, and would still be good today if functioning. Recently however, it was seriously malfunctioning. I would put a DVD in, and it would keep spinning, but then not recognize it at all. It would recognize and play CDs, but they would skip constantly. I decided to give this a chance for $5 to see if I could recover my player. I ran it once and it seemed to skip less, but would still not recognize DVDs. I thought , maybe if I put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work. Voila!!! I couldn't believe it, DVDs were recognized and played again. So give it a try, maybe run it a few times!!! 
My DVD player was ready to be thrown out, until I saw this product on amazon. My DVD player wouldn't even load a DVD. It kept saying "please check disc". After loading this disc, my DVD player has worked perfectly ever since. Don't spent $30 on one of these "clean up discs". This one does the job 
Hi, Hey, don't run to the repair shop just yet and don't kick that DVP/DVR to the curb too soon.......help is on the way!!! My DVR was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until I fed it this Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner. WOW, it worked like magic!!! It's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day I purchased it. If you own a CDP/DVP/DVR a Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop......it certainly did in my case!!! Just my two cents. -paul 
I like the use of this product. i think it did solve solve the problem my computer cd/dvd drive was facing which was slow reading the cds... with the low price its a must for every computer owner to use this 
I purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows I couldn't wait to get my hands on one.Why wouldn't I? it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. At first it looked like a really cool product, and is, if your system is a Mac. Logitech has done a great job of selling the Nulooq to Windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on. There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product. I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech. What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users. So if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you....and I know where there is one for sale!!! 
Been waiting for the Windows version since I saw the product at PMA on Mac earlier this year. Used the Windows version from the very moment it was available. I touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great. Tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end. Adjusting brush size is the best. Bracket keys never cut it for me. I think the product does more, but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver. If you do touch up work in Photoshop all day long, this is a must have 
The NuLOOQ is an inexpensive and really fun way to fly through images in Photoshop when cloning out specks or needing to move throughout an image with lightning speed. The Pan/Zoom function is tremendous! It's a programmable tool where you can add photoshop tools and actions to the Tooldial for instant access at the mouse location, rather than moving to the menu bar all the time. This is a great time saver because you can program in redundant tasks to appear on the tool dial to be clicked in a moments notice. Changing brush size is as simple as turning the tool tuner to the appropriate brush size, in real time. I highly recommend it to speed and simplify one's workflow 
I bought a NuLOOQ when it first came out for the Mac. I've been an Illustrator Visualization Artist for 17 years now. I have an iMac at home and a PC at my full-time job. It takes a little while to break some old habbits, but once you do, and get used to the NuLOOQ device, you'll never go back! I love this smart toy! I got so hooked on it, I recently purchased one for my PC here at work. If there is anyone out there that thinks it's just for the Mac your wrong! The PC version is just as good! It's become part of my left hand and I still use my Wacom tablet all the time also! To me, this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer; cross platform. Bravo to Logitech for making another great product! Get one...I'll guarantee you'll get hooked on it 
Logitech scored a big plus with this item. The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly. The first review is really unfair. Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous. Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did. Good job on this one. I recommend it highly 
I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today. One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found 1) Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response. Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand. Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead. 2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod, but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad. 3) The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly heavy pressure to operate, at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week.... There may be a device out there that will someday "revolutionize my workflow", but this isnt it, Back it goes... 
I am a photographer whop purchased this for use in Photoshop. It exceeded my expectations, and continues to amaze me daily. I now use it for everything from my Safari Browser and iTunes to games. It is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications! It is by far the most innovative product I have ever used...and the Tooldial software it comes with is AWSOME! 
I bought the NuLOOQ product a few weeks ago with little expectation and actually with some doubts it'd do anything for me, as I'm a keyboard junkie. The product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot. But what a surprise. Just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price. The pop-up menu thing is cool. I don't use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place. I guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around, but I don't seem to use that as much. I still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around. Hey, I was skeptical about the product like anyone else, but found myself a rare surprise. Good job Logitech 
I've had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my XP machine and am now using it with my Apple Mac Mini. Works great with both Windows and Mac OS X, with no hassles. The removable stand is a nice touch, as you can pack the reader into a laptop bag or lay it horizontally if you prefer. Highly recommended 
I bought this card reader in Feb. 2004 to use with SD cards. Since then I have moved over to CF cards (Sandisk Ultra II's both 1 and 4 gig) and it has worked great every time 
I have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera. 
The Reader worked as advertised. I'm very pleased with the purchase.. 
This memory card reader worked like a charm for me. We've used both SD and Sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems 
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk. 
The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time). The DVD player completely fails to recognize them. Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue.... Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed. More Taiwanese junk. (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore) As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine... I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments 
No problem reading and burning on NEC 2500A. The media code is MCC which is highly rated in most media guides online (albeit not the best). I also burn DVDs as slow as I can unless I am in a hurry, less chance for errors that way 
I am very happy with these. They are fast and with very good qualit 
I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work. This stuff is junk. In addition, the manufacturer never sent the rebate. Don't buy anything from Velocity 
At least for my Sony DVD burner in my Powermac. Completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot 
They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up). These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used. The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK. I am going to return these package to Amazon. 
I have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters, They are burning at 8X in my NEC 2500A burner. That is pretty considering that it is advertised at 4X. Hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years 
No problems with this SanDisk. I can take about 300 pictures from my Nikon camera. Quality is perfect. 
shipping was outrageous, thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a F'n postage stamp, but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than I did for the item, could have bought it at walmart for less this way. Buyer beware, I got took 
Good price. What else can one say about a Secure Digital Card 
Excellent service from Amazon, Best quality in lowest price, I am really very happywith Amazo 
This is an excellent, reliable product. I bought 2 because of the outstanding sale price 
I love this 512mb SD card, its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a 1gig SD card too. works great with my GPS unit 
This card works great and is significantly less expensive than it is at local retail stores. As a matter of fact, I just ordered another one yesterday 
This sandisk digital card has been very useful and worked perfectly fine. Thank you 
The card performs exactly the way that I expected it to, and I have had zero issues with speed downloading images from the care to my PC 
You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue 
Overall this is a very good remote. It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled. It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems. My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up. These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices. I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again 
Easy to use, and fairly easy to set up. However, as stated in most previous reviews I read, initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use. Wish that macro creation was more detailed; for example, more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a DVD, including ejecting and closing the DVD tray. Pleased with purchase 
Best remote product I ever purchased. I have the older version of the Harmony and This newer version is 10 times better. Lipo battery last for ever and you dont need to worry about it going dead because you charge it to much 
This was a breeze to set up. Just install the software on you computer, enter the model numbers of your components. For those few items that aren't in the list, the 880 can learn from an old remote. As a very nice bonus, if you don't have the old remote, the software will try to pick a device (example : you have an RCA tv Model XYZ , if model XYZ isn't in the list, it might suggest ZxY) , and that suggestion should work. I liked how I could create a list of favorite channels, and how I could upload icons for those channels to the remote. So that it shows the icon instead of the number. Or better yet. Open the icon in paint and in the icon put the number (the channel number right in/on the icon). It looks good and works great! I love how the database for the IR codes for all the different devices can be added to by the users of the remote. I understand that no company could ever hope to have ALL of the IR codes for ALL devices ever made. To think that a company could do that would be insane. Logitech realized there is power in numbers. Let the end users help to improve things. It also allows you to leave any components on permanently, for example my TIVO box. I don't want that to turn off. It can be turned off, and as a default the Harmony 880 will turn it off (to save power). I prefer it on. And making that change was pretty simple, you just go into the preferences for the TIVO (in the harmony software), and tell it "Always leave this device on". Now when you hit the off button on the harmony remote, everything else turns off and the harmony 880 leave the TIVO on. My only complaints are these items: The buttons to the left and right of the screen are a little tough to push. I personally think they should have been a little easier to activate. Also I would have liked to have had the pause button a little more centered and more separated from the other buttons. That way it would have been easier to pause a tv show/dvd/vcr tape. And last but not least the Media and Device buttons should have been separated more from the left and right arrows that are just above those buttons. It's a little tough to hit them without thinking about what you are doing. Given to have made the improvements I have just said would require adding a little width to the remote, but the trade off would have been for the better. All in all I suggest the remote for anyone who has a number of components for their home theater. It works wonders. It might just be that I am a little to picky on my technology. 
easiest remote to program. has tremendous ability to tweek. will keep recommending to all my customers 
I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database. Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package. In any event the process was hassle free and I now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great. (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.) My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off. However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again. The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base. Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880. 
If you have basic PC skills this remote is for you. With its USB connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it. The small LCD screen is very easy to set up and you. If your to lazy to customize your remote(me), it also has a learning port. The learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one. My favorite feature is turning everything on. The button "Play DVD" turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv, additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres tv/video. The only problem that I have with this remote is the recharge base. It sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed on/off and gives off a beep. All in all this is probably the best remote ive ever had 
Great remote, does evertying I hoped and dreamed. The only downside was the set-up. Logitech went to great lenths to make the set up as simple as possible - unfortunatly that made the fine tuning of the remote a long process navigating a large number of learning steps. In the end I am very happy with the product and would suggest it to anyone - just put aside some time to get it to work exactly how you wish 
This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months. About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono. Had to send it in for repairs. After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred. Had to send it for repairs again. A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease. In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged. I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night. So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely. When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message . Resetting does not work. The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195. Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit. I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again 
I had an iPod for about a year, and had a lot of problems with it, having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired. After the third time, I sold it to a friend and invested in the iAudio instead. This is a great product, as it can record sound, play movies, radio, and play tons of file formats. I highly reccomend this product, especially over the iPod...they are crap compared to this. The only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts m4p files (songs from iTunes if you purchase music from them) as the iAudio can't read m4a or m4p. It's easy enough to get a converter, just might cost you a little more money. Outstanding use of my money though....thumbs up 
I bought this player in December 2005,since then , this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well. I have no complaint about it, because I'm extremely dependent of this player, so that means that i use it, around 5 hours in my days off,and 2 hours in a regular day.Another example of how durable this player is, because I like to exercise(running) with the music as my main powerï¿½ï¿½, therefore with the really hard to find function(anti-shock) in portable hard drives, the iaudio x5 is one the most functional PMP on the market. About the sound is just incredible clear with the right earphones.the unique complaint is about the non-sync with WMP,so I'm still waiting the right firmware... As a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products. 
I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works 
When I started looking for an mp3 player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level. The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects: -Superb sound quality, especially from something that weighs under 8 oz. (I am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable) -Rugged all metal construction and overall great feel -Simple design and intuitive joystick/buttons (I found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes; converts from the iPod may take some getting used to) -A plethera of options: mach3 bass, surround sound, pan, wallpaper, 5 band equalizer, fm radio, voice recorder, surround sound and MP enhance -The ability to play video -A 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time -Very powerful, I normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it -Priced about the same as equal or lesser mp3 players -Extremely easy program to use for transferring ANY type of file to the iAudio. It is a drag and drop system; it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music. -Everything you need is included in the box - earphones, usb 2.0 transfer cable, another cable, a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player, charger and jetshell software -Great storage space (20 GB) which can be used to store much more than mp3s There are some negative attributes to the iAudio X5 however: -The most glaring problem I had was with the in-ear headphones; they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable. They also have an assymetrical length cord. I consider myself to have average size ear canals so I imagine this is a major problem for other users. I suggest Cowon completely redesigns these. -Because the brand is widely unknown, the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews. -No place online to buy mp3s particulary for this player (however I read somewhere that there would soon be one just like iTunes.) This being my first mp3 player I am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price, because I would rather pay more for the quality. The iAudio X5 is an all around outstanding media player and I believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out. If I were to rate everything that came in the box I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones. Other than that this mp3 player is close to perfect. 
I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat. This is a quibble, however, that one can live with. Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good. 
After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod. Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's. This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on. I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon. To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely. Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line. The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook. I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending. I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least. I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those. The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod). I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port. What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too! I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market. A Satisfied Custome 
I am not going to rehash what the other comments have said. Most that mention pros and cons are accurate. Here is my addition. Joystick is not as good as the Ipod. On the other hand, the Ipod was designed by Apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a PC. I have not even installed any software to use my iAudio! I use it as a hard drive, Mp3 player, and sometimes I record radio shows to listen to later. I got the 30gb for extra storage. The iAudio seems to be quality made and doesn't scratch as bad as my son's iPod. I would buy this product if I had to do it all over again! 
This is the second G15 keyboard I've purchased, not because the first one broke, because it's such a great keyboard. Now I keep one at home, and take one with me when I go LANning. The only issue with the keyboard is the LCD is pretty useless is fast paced FPS games, otherwise it's good for keeping the clock up so one doesn't lose track of the time 
I bought this a few months back, and I use it mostly for playing WoW. PROS: Very high quality product, strong enough to endure long keyboard-smashing combat sessions. The LCD is very useful if [like me] you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game, because it allows me to control iTunes whithout alt-tabbing out of the full-screen game. Macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites, and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your in-game action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard (I use flexbar with WoW). CONS: The software needs a bit of improvement: If I put my computer to hybernate, the software seems to hang when I bring it back up, and I can't use the macro keys, so I have to reboot or kill the software's process and restart it manually. The interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability (it forces me to use the mouse a lot, and i like being able to use the keyboard). Even though the LCD offers other posibilities [like displaying available ammo], I don't use most of them, because I can get most of these values from my game's UI and I dont have to look away from the monitor to do so. Overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming. Wouldn't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming 
Overall, this keyboard is great. Here are what I like about it: 1. I can fly on this key due to it's relatively soft keys (I think there are softer keyboards, i.e. less resistance when pressing down. God, I miss my SPAR station keyboard, but can't use it with a PC :( ) 2. LCD screen has huge growth potential for other info display. 3. lighted keys (this can be a bad thing too). 4. Programmable keys, lots of them! (can be a headache to remember them too) The flaws: 1. The lighted keys uses a bright blue color, even at the dimmest setting it's still not good. Here's some physics for the designers: The human eye doesn't sense blue well in the dark, and thus the pupil stays wide open, and the blue lights can be seen as a bad glare. Same effect of having one of those expensive HID xeon headlights beaming at you. So why is this a problem on a keyboard? well, you would most likely use it in the dark with the key lights on. However, your peripheral vision will have this blinding glare, it could make some people dizzy or have some optical illusion that's not going to sit well with your eye's scan rate. Suggestion for the designer: use other less intrusive color for the LED, possibly red, orange, green. Hell, make them selectable! Blue would not be my first choice. 2. The USB plugs on this keyboard doesn't support my USB 2.0 flash drive, BAD!!!! If you are going to provide an USB port, do it right! 3. The black soft rubber surface on the edge and LCD back cover is a dust magnet. They provide some good traction when you grab them, but they also grab dust like nothing else, so you'll endup with an impossible to clean black surface. Lesson learned, don't eat snacks near the keyboard, or your keyboard will end up with lots of nice snacks for the dog to lick :D Ok, duck tape would fix that, but... I'm lazy! Other than that, it's a solid keyboard 
I've had the Logitech G15 for several months now and it has many features which I use regularly. The paint doesn't seem to wear off even if I rub or scratch at the keys. Installation was somewhat time consuming because the keyboard has drivers for each part rather than one driver for the entire thing. Pros- Lights look great Screen is easily readable Third party LCD apps are highly customizable I can use chat on Trillian and access my buddy list with the screen. (Keystrokes go directly to the screen when you hit the button for reply, then I can send it by hitting enter) I can view a winamp visualization and song title, view my playlist, change various volume controls and use standard playback functions I can view network activity Macros are easy to program The key feel is awesome compared to my old keyboard. They have a nice solid click to them, but the pressure necessary and the keystroke length are both small.  Cons- Included LCD apps are terrible and useless to me Long setup More G-Keys than you'll ever use Minimal game support LCD apps take up valuable RAM (although not much) Keyboard profiler takes up RAM and must run to maintain full functionality Invisible lettering when the lights are off Light brightness levels are pointless. The options are: Off-can't see it! 1-Visable but dim. 2-Slightly more visible but still dim. USB ports are USB 1.1 "Gaming mode switch"... I never hit the windows key while gaming even though I usually use ctrl and alt frequently. I think you'd really have to be fumbling with the keys to need that feature The wrist rest is flimsy The default LCD setting is to cycle through the APPS (which I hate) and if I don't shut down properly, the LCD profiler resets all its settings to default. The included POP3 checker doesn't have SSL, you need to get some ridiculous add on which sucks up more resources. The mail checker APP+ the SSL thing ends up being a little too resource heavy for me to appreciate. In other words, its a big pain to get Gmail working with the included checker. If you play a lot of World of Warcraft or really like to tweak your settings and streamline your interface, you might enjoy having all the macros. The screen is more useful for non-gaming purposes, so don't buy it with intent to improve your HL2 experience (since the LCD doesn't display anything for HL2 anyway). There are many 3rd party LCD apps out there and you can probably find one that will make you love the screen. Be warned, unless you use the 3rd party apps, you probably will be disappointed with the LCD's functionality. Bottom line- Recently the priced spiked up for these keyboards, I wouldn't pay the new higher price for one. This isn't the kind of item I would say that I can't live without. Its mainly a luxury, and unless you're a serious computer geek (like myself), you probably won't even know how to utilize the more advanced features. The hardware is solid and powerful if you know how to use it. The included software cd ended up in my trash can. 
Just like others have stated. The paint comes off the keys after a few months of use. You would think logitech would have made a better product. 
Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws. I called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices. All-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger 
This fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical ho-hum keyboard. The LCD screen is a nice feature (toy) but I find myself rarely using it as most apps and games don't support it. The two USB ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside USB on their towers. It is worth buying for anyone in that situation. The blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but doesn't help much in a truly dark room. The macro keys are plentiful and easy to use. All-in-all well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard, anyone needing easy access to USB ports and for anyone needing macro keys. People may also want to give the new Vista keyboard from Microsoft a look 
We bought this TV 3 months ago and don't regret it one bit. It was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition. We do not have satellite or cable (only reg. antenna) and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the "digital" signals. Again, we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to HD 
I searched far and wide and compared many tv's. It came down to the Panasonic Plasma TV vs. the Sony KDFE42A10. I went with the Sony due to price; but I'm glad I did. I can't see putting [...]in a TV. I am really pleased with the Sony; particularly the price I paid. It was so much cheaper here at Amazon.com than at the big box retail stores 
I purchased this television at a bricks-and-mortar store, on sale, for less money than the 32" LCD screen that I was considering. I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV. For comparison, I am moving from a 26" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great. My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault. I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200. My last "pro" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet. I can scoot this TV on my stand without scratching the wood surface, and when trying to center a TV which is nearly 40" wide across the front, that's a good thing 
My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it. I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well). Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves. My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me. Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite. My first impression had me rather worried. I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out. I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others. In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them. I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time. The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great. The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen. The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video. I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs. The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking. Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual. Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon. Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level. I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation. I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off. Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that. I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon. I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away. But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery. I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer. Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place. All in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner 
I got mine locally for $1100 dollars. The going rate was 1399-1599. I saw it at a competitor for $1198. So I went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another $100 off the price for HDTV installation. What a picture. I started to get turned off by sony because I had 2 32 inch CRT's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners. But I remained loyal and I'm glad I did. I was iniitally wanting a DLP by Samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away. I didn't go for the $500 dollar service contract because that's half of the price of the television. I'll take my chances on this one. Hopefully bulbs will come down too. You'll love the picture with or without HDTV. I love all the features and they're pretty intuitive. There probably won't be too many left. I think they're phasing the model out. Not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it. Sorry about the other bad reviews here 
I bought this TV in March of this year (2006) and it has worked perfectly until the Sony Techs came out and "updated" my firmware. I was not having any problems with the TV but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty. As soon as the tech left and I turned on the TV, the fan is running on "high" and is loud. This did not happen until the software was updated. I went into the functions and tried to use the High Alt function to turn the fan to low (off) but that would work. The good news is I bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed, or replaced......... Word of caution, you may consider not updating the firmware if the TV is working, and buy the extended warranty. I paid $300 for 4 years and figure I'll get at least one $250 bulb out of the deal (yes, it is covered). Otherwise, the TV is perfect 
Well, I can't give an honest review of this product because I haven't yet received it. I ordered it on June 15, and it was promised, by Amazon direct, not another seller via Amazon, between June 21 and June 23. So I'm sitting here on July 15 with no TV....... It really isn't Amazon's fault, it's the shipper, Eagle. But whatever, I'm less than satisfied with this Amazon.com transaction. I have seen the TV in stores and it looks good though.................. 
Brilliant images. Highest quality. You simply cannot beat this system for the price. Also, this particular projection TV handles the non-HDTV channels very well - not all HDTV models do this. The fact is that most channels are not available in HDTV yet, so it's nice to have a high quality TV that can deliver non-HDTV channels to you in a high quality rendering. This TV does that very well. Yes it's nothing like HDTV, but all the same they do a fine job with this model 
I was a little tentative to order the iTrip LCD because of some of the bad reviews I read. It seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item. Buyers either love it or hate it.  I was leaving for a trip and hoped the iTrip would arrive so I could use it on my drive. As luck would have it, it was in my mailbox the day before I left. I unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it.  I plugged it into my 20GB iPod photo and right off the bat thought I had trouble. It wouldn't power up, I tried plugging and unplugging, cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort, read the instructions. After plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on. This immediately explains why so many poeple complain of DOAs right out of the box.  I set the frequency to the lowest available on the FM band and presto!!! instant music. I don't live in an extremely populated area so I can't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet. Many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this. It doesn't matter how great the quality of the song is on your iPod, you are playing it over FM radio so it will never sound better than FM radio. I inherited my father's '91 Accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones AM/FM radio with a tone control(bass AND treble all rolled into one handy knob!!!) and cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers in the front doors. When I drive I like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music. The sound quality was exactly what I expected, no better and no worse. I also tested it in my wife's '01 Focus. It has a nice factory 6 speaker CD system and the sound from the iPod was just fine. The bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all. I am completely satisfied with the product. One strange thing that I noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the iTrip, the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone. If you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road. Unless there was a defective batch sent out, I don't know where all of the complaints come from. I got mine for $15 from a private seller on Amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money. Don't hesitate to buy one, it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is. If you keep these things in mind, you won't be disappointed 
it was not what i was expecting... but still ok... probably 96kbps... quality... still all right for the price... but if u want something with 320kbps quality... do not buy this product.. 
i was using the tape player for my ipod. but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter. i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency. i was very very disappointed. it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease. i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear. so i blame the transmitter. i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it. i'm glad target took it back. 
Some people seem to have had issues but I loved mine. I live in the Boston area and the iTrip always worked fine in the 88.3-88.5 range. Not fantastic sound but more than adequate. The portability is a huge plus as well - I used it for playing my iPod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling, radios at friends' houses, on and on. The iTrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable. I have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently. For the price and the convenience you can't beat this thing. The only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of iPods 
I purchased 1 of the old model when I bought my ipod. As hard as I tried I was unable to switch stations on it. "Okay" I thought, "I must have got the one bad one..." So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the "radio stations" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are "just not tuned in right" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the "station fuzz" goes away. Only a fool walks on thin ice twice - and I've done it 3 times now...Never again! Don't follow in my footsteps! Please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage 
So, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an "ipod to car" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio. 
It's goo 
I've used this to burn about 3 CDs and my husband has done a couple as well. We haven't had any problem so far 
It was a little complicated to install (but I'm not very technical) but it is very easy to use - I have been happy with it 
I bought this about 7 months ago and never had a problem with it. It take 7 minutes to burn an 80 minute cd. The program reminds you to close any other open programs before burning a disc, very easy to use. I brun cd's every single day. It is my baby!! 
It is an excellent product, easy to install, really powerful, the only minus is the burner software, if you have or you can purchase Nero or CDRWin then you can obtain the maximum performance from this unit 
I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned. Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market. The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it. Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on. On other occasions it completely locks up. The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG". The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes. There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner. I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system. First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load. To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk. If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over. Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be. On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful. I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception. Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review. Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great. It's average. Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass. The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it. But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now. I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon. 
I ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here. BIG MISTAKE. Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded "UNPLUG/PROTECT" screen came up. Now it won't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it's not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!! On top of that, even out of the box, NONE of the video inputs worked. Audio was fine, but video was dead as a doornail, right from the start. And even on top of the fact that this machine CAME broken... it sucks even when it works right! The DVDs take forever to load, and it comes with HDMI out, but NO HDMI IN! So if you're an HDMI user, I hope you have multiple HDMI inputs on your television... one for your cable box, one for this crappy system. This is a piece of junk. For the love of god, don't waste your money 
I bought this "dream system" to compliment my Samsung HL-R5087W 50" HDTV DLP television. If looks could kill these two products together win hands down. Overall I am pleased with the system for the amount of money I invested for it. Sound is decent. I feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with Monster Cables. As like many others thoughts I was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and "wireless" seemed to be the answer. Problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a WIRE. So if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because Sony has figured out how to eliminate point A to point B but point B to point C remain dreamless 
This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars 
This product is awesome....of course, it's a Sony :) What else can I say 
I started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment. A wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my TV. After searching for a while, there were only a couple options available: the Sony DAV-FX100W, a system by Panasonic that had an optional wireless option, and a wireless receiver kit made by Kenwood. After looking at reviews of all of the different options, the Sony DAV-FX100W appeared like the best choice. I'm very happy with that decision. DVDs look great on my HDTV with the 1080i upscaling feature. Be forewarned, if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive HDMI cable and your TV will need to be support it. I bought a 3ft Belkin cable (instead of Monster) and it was still over $100. DVDs also sound terrific; the surround is impressive for a wireless solution. Like any stereo, it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker, and I pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel. The subwoofer, as others have stated, is pretty powerful for a passive speaker. There could be more depth to the sound, however, it is an out of the box solution and I think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it's default sound level. Others have complained that CDs don't sound good; I disagree. I've played several CDs and I think they sound great. I also input my iPod through the Video1 audio inputs, and that sounds pretty great too. Again, like any receive, you'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking. Overall, I'm very happy with this system 
I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one. Some Dream System. The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well. After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas. I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!! And i haven't even watched a movie ye 
I purchased the Sony DAV-FX100W system over the internet. It surprisingly arrived in only a few days. Assembly and wiring instructions were done well. It looks good and matches well with my Sony HDTV. The sound quality is just fine for movies and TV programs but fair at best for listening to music on CD's or from the FM tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo. The base is not tight and kind of whoompy, although there is plenty of it. I actually had to decrease it by 3 db. The many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the "sport" which does sound like being in a stadium. Most of the time it is best in "auto" performing in the method the audio was recorded. The IR transmitter/receiver works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as AC power for the amp, a wire from the IR receive to the amp, and wires from the amp to both rear speakers. Not as clean as one might imagine from the product description. As mentioned in previous reviews, the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack. A 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with DVD's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple CD's to listen for music. I certainly would prefer my stereo for that! Over all I am satisfied with it and recommend it. It performs well for what it was intended, to reproduce sound from movies and TV. Again it is a good looking system. 
Well, I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $149.. I love mine... The sound really is great, and the price was AWESOME! I use mine for DVD's, my TV's regular sound for all TV I watch, and also as a Tuner to listen to the radio/ CD's in surround sound. Some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers... I don't know if this helps or not, but I will share- I had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and I did NOT put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit. I thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference, so if you have that whine, make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment. Mine does not make any noise on standby, or skip at all either. I am very happy with mine. 
I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar 
The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer. The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem. Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit. I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service 
This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room. Assembly takes about two minutes. The instructions are very clear. The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film. Why then do I give it one star? It skips. Like nobody's business. At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched. But then we put in new disks. No difference. When exactly does it skip? Impossible to tell. Sometimes a little. Sometimes every frame! Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad. Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip. So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back. Save your money! Buy from someone else 
Nice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality. Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it. 
I puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance. The DVD playback is fantastic - you really feel the surround sound - and the speakers work well. It can get pretty loud too. The only minor issue I have is when I'm in "TV" mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low. I've experiemented with all of the modes but can't seem to be able to get them up to the volume I would like. This is not a problem when playing a DVD or using the radio tuner, however. Set up was extremely easy and a complete "no-brainer". Great system for a great price 
this dvd system is sweet the sound system is off the hook its worth your Doller 
This home theater system is great! It was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions. Once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear. Highly recommended for the price you pay 
the item ordered performs well in what it is supposed to do 
Great item for homes lacking phone jacks. Easy to set up.Better than trying to hard wire 
Why would you want this item? Amazon is charging $50 MORE on this item than the 2nd Generation Shuffle! And, according to what I have read, THIS Shuffle isn't very derable. It doesn't even last a year! I don't know about you, but I'LL get a 2nd Generation Shuffle 
The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for. On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties 
One day it just stopped working. I got the dreaded "orange and green flashing lights of death"... the contents of the File space were un-recoverable... and I ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it. Apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that Apple likes to keep hush-hush 
Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods. 
My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing. Perhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar. 
I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05). It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird. The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music. Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty. The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one. I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me. I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano. It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner. 
The shipping was good and the product too. thanks to amazon for your commitment best regards Hecto 
This printer produces 4X6 prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab. The quality is fantastic, and the relatives were in awe. I am very very happy with the printer and the Canon S400 camera I use it with. I now have a portable print studio. Do not confuse this printer with ink jet printers. It uses dye sublimation, a completely different printing process. The result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard, not a piece of paper. You don't put ink in it, so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer. You buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from Canon. (KP-36IP, for example 
This printer was very easy to use. Just pop in the cartridge, paper, and plug in the camera. The camera has to be a certain type of Canon, but there is an available computer cable (I have not gotten it yet), to hook up other cameras. The benefit of using a Canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer, and still print out pictures. These pictures look beautiful, and the colors are true and bright. Printing couldn't be easier and fast. I was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs, press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling. It's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture. Instant gratification 
This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices 
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice 
This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
PROS Small Cute Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup. USB 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well. Runs cool. CONS Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them. The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated. Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough. Overall good value for price 
This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs). It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer. And I still have 3 more ports. And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub. It does what it says 
lovely. my pictures are so nice an clear.not like the other cards i had where the pictures came out so blurry. i would recommend this card to anyone who needs it. thanks again.cscott rvc, n 
Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last. 
I have been using this transmitter with my IPOD photo for a few days. This stuff work flawlessly and the transmission was strong enough. I tune the same radio frequency from another car and the sound still clear enough. If there was an interference, all I have to do just re-setup to the empty channel. This stuff will overpowering the other channel if available. The only drawback for me is once you plug the arm connector to the transmitter, it will hard to re-open again. It might broke the plastic construction if you are not careful. 
First off, the ipod jiggles no matter what you do, secondly, it doesn't stay straight on the power plug, it constantly tilts(the whole thing)...not worth $10 
I tried two different devices before this one, and they simply did not work satisfactorily in a big city with a very crowed FM band. DLO Transpond is excellent, I drive through Sao Paulo, Brazil which is a huge city with almost 20 million habitants and consequently many FM stations in the dial. Occasionally I need to switch station but most of the time the same works fine all day long wherever I have to drive. Mounting was simply, I use the extension arm provided to get a handy and firm location. In short, I am totally satisfied. 
The DLO transpod works perfectly with no static. I was hesitant to purchase this. I thought because it works through the radio, there would be some interference or static. Well, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. I was so pleased with this product, I purchased one for my husband, and my sister and two friends bought one too. For anyone who has an ipod, this is a must have! Another great feature is that the transpod charges your ipod while you are listening to it. I have NEVER needed to charge my ipod. You can set this up any way you want it in your vehicle. It takes up very little space. This product is definitely money well spent, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an ipod 
I bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp. The audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations. No lag while playing my Playstation 2 console... The only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press "SOURCE" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it's annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it's a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space 
Application is dual input from cable TV input and analog PC input, used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation. 1) Audio output stops intermittently a few times a week, requiring power off/on to regain audio. 2) There appears to be no way to disable unused source modes. To switch from computer input to TV input requires one push of the Source button...... but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes - as the TV cycles thru AV, S-Video, Component modes, and finally back to PC mode. A weak design - the unit should recognize which input is enabled - it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes. This is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a TV/PC monitor. Picture quality is acceptable for the application, which is primarily watching news channels while working at PC, or displaying dual PC applications 
First, I would buy it again if I needed to. This 15" takes up less space on the kitchen counter, i.e., speakers are on the bottom. Second, picture and sound are excellent, i.e, clear. I would not buy this item if I wanted a true VESA mount to monitor configuration. The stand, not the monitor, has the screw holes for the VESA wall mount. Not enough or clear info in the description. However, it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall. If you need counter space then buy something else. 
I was very surprised at how good the color is on this TV. I've has it for a year and love it and many friends have bought one and liked it as well. It's a great price for a LCD TV. 
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price 
While I am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me, I am a little disappointed. I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace). Bose failed me once, shame on them. They failed me twice, shame on me. I'm gonna go with something else 
For those who expect true 5.1 Dolby Surround out of the Bose 3-2-1 system, please look elsewhere. This unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area. You need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised. I bought this system probably a month or two after it came out, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it's still going strong. I owned an apartment and wasn't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand, so this system fit the bill quite nicely. Did I know I wasn't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience? Of course I did. The big drawback to this system is really the lack of Component Video. I only wish it had Component Video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there I was kicking myself... and still kicking myself. For those who complain that it doesn't play all videos, I will say this. I have also had issues with it not playing videos. What I discovered was that it wasn't the DVD's but the transfers or the video type. VCD has issues, SVCD mostly plays and of course every commercial DVD I have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the DVD itself, like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface. Bottom line is that when I keep my DVD's clean, my Bose system is friendly. If you've got bootleg DVD's, don't expect them to play in your Bose DVD, they probably won't work. More to the point, they probably shouldn't work becuase you shouldn't buy bootlegs anyway 
Having owned this system now for a couple of years I have had my ups and downs but overall I am pretty happy with it. For the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers. Yeah! On the negative, I don't really understand why they skimp out on the DVD side of things- I mean my $200 pioneer handles the range of DVD's much better. Of greatest concern for me though has been voice re-production. Voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds, and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem, it doesn't do a very good job. Consequently, it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and DVD's. Also, just a small note, to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud (so if you don't care too much for neighbours that won't be a problem). Overall, my music sounds crisp and I love hearing every little noise in my music, so I still have a smile on my face.  
SELLER'S: For an honest review go to the CORRECT page for the Bose 321 Graphite w/ Accoustimass 3rd module and two satellite speakers. That will have the correct retail rate and draw the true end-buyers/purchasers. This price of $700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here. I hope this helped you in your endeavors and I look forward to honestly/fairly competing with you in the future! BUYER'S: Buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or "mistakes" on the sellers' part in contractual agreements to Amazon customer service. Because if this ad by that company/seller is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system (2 satellite and 1 lrg Acoustimass) you are in for a steal! literally, so get a goin! Lol Disclaimer: this review is an anti-review posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description (which is it?? 2 speakers or 3???) in this advertisement for above mentioned product. Why isn't BOSE listed as a seller?! DOH No slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true 
I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology. But there is a reason this item is discontinued. It locks up when playing certain DVDs. Sometimes after selecting "play movie" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen. Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say "Bad Disc" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing. You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system. Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know. But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule 
I bought this 18 months ago and while I had some problems with the set up, I got help from the store where I bought it. It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject! Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose. That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it. Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)! They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work. There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else! Any recommendations? Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them. I normally don't like having to pay extra for a warranty, but if you insist on getting this product, I'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty 
I live in a small home and a large 5 speaker system with sub-woofer,plus reciever and dvd/cd player was just too much. True, the 3-2-1 doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistels of a lot a less expensive systems, but the size, ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock 
bose 321 is a nice stuff and good for the room. the sound is clear and crisp. a lot better than a usual mini component. no need to set up an elaborate sound system because this will do the trick.handy and easy to use. good quality sound for such a small piece. thou a little expensive but no regrets because its a bose. im a satisfied customer. so far i dont have problems. please dont let me have one 
This charger is really good value for money. This charger shows each battery's status individually and charges them quickly. i did not monitor the time to count the minutes and seconds but it was reasonably fast. Also refresh feature is best. i like the looks and functions of this charger 
We used this charger with a DC inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a Sony DSC-H5 camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges. The 2700mAh battery is great 
Charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking. Charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest 15-minutes charger I used. but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly. The build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side. compare to the one I previously owned. Generally, well worth the money. GOOD BUY! 
You can never ask for more from this product. 2700maH. That's huge. Runs my discman for weeks (I roughly listen 1 hr everyday). The digital display is very good and accurate. The refresh feature is what makes it different from other similar products. Now forget about the "memory" bug in your battery. Given the price, it is worth your while 
If you are trying to get a good quality charger, then Sony BCG-34HRMF4 is made for you. Pros: 1] Looks Good 2] Battery Indicator. 3] Can charge single battery/cell at a time. 4] Auto power cut off 5] Also works with 240V in Europe. 6] Sleek and light wiegth 7] Refresh button - works really good to get ur battery life/power back. Cons: 1] Its fast but not that fast. It also depends on the Batteries you are using. 2] If started Refreshing, then will take more time [still its good 
This is the second Wacom tablet I own and the third tablet in general. The other wacom is the 9 x 12. Which, at the time, I thought was the greatest. And the Hyperpen (my first tablet for a starving artist)... well, don't. Don't buy it. Stay away. Horrid thing. Save up and get a small wacom. With the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right. The size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors. And, with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area. The touch stripes are useful but really not necessary. Only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability. The 6 x 11 is just about perfect 
Having the Wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures. It is the best investment I have made lately in my business. It saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other over-use/strain problems related with high mouse useage. I can be much more precise on my work in photoshop! I would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers "must have list" 
This is a great product and company. The install was free of problems and the tutorial on the CD got me up to speed in a couple of minutes 
It's a great item, I'm loving it. It's been veru helpful in my scrapbook photos.. 
The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it 
I bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and I use it almost every day so far so good, I don't expect to have any problems with it. I used to have a small wacom graphire and I used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now I own a new one the only advice I can give to you is to keep it clean, wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth jo 
This product is wonderful. I have had it for about a month and use it with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Corel Painter IX and it still amazes me. In my research, I saw that many people were purchasing the 6x8 size (maybe for price), however, if you have a widescreen format monitor, like myself, you will be much happier with the 6x11. Once you are over the short learning curve, you will find you even use it over your mouse for regular computer use 
I'm a cow and like most cows I use Photoshop heavily. All I can say is that I can not believe that I went as long as I did without this tool. Other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes. One thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode. I use a 24" Dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and I was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration. Wacom definitely did their homework. To be honest I found it to not be that useful in 3D Max, but in Photoshop it's a WMD 
Ok, if you have two monitors side by side, or a single wide-screen format, this is the way to go! I use this tablet with the Mac G5, with full functionality, and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen. I have used the smaller tablets from Wacom, and they work very well, but this particular product is designed and constructed VERY WELL and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use! Having the assignable "ExpressKeys" left and or right is really slick for repetitive tasks. This model stands 5/8" high/thick, 10 and 7/8" deep (front to back), and just under 16 and 1/2" wide. Take two late model white Mac keyboards and set them one behind the other, and that is about the footprint this item covers, (width and depth). So, you will need some desk space, or I have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen. Quite comfortable! In any scenario, this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use. Thanks Wacom 
This card is not too fast but good enough for my camera... Well that means nothing to me, I don't have your camera and I could buy it for other things. There are 65 Reviews as I'm writing this, and nobody has contributed speed tests, not even estimates! The ones that don't mention speed at all might not care, but those who do should at least give approximate read/write timings. The easiest way to do this is by plugging the card into your high-speed card reader (not your camera or other specific device as the device can be limited in speed). Then select a bunch of image files or any other files (at least couple of hundred MB worth of files) and copy them to the card. Time this. Divide the total MB amount by the time (in seconds). And you will get approximate information of this card's Write time! Do the opposite to test the Read time. This won't be 100% exact, but if at least 2 or 3 people do this, we'll get a pretty good idea of the card's Speed capabilities 
The delivery and the product was good. I got what i was expecting 
Sin mas comentarios me parece un producto de lo mejor, lo unico que la supera es la de 4 gb, y a pesar que no es de alta velocidad no he tenido problemas para grabar video con mi camara casio ex-z850 
After i purchased this card, i have travelled a lot and have taken several pictures... it just works perfect with my Canon digital camera. 
So much cheaper than buying a flash mp3 player... I've had this and other similar Sandisk memory cards for up to two years without a problem. Have dropped them repeatedly with no loss of data. Transfer speeds could be quicker for taking photos, but overall, a great buy, especially as it expands the capacity of my Treo 650 to five full length movies or twenty-four cds worth of music. I only wish someone would make a practical case that could hold multiple secure digital cards-they're so compact, I have to be careful not to misplace them. 
I bought 2 of these cards and use them in my Treo. I can fit several movies and tv shows on each card which makes for a quick commute on the bus/train or even a nice getaway over lunch.. 
This SD card is pretty good, and of course, very very cheap. Maybe the speed is a little bit slow comparing with other SD card, but it won't cause too much proble 
It is very good on memory storage. It can keep my photos much more than 800 photos. However, with pretty big memory, my camera is so slow that I have to wait for one miniute before it is ready to take photos 
I love my 2 GB SD memory card. I use it all the time and have had no problems with it 
Fabulous product --- now I can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range. Happy I purchased this one -- very trouble free 
We really loved the item. The size of the Flash drive is perfect! We have a tight spot to insert the driver and this item fits perfect 
The 2.0 GB SanDisk Cruzer Micro flash drive looked like a good deal when I saw it on display at Office Depot. It was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files, was rated for USB 2.0, and was reasonably priced. My first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 GB Iomega I use at work, but, alas, such wasn't available. Unfortunately, I waited too long to put the SanDisk through its paces, or I would have tried to get a refund. As many others have remarked, it is horribly slow. While backing up my roughly 10,000 files, I found that it was taking about a second per file -- longer for the big ones. This translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation. Bulk deletes take just as long to carry out. Using my Beyond Compare file synchronization software to *read* the SanDisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until, for no obvious reason, it hung on one particular Word document this evening. I couldn't even get my Windows XP machine to shut down without yanking the SanDisk from its slot: the usual "safely remove hardware" operation wouldn't work. After three attempts to read the same file, and three reboots, I tried to delete it from Windows Explorer -- and this operation hung too. Finally I was able to do the deletion from the DOS prompt. Just like 1985! I then recopied the file, and now Beyond Compare can finish its work without a hitch. But can I trust the SanDisk to deliver up my precious files when I really need them? I dunno .... So, it's back to the drawing board. Maybe by now Iomega has come out with that 2.0 GB model. As for the SanDisk, I'm reminded of that painful adage: you get what you pay for. Ugh 
Bought this about two months ago. Never liked it for two reasons: -The rubber cap is so easy to lose. (Guess that's why it comes with spares though.) -Utterly slow! This is what was most uncomfortable with the drive. Yeah it's slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said. Still, it's annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive. Then unzip when you want to use/copy them. Not practical. And now, well, it just stopped working last week. I mean completely, for no reason. Just great. Like one day before I was going to sell it to someone else. Stay away from this one 
But I won't because I paid good money for it. As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files. I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please 
I like the size. The speed on reading and writing is usually just fine, but when writing a group of small files it takes ages 
I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product. Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk. I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive. Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product 
I bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that! One day I plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn?t respond. It?s a XP sp2. I unplugged it and tried again with the same result, the same with the regular pc?s where I usually use this flash drive. Bottom line: money wasted. Being a regular costumer of sandisk, I must say im very dissapointed. The must frustating thing is that I wont get a refund because the 30 days expired. Besides, it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one (the 512 micro flash drive). So, try some other product. 
My opinion will probably differ from other reviewers. This strap works well IF you have the extended battery pack installed on the camera. As to be expected, it is quality and would be handy for those who like to keep their camera in their hand ready for action shots. Personally, I went back to the neck strap because, if using the hand strap, the camera is tied to your hand and that hand is unusable for much of anything else without putting the camera down. If you're out roaming around, the neck strap frees your hands up, reducing your fear of dropping the camera, eliminates the possibility of setting it down for a second and having it disappear and, with the neck strap, the camera is readily available. I have to give it a 5 star due to the fact that it does exactly what it was designed to do and quality made. Mark H 
Alot Better Then Wrapping The Neck Strap Around Your Arm Or Hand... It Really Depends On What Kind Of Photography You Do. I Shoot At Night Clubs And Weight Can Add Up. I Have A Canon Rebel XT, Hand Grip With 2 Batties, Canon 550EX Flash, And 50mm F/1.4 Or 17-40mm F/2.8 It Feels Alot Better Using The Hand Strap... 
I originally bought this for my 20D with the BG-E2 batterygrip and when it arrived found that no instructions on how to safely attach it were included. After a bit of googeling I found those (in the MKIIN manual downloadable from Canons web site) and it felt pretty secure. It certainly helps when you are using larger lenses and its good value for the money. I have now upgraded to a MKIIN and have moved the strap to that body. If you find it hard to use the main dial you have probably tightened the strap too much 
I wouldn't be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That's all there is to it, that's what it does and it does it well. On the down side, and it's a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap, I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use. I use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. If Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here 
I bought htis accessory because I do not fancy pretty much the neckstrap. I hate to feel my neck aching after a while due to the weight of my 10D plus battery grip and lens. I rather to carry it in my hand instead. So I thought this handstrap would give me the extra safety feel I was needing. After receiving it I noticed it is only intended to be used with "grand cameras" , like the EOS 1 series (film or digital) or to those other series cameras that already have a battery grip attached to them. Fortunately that's my case in which I always carry my 10D with its BG-ED3. I tell this since a 10D, 20D, DRebel or 350D body does not have a strap eyelet on its base. Only their compatible battery grip has it. So be aware that this nice, safe and comfortable accessory could not be attached to your prosumer camera if you don't have the corresponding BG. 
I owned the Canon EOS 1-d, which I sold to obtain the "latest-greatest" EOS 1-d Mark II. My first model(1-d)came with this handstrap, and I found it to be VERY, VERY useful, and incrediby imporant me, being an action-sports photogropher-  Imagine my dismay and anoyance at discovering that this item which was so useful and,(IMHO)absolutely necessary as my wonderful handstrap (WHICH WAS INCLUDED in the previous model)..... had been left out of the "newer and so much improved" version.  I've called and emailed Canon repeatedly(WHICH I STRONGLY SUGGEST ANY/EVERYONE DO)trying to bring attention to this issue, which, to me, is unexpected, and a completly unacceptable discrepancy. Then consider the 30 plus dollars that Canon is TRYING to charge for it, and well here I go, off to my old fateful Amazon to GET ME ONE !! Actually, its from Adorama, and only about 20 bucks, instead.  As for my review of the strap itself, if you haven't yet gathered; Considering the cameras weight, and me constantly running up and down dirt hills chasing motocross racers and the like, I found it literally, indespensible! Highly recomended !!  Bob W. MoXioN Digital Production 
This is the best alarm clock I have ever had! We live in the mountains and the self setting mechanism still worked within 10 minutes. Two alarms and more features than I ever dreamed of 
The clock itself works well. It did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect (we set a backup alarm the first night). The idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea, but why would Scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio? Doesn't make sense to me. Granted, I live in a rural area, but I am able to receive both AM and FM stations from as far away as Fresno, some 50 miles away, on other radios in the house (including a small portable, battery-operated one), and we do have a local FM station. The tuner is so sensitive that I had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station. I am unable to receive one static-free AM station, and I eventually, very gingerly, dialed in two fairly clear FM stations (one Spanish-speaking from Fresno, one local), but neither stay tuned in overnight..by morning when the alarm goes off, nothing but static. A strange thing though...once, while trying to locate a station, I received a fairly clear one from SALT LAKE CITY....wow! I plan to return the product 
The other reviews I am reading about this clock do not do it justice. I just opened it 20 minutes ago, and it's on my desk already synched with the Atomic Clock. I am very impressed. The green LED is awesome! I own a lot of atomic clocks, and this is the first LED one I've seen besides the ... Sangean/Proton one. This thing is solid, and it looks like it was made in the 60's or 70's when you had heavy, quality electronics in a tight package. This is worth way more than the selling price 
When I received it I read the quick set up and plugged it in and within 5 monutes everything was running. The digits on the clock were just the right size that I could see without my glass from accross the room. The radio was not high fidelety but satisfactory 
I used to have this same unit under the brand name "Emerson Research" It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model. For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store 
TENGO YA MUCHO TIEMPO UTILIZANDO LOS DISCOS MEMOREX, TANTO DVD COMO CD, Y SIEMPRE HAN RESULTADO SER MUY BUENOS. POR LO GENERAL LOS COMPRO EN EL MOMENTO EN QUE ESTAN EN OFERTA, QUE EN AMAZON CASI SIEMPRE ASI ES. LOS RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE, LOS QUE TIENEN MALOS COMENTARIOS AL RESPECTO POSIBLEMENTE SE DEBIO AL PROCESO DE QUEMADO, PROGRAMA O QUEMADOR 
I too bought these after not finding spindles of the Verbatim DL. A few work, but only a very few. I have an NEC recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these. The machine is a dual Xeon with 2GB of RAM, so this is not a resource issue. Sigh 
These disks would not work with my Sony brand DVD writer. I have tried several other brands and so far everything works but Memorex. 
Backed up some movies and not even 1 played well. They either skipped or didn't play at all. I backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files won't even open... says damaged or corrupted files... ABSOLUTE JUNK! I will stick with Verbatim from now on 
To back up my personal DVD collection I burned 200 discs. 100 on these Memorex DVD+R's, 100 on Philips DVD+R's. EVERY Memorex had flaws during playback. EVERY Philips was flawless. I've been buying Memorex for years but I'll never buy Memorex again 
I have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of Memorex and so far I have not had any problems. They work just fine on my Sony dvd burner 
Memorex DVD+R's are the best. Price keeps dropping and never have a problem 
Memorex dvd blanks are my second choice and I bought two 50-count stacks of these because they had a great deal going on. In a perfect world, I would have gotten the same deal on 50-count stacks of Maxell dvd blanks. They are the best but you'll have a hard time finding a deal on them since everyone else knows they are the best. 
I have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months, I have only had 1 burn badly. Haven't found a dvd player yet that they won't play in 
Really liked it. Would have rated it 4-star. But last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turn on anymore. Only the clock works. Just one month out of warranty. From other reviews, this seems to be a common problem 
I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago. I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all. I had it for 15 months 
Overall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons. However, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now 
I purchased this unit about 18 months ago. After the warranty ran out, the unit first quit working with -R media. Then there is an issue with finalizing the DVD, which makes the dvd unusable. Unfortunately, this is after you record your show. Then all is lost. It started making squawking noises like something is very wrong. It never remembered the language or channels. Panasonic never did anything about this. After reading others with these same issues, I would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer 
I bought this product after reading several reviews here at Amazon. The setup to configure it to my cable system was a little tricky, but once we got passed that, it worked like a charm. I have only lost one recording on one of my DVDs. It's strange how that happened, since the dvd wasn't in the player at the time. But that was almost a year ago and it hasn't happened since then. This recorder is intuitive and simple to operate. The conversion from video to DVD is flawless, and the finalization process is easy to understand as well. I especially like how you can adjust the recording time. Mine's currently set to about four hours. I am totally blind and needed a product that was easy for me to operate without sighted assistance. This definitely fills the bill! if you're looking for a great product at a reasonable price, buy this one! you won't be disappointed! I've converted almost 50 videos and recorded several TV shows with this recorder! great buy 
Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006: We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific). We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both. For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine. Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them. At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times. But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it. Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended. If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse. Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon. We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results. Here is my update, which I wrote November 3: This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon. 
This is an excellent machine. I bought two of them. There are a few things you need to do. I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x. I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x. I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x. Some other brands may not work. One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little. Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day. Give it a rest between recordings. One or two per day is okay. Definitely give it room to breathe. If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe. Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides. You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly. One of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM. They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched. You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM. Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program. Only works on the DVD-RAM. I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes! Get one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made! Throw away your VCRs forever! Just remember to baby them 
I noticed there are several reviews on various products here, but this review is on the Panasonic DMR-ES10S (the S is for Silver). I am not a technological wizard and impatient, so my husband set this up for me. I've had it about 5 months now and LOVE it. This is on the TV upstairs. I bought it because I was having trouble with our old RCA DVD recorder (unreliable), but that's another review. Once setup it is complete, the unit is very easy to use. I read LOTS of reviews before buying and realized the cons that others had were not of concern to me, i.e. we don't have HDTV yet so 16:9 ratio not important. All I needed was something to record things from my TIVO unit and a DVR that could record on multiple DVD formats (DVD-R, +R, DVD RAM, etc.). Featues I Like: I like the ample space the unit allows for actually typing in the name of the show (unlike the RCA which only let you have a few characters). I really use the Flexible Recording feature to exactly fit a movie or to fit lots of shows. I DID have to play around with this feature to figure out how to work it while recording multiple shows on one disk (manual wasn't useful with that part), but I use it all the time. The picture is really good, even with a 6 hour recording time, which I use for my decorating shows. The Change Thumbnail feature is also great. It allows you to select what picture displays when you browse through the programs. This is a wonderful feature that is important to me, esp with decorating shows, where I have the thumbnail be a feature of the room that I like. After reading some of the reviews here it seems my unit has A LOT of cool features which would be great for someone who is into electronics. I am a basic girl, so I don't need a lot of bells and whistles. I just need it to do what I want without any hassles and without reading a 400-page manual. My only quibble is that some of the buttons on the remote are kind of small, even for my smaller female hands. The RCA that I put on the TV downstairs is starting to mess up a lot now, so I will be purchasing a new unit. I've read reviews on the DMR-ES20, but since I am happy with this unit I am going to buy another one 
I bought this for my folks for Christmas. It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple. Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes. I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong. The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right. After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly. Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life. Really, if you're new to this technology, you're not going to have any problems..believe me..A++ 
I would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months. There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days. The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time. The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box 
So when I first got the iHome for Christmas, I loved it. Well, I loved it in spite of the glaring bright light, that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep. However, after awhile the iHome will not register my iPods existence at all. Today I was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again. I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations. So, the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled. Useless 
I bought the iHome so that I could choose which songs to wake up to off of my iPod, and it worked well when it actually WORKED. After being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off I tossed the item - it wasn't worth all of the problems to keep at all if I couldn't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning. Other people have mentioned the too bright display and the "gradual volume increase", which I eventually got used to, but I could see how they would be incredibly annoying 
A good add on to ipod compared to other costly or cheap products. The sound is good. It is loud enought to fill a medium hall with music. The wake-up and sleep funtions are good. The buttons are not smooth kind of make tik-tik noise. I wish we could forward and skip songs from the base. You can dimmer the back-Light if not needed. Recommend it 
This item is very nice, its practical becuase have a gos size, great sound and in only one iten you can have a radio, clock and sound for your ipod. I recommend i 
We have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light. Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room! My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it. We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio 
Im probably one of few people on here who has a positive review for this item! I got this for christmas from my dad. I believe he bought it at best buy. Ive had it for almost ten months and I havent had any problems; it still plays the ipod, the clock still works, the date still works, and everything else still works. You dont even need to change the time; theres a switch on the back that lets you change it from standard time to daylight savings time. I dont know why people are complaining about that and the light; the light isnt THAT bright. If I encounter problems I will write another review but so far everything is perfect 
I got this for Christmas last year. I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort. I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I. Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop. Save your money and buy something else. Take your time and read through the "cotton candy" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced 
I like the features. I'm satisfied with the sound. The user interface could be more intuitive. HOWEVER, my overriding complaint is that the docking port (as many other reviewers have mentioned) is not reliable. The connection is poorly constructed, so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the iPod isn't there any more. If they could fix this quality problem, it would be well worth the $100, but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can't justify it at any price 
This product was a corporate gift and the recepient loves the gift. I selected this product based on the recommendation of from other reviews. The product is easy to use, holds nearly 200 songs and great for exercising or use in the car. 
I searched and searched for the right mp3 player to use when I work out...and although this one had some bad reviews, so did all the others I looked at. So I was a little scared, but went ahead and bought it...and I'm so happy! It's so cute and sounds great!!! Very glad that I choose this one 
I've had my Sansa (the white one, with a pink silicone case... very cute) for about a month now and I couldn't be more pleased. I've had several players -- an Archos, an iaudio 'u2' -- and though both had their quirks, especially the Archos, ultimately the problem with both was the same -- their rechargeable internal (non-CHANGEable) batteries wore out and wouldn't hold a charge anymore. In contrast, the Sansa takes one AAA battery. Such a simple thing, but what a joy, I'll have the player long enough to see if it wears out normally from use! It comes with a battery, and I haven't had to change mine yet. Radio reception seems rather good. It doesn't have line-in recording, as the iaudio did, but I didn't use that very much and haven't missed it. Has voice recording, which I haven't tried. Mounts right up on WinXP without any need for extra software. I've never wanted an ipod, because of the nightmarish software required to negotiate with them. The Sansa's supplied ear buds sound very good, but are a trifle large (which is probably why they sound so good to me), noticeably larger than ipod ear buds; but are a little too large for my ears. One more thing, I am pleased with the Sansa's interface -- there are enough buttons to comfortably handle all functions. The 'u2' had only a few buttons, a tiny display and no manual to speak of, and was a little frustrating to use. The Sansa is much clearer, has a very readable display, and very straightforward function selection and settings. Cleverness and simplicity is all well and good in a gadget, but take it from someone whose vision is not terribly good, if you can't see it, you can't use it. I'm glad I got this one 
I recently purchased this item and I am very happy with its performance and quality. I use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight 
The software provided with the unit worked well, I bought another mp3 player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer. The menus are easy to use, and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the Sansa MP3 player will automatically shut off if you don't hit the play button again. My only complaint is the unit eats a lot of batteries- it is best to go with rechargables. I get about 6 hrs playback time per battery. 
I'd say the main strength of this player is it's easy to memorize, easily accessible buttons. By the end of the first day I was able to perform all of the player's features without taking it out of my pocket. That being said, the only complaint I have is that the equalizer isn't that effective, although this could also be a feature of the headphones too. They fit comfortably (the headphones) but the sound quality is only so-so. There's really not that much bass, but then what can you expect fron earbuds? Nevertheless, I'd definately recommend this player to anyone tempted to join the wonderful world of portable mp3 bliss. 
I've been using NEATO and the 'MediaFace' software for years. I LOVE the ability to calibrate the output so I can create 2 sided CD booklets that line up perfectly! Sure you have to do a little test printing but that's what gives YOU the control. This is definitely not for the Dumb and Dumber set. If you want software and label materials that are 'designed with your mind in mind' and don't want creative control, then this is not for you. I use it for CD booklets, CD labels, and jewel case inserts all on glossy paper and folks think the results are professionally done. If you don't want to put in the effort, the get something else. But if you like the freedom to express your creativity, this will give you the room you need 
No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie 
and I'm still happy! We initially had to get used to the software and the printer setup and yes, you do need some patience during the learning curve of this creative process - it's not the normal daily routine of most people. We never encountered any errors when creating the actual labels or printing them. We also have not had any problems upon using the labelled CDs or DVDs. We're happy with the product 
I bought this for my laptop and have been very happy with it. I love the compact size. It's so easy to store in my laptop bag. The performance is great 
This usb hub is EXCELLENT!! its small and compact, it actually communicates at usb 2.0 speeds, and the best part is that it doesn't need a separate power supply just to opperate. This hub is designed to get all the power it needs from the usb port. Overall this is the most well designed hub I've seen and with it having such a low price tag you can't go wrong 
My Dell Laptop D600 running Windows XP, didn't recognize the device when I plugged it into either USB port. I contacted Targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that I should try it on another PC. If it doesn't work on this laptop, I have no use for it. There is no CD ROM for support drivers and Targus support stated that I shouldn't need any drivers. Went to Microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn't listed. I should have researched this before the purchase. I would not recommend anyone purchasing it. 
I HAVE PLUGED 3 USB CONNECTION (HP ALL IN ONE, OPTICAL MOUSE, 1GB PORTABLE USB) I HAVE USED THE PRODUCT FOR 1 MOUNTH WITH NO PROBLEMS. THE SIZE COLOR ARE COOL. 
This is a very usefull product. Performs well and stores easily. Makes a great addition to my laptop bag.. 
The one I got in the mail was black (very happy about it.. blue didn't exactly go with my laptop setup). It is very small and can easily be stored in your laptop case or anywhere else you might want to put it. Seems very sturdy and the usb cables do not come out easily which is very nice 
This little hub is just about everything you could want it to be. It's extremely compact, I don't think it's physically possible to have a smaller 4 port USB hub. At the same time it's also very solid and feels durable. The hub provides plenty of power and charges my ipod. A handy LED light turns on when the hub is plugged into your computer. I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but my ipod updates at the same song-a-second rate as it normally does when connected directly. I suppose that the hub does impose a certain bandwidth limit, so that you cannot have 4 devices transferring at the full USB 2.0 transfer rate at once, but that's to be expected. This would be excellent for any laptop user with a dearth of ports, or someone who just happens to need to connect a few more devices to their already maxed out system 
I have purchased this DVD player to replace an older version of Sony DVD player that started to have problems playing DVDs (especially the scratched ones). Besides that I wanted to have a capability to play other formats (including photo discs, etc.). I think this was the right choice for the money. The DVD player handles every task as expected. Sony didn't disappoint 
The device works perfectly. The picture quality is excellent, the documentation is adequate, and the overall robustness of the machine seems good. Loading is slower than my old DVD player - a Toshiba. I really like the way I can watch one DVD part way through, replace it with another, and have the player still remember my place in the other one. I also appreciate the HDMI interface but have not upgraded my television to take advantage of it yet. In the end, I was willing to spend a few extra bucks for a quality player and based on performance so far, that's what I got 
This DVD player provides a picture to my 46" Sony TV with 1080p that is very close in quality to HD broadcasts. The only way to watch a DVD movie nowadays 
Using the HDMI output provides a HD quality picture. I'm not sure if more expensive units have a better picture, but I doubt it. Save your money and buy this unit instead of investing $1,000 in an HD unit that has only a few movies available in the new format 
Great, and easy to use. Dvd's look amazing via the HDMI on my Sony 50" SXRD. Home entertainment at its best 
I have been thrilled with the quality of this player. I bought it for the HDMI connection (High Definition Multi Media Interface). The player has performed with everything that I have thrown at it. The DTS is incredible and I believe this unit is worth every penny. Don't settle for a phony - buy a Sony 
If you are looking for quality in video equimpent, there is only one brand for me - Sony. The DVD player has slick design, great video output. We watched the latest Star Wars Episode III and the pictures were awesame! Strongly recommend 
Recieved in 2 days, paid $116.99. Slim, lightwieght. Takes a little time to load but produces a really nice picture. Hooked up to my Yamaha RX-V1600 reciever and then on to a Samsung LN-S4692D LCD HDTV, both via HDMI. Looks to be a quality DVD player with nice finish and again a really nice picture. Watched The Incredibles and Madagascar with the kids and everyone was really impressed. Would definitely recommend. Also played DVD-R's on this player, no problems 
I just ordered, but do not yet have my 1080p Sony Bravia XPR2 tv and my Dish Network HD package. So what I am watching at the moment is a Sharp Aquos 26" 720p-ready tv. I took the Sony dvd player out of the box, connected the HDMI connections to the player and to my tv, turned the player on and put in a digitally mastered retail dvd. I didn't even have to open the operating instructions booklet. The picture is so incredible that it makes it hard to watch regular tv with my non-hd tv Dish Network receiver. I played a musical jpeg slideshow made with Memories on TV and burned onto a DVD+R. Not only were the 6 megapixel pictures beautiful, but the HDMI connection gave me the full quality of the sound, even without a surround sound setup. I then tried a movie slideshow made with an old version of Roxio. The player actually improved the look of the little movies taken with an old Sony still/video camera. These were very grainy as they were not really dvd quality. They were over 100% improved when played through the dvd player. Installation took about 2 minutes (because my tv HDMI connection is in an odd place). I highly recommend this playe 
I bought this for my computer, and it is useless. The unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine. Be very careful when purchasing these. I would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend. APC has offered to give me a discount on a new one if I use this as a trade in, but it would cost me a fortune to ship it. Tiger Direct will (according to the website) only guarantee items against defect. Therefore, I'm left with an expensive doorstop. Don't make the same mistake, research before you buy! My 19" monitor and Pentium 4 are too much for the 350VA 
I bought this UPS to help protect my Tivo and TV. It worked fine out of the box and when I pull the power it keeps my TV and Tivo going fine 
I'm not sure what happened with flagday1960's APC UPS, but I have had mine for over 2 years and it has performed flawlessly. Whenever I've had an electrical power outage, the APC's software notifies me that it has reverted to battery power, and informs when commercial electrical power has been restored. I can view the stats for my UPS - when and how long the last "event" (battery power activation) occurred, and the UPS current charge status. My 350R has only 6 outlets - 3 battery/surge and 3 surge, the current 350 model provides 8 outlets - 4 of each. While I can replace the internal battery of my 350R when it does die and is unrechargeable, I'll likely buy a new 350R in the near future, primarily for the extra 2 outlets 
I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced? In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

Bought this to free up my DVR - turn recorded movies into DVD's etc. It works pretty well, accurate capture, easy to use. Not crazy about the Software that's included. Capwiz is OK, but limited, Ulead Video studio is clunky and sometime awkward to use, although between the two you can do just abou anything you need to. It works BEST, if you record the HD version of shows. Even if you don't have an HD TV, the converted image is much better 
The hook up and downloading the software was very simple. There was a error problem with the drivers. My computer is fairly new with windows xp. I called there support and was told to try it on another computer. I install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened. I sent it back to Amazon and credit my account, and bought an other brand. Amazon is so great about handling returns. 
VHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect 
With my Pentium 4, Windows XP system this was extremely easy to use and did not present any technical glitches. Very pleased 
I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD. Only mpeg capture device I have tried that gives a good quality picture. Any other device I tried only worked converting to avi's, if at all. Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version. If I use S-video instead of composite video, computer locks up (but that may be a problem on my end). There are 2 different capture methods (Capwiz and Ulead's Video Studio). Sound was a bit behind using Capwiz, use VS instead. Would be nice to be able to set bitrate rather than be stuck with variable, but now I am just nitpicking 
I have lots of analog video tapes from the 80's and onwards. This device works very well in transferring them. The video audio are in perfect sync. Pro: Very good device, very easy to use and install. You need a very powerful processor to work it right. Also, as I discovered and mentioned in the manual. You must connect this device into the primary USB port. I have a hub where I first connected but the light was not coming on and the computer did not recognize the device. I opened the computer and made sure that it is connected directly into the USB attached to the motherboard and it worked very well. The customer service is responsive but they will not work with you on your specific computer issues. Cons: This device is processor intensive. You MUST have the latest processor running at 3.XX Mhz or above and turn off all other ancillary programs while you are converting. I encountered no problems when I followed the above guidelines. The minimum requirments listed by the manufacture is probably absolute minimum. It is a very good product and very easy to use. I love it. 
I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on. So I return it to Amazon 
This product worked perfectly transferring to the computer and then using the included software to put several home movies on one DVD. It also worked perfectly to transfer directly from VHSC tapes to DVD without transferring to computer. Very simple set up and instructions. The quality of the transferred videos was excellent! You can also clip out parts of video seamlessly if you transfer to computer first very simply. With the included software, you can do or add just about anything, music, frames, voice, etc. No problems with the box getting hot or malfunctioning after over 4 hours of continuous use. 
I tryed to use this on an older p4 1500 megahz and had a few glitiches during the recording (loss of frames). Then I broke out the wifes new laptop and had no problem at all. The S video from my old High 8 Video Cam came out perfect. Sound was perfect too. The point is you MUST have the power. I do not care what the manufacture put on the box. I would have given it 5 stars if the recomended computer requirements matched what I had to use to get the results. 
I was very excited about this unit when I ordered it, but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate (VBR) encoding, and the DivX recording feature didn't actually work most of the time. (A blank screen or a green screen was the result.) Unfortunately, given these problems, I returned the unit. I think I'm going to look at an older ADS unit without the VBR feature to ensure quality, and then do any DivX transfers by software. It seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image. Too bad...this one really had a lot of potential 
It took a lot of searching before I decided to purchase a good printer and this one is a great one. The pictures are clear and they print fast. I showed them to friends and didn't tell them that I printed them at home and they were very surprised when I told them. Spend the extra money and get a good printer. This printer also include photo ink, which is really needed for a clean print. Make sure you also get the right paper 
... That said, I'm very happy with this printer. Other reviews, like the one on C|Net, have faulted the printer for mediocre text printing. I can't really address that complaint...have a laser printer for text and only use the S830 for printing photos and I'm very, very happy with how it performs that function. It's fast, I like being able to replace the ink cartridges separately, supports Exif if your digital camera outputs the encrypted data and the pictures are indistinguishable from those printed conventionally. It's the perfect color printer for my advanced amateur needs 
We bought this printer to go with the canon G2 we bought.Excellent choice.First I must say if you are considering buying it from anyone other than Amazon[.com],DON'T.I have dealt with Amazon[.com] for years and they are the best at what they do,no one comes close.The printer is so easy to setup,not like some of are other printers.We are using Window XP,it went like a breeze.in lees than 30 minutes I was printing pictures.... I am still learning all the features,but the quality of the pictuers is as good if not better than any other.. And it is fast fast,printed 2 4x6 pictures in less than 4 minutes,I have found that you do need to buy quality paper.I used the Canon 4x6 bordless paper first until I ran out, then I switched to another brand,big mistake.Use the right paper and you to will be amazed 
I've had this printer over a month now. I have a Fujifilm S602 digital camera. The quality of the photos, whether 4x6 or 8.5x11, is excellent. The definition and sharpness of color are fantastic. The creativity potential is outstanding. I'm thrilled with this purchase 
I've had this photo printer a few weeks now. I don't consider myself technically proficient. I totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine. You cannot go wrong. The photo quality is astonishing. I've printed professional quality photos and framed them. The results are fantastic. For someone who is techno-challenged, I had this up and running very quickly 
I have the digital camera Canon Powershot S200 and just purchased this printer. Set it up last night without any difficulty and the photos I printed were fantastic. I am very pleased with this purchase. Would highly recommend this printer. I did use generic photo paper to start out with and it worked just fine. I am hoping that in the long run this printer will pay for itself and cut the costs of having pics developed at the store 
Let's be honest. This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working. I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc. I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE. I don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed. If you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support 
I'm measuring, first and foremost, ease and precision of scanning. Speed of scanning and ease of installation on the computer are, in my mind, about the same for both the Wizcom QuickLink Elite and the C-Pen 800C. They differ sufficiently, however, in the primary question of ease and quality of scanning. For the record, I bought both at the same time, with the intent of keeping the better of the two. You can just go ahead and buy the C-Pen 800C. I have had one horrible experience with a pen scanner by Siemens, the "Pocket Reader." It was truly useless. It scanned so poorly that I just put it aside. By the time I though to return it, Siemens was no longer making it, and I couldn't get customer service here in the U.S. The Wizcom QuickLink Elite is not so bad. It's serviceable. I don't think it lives up to its 95% accuracy guarantee, but perhaps meets a 90% threshold, measured impressionistically. It's interface is also reasonable and satisfactory. However, the C-Pen 800C is even more precise, truly approaching 95%. Moreover, if you discount errors in spacing from this accuracy percentage, its precision is even higher. Whereas the Wizcom is just as likely to make a content error, misread letters, etc., the 800C's errors are more likely to be the absence of a space when there should be one. A rare missed space doesn't make you puzzle over the text when you come back to it two months later. C-Pen is also lighter, and it's rechargeable, so while it's more expensive, in the long run, you'll save on batteries. Both have comparable single-language dictionaries, though Wizcom has more built in or for free (C-Pen allows you one free dictionary, including bilingual ones). Wizcom is a only a bit slower on the uptake, but significantly more likely to warn you "Scan too fast." I've never had that from C-Pen, and again, the precision at any speed is appreciably better with C-Pen. Both have comparable PC and PDA compatibility capacity 
These are the basic clear cd and/or dvd SLIM JEWEL CASES that you are looking for. They are not as easily breakable as other brands. They are NOT recyclable 
Items were as advertised, arrived ahead of schedule and undamaged. In short, the sort of product and service one should expect from any retailer 
For slim jewel cases these are quite impressive. Their durability is outstanding and actually better than I expected. Usually I have been using slim cases primarily for data Cds. These are so convenient and durable I began using these for music CDs. I like them and continue to use them. 
They would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken 
These boxes are half the size of regular cases, just right--not too bulky like the regular ones 
two of these jewel cases equal the size of a regular cd case. buy them and conserve space. there great 
Got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much BETTER than the ones sold here locally, and they were CHEAPER !! 
The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped. 
I like keeping all my stuff in one place, but don't like CD folders, so these slim cases are great. I accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack, the case didn't break, and the cd was fine. All in all, a great product 
I bought this stereo for my daughter's 9th birthday. It's a great system with really good sound for the size. It is easy use and is super thin and can hang on the wall. It doesn't sit on a shelf easily; it tends to fall forward because it's heavier in front, so you should plan on hanging it 
I have had this for about a year and it has worked well. I specifically bought it to tune into radio, so I have not used the CD player and whatever functions it might have. Pretty light, 7 of 10 sound quality, can hang on wall, detachable speakers. Good for cost. I would recommend and buy for a gift 
I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office. the reception on this unit is great. Bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations. The sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in. If you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound. 
We were looking for a compact system and this particular system takes up very little space! It also has amazing sound 
I bought this stereo for my baby's room. I needed something unobtrusive, with decent sound and that didn't break the bank. This fit the bell just perfectly. And just in case you're wondering - this unit is almost EXACTLY the same as the $20 cheaper MCM235. The only difference is that the MCM240 can play MP3 CDs whereas the MCM235 cannot. Both, however, will play CD-R and CD-RWs. The speakers can be mounted directly on the center unit and the whole system can be hung alone, or the speakers can be separated. However, when the speakers are separated, they cannot be hung on the wall themselves because there is no screw latch on the back of the speakers. The speaker cords are long enough for most placements. If you decide to have the speakers mounted on the unit then you will pleased to know that there is a special place for the cords to be hidden behind the main unit. The only visible cord will be that of the electric plug. It plays CDs and MP3 CDs (on CD-R or CDRW) well, and the sound was crisp and detailed. The remote control is about the size of the iPod Nano (but a little wider). The buttons are rounded - but here's the first deficiency - the keys are NOT backlit. Until you can memorize the placement of the keys, you will not be able to use the remote in the dark. There is a blueish backlit display on the center console. It displays the track being played, or the radio station in tune or, in standby mode, the time. Here's the second deficiency - the display can only be read when viewed head on. I mounted mine a bit too high on the wall, and I can't see what's displayed. There is a timer feature and a sleep function. All in all, this is a good system. But even with the caveat that you get what you pay for, the designers could've been a bit more thoughtful in the implementation 
This thing is a joke. It doesn't play loud enough except for low volume listening. There is no handle to make moving it easy. Cheap, flimsy construction and a door that you know is going to break soon, no battery back-up for the memory. I would rather pay more and get something better. I am going to return it 
POSITIVES: -Slick design and looks good mounted on the wall. -Plays MP3 songs burned on a CD -Good sound loud enough (not for parties) -It serves the purpose well -Good deal for the money NEGATIVES: -Some old MP3 CDs skip. All the new MP3 CDs I burned worked perfect though. -Clock turns off when the system is turned of 
Looks good, sounds ok. The dynamic bass boost introduces hiss but makes the sound more bassy. 4 stars for looks and price. -1 for sound quality. 
The tablet has been very helpful in my digital drawing classes and in my interior design business for quick sketching. It is user friendly, sturdily constructed and electronically dependable. I prefer the large screen format and this size is very adequate. If it should ever have to be replaced, I would purchase the same model. I highly recommend this particular tablet 
Overall this product is worth the price. Overview To begin the footprint of this particular tablet is 17 5/16 X 13 1/4 so you have to have enough desk or table space to accomodate it. The overall finish and quality of the tablet had some issues; mainly some rough casting of the clear plastic on the top. Ergonomically it feels at home placed on the lap with the dimensions making it quite stable. The express keys feel solid though I don't use them as much as the quick keys. Performance Though I am a relative tablet novice I have taken to the Intuos 3 better than I have with my sibling's Intuos 1. Pressure sensitivity can be adjusted to suit one's tastes making the tablet itself quite responsive. the pen is light but solid. I prefer the black felt tip stylus point rather than the standard plastic. I have laid a sheet of vellum (thick tracing paper) over the tablet in order to simulate the sensation of drawing on paper (i prefer some resistance.) The pen reacts the same as if the vellum weren't there. The 9x12 image area allows me to use my shoulder for more fluid movements when I draw and does not feel cumbersome at all. However i have not used the tablet mouse, it feels rather heavy and does not glide across the frosted plastic plate due to the layer of "felt" underneath the mouse. Installing the driver software is a snap and the customization menus are easy to understand. NOTE: the option to switch from portrait to landscape (9x12--12x9) is available in case you're wondering which I was. This tablet has made me more efficient and more productive. (software used: Photoshop 
Whether or not you are a 2D or 3D artist, this tablet makes it all the more enjoyable. I had an Aiptek 12000U which died no less than 3 weeks from purchase date. This Wacom is so much better. I love the customisation of it. Its fantastic! Only one gripe with it, and it may be just me, but I would love it if you were able to customise the touch strip and buttons to each program - just as you can with the stylus. Throw your mouse away - this one's a keeper 
I have been in the computer industry for well over 20 years and I have used just about every graphics tablet there is over that period. I recently had a need to get a new one for my own personal use and I got this Intuos3 9x12 and it is one nice piece of equipment. No Batteries, no power cords just a short USB cable to the computer. And it truly is an aesthetically beautiful piece of work. I have no complaints what so ever; My Mouse works perfectly I am even using it to play Links2003 (Golf). Don't expect to drop strokes right off the bat, it will take a round or two to get used to the "swing" just like any new "Club" would. However I would not consider using it for any fast action games; only smooth steady strokes, billiards, golf, etc In short, everything I expected and more. I love this Table 
Best ever, I can tell... My choice for a 9X12 format was a decision taken based on my traditional arts background, since I make oil paintings and traditional lineart drawing for concept arts, I use very much wide strokes by a combination with "wrist and arm wide motion". So this tablet is well suited for this task not too much exagerated on size and not too small for the wide movements. A 6x8 Wacom Tablet would be more restricted to me, but for those who like small area usage for drawing and painting this 9x12 has a digital adjust so you can work with it as a 6x8, but remember to have space on your desk, it's not a 'mouse pad' definitively, get a 19" monitor screen - flat it down on the table, that's almost the same space you gonna need. By the way... for those thinking on something different from WACOM tablets... don't think! WACOM is the only one you can trust 100%, no doubts, I've tried many... If you don't know wich wacom suits best for you, I suggest you go to www.wacom.com, they have a questionaire there to help you out, but it is simple: if you are a pro... get this Intuos3 or better Intuos available, that's the hardcore professional choice, if don't need much pressure sensitivity, and make 'lighter' work, go to the Graphire, and if you are a pro and want something to work with milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get a Cintiq (this one is top expesive one). Other application will work perfect with it too, like 3D software, I use XSI, Max, Maya, Zbrush(this one only with a WACOM please!), Modo and many other applications for composing and editing like Combustion and Premiere, it changes the way you work for a better productivity, believe-me. Pen tilt is great with "Painter" software, what you maybe would take a day to finish you do in seconds literally, with a wrist sweep and tilting the pen you can create amazing effects in one second. Also will reduce the stress on your hand and arm caused by the mouse, it will improve your life quality by not harming you like a mouse does when you get to many our on computer. Besides it has programmable buttons on it and a smart scroll, so you may use you mouse only for games after that. Another important point - the USB cable is huge enough so you can work confortably away from your monitor screen with the tablet on your lap if wish so. To finish: I love my 9x12 Wacom, if you buy it you will love it too, and give it the accessories so this babe will get happier *lol* A travel bag, replacement tips (nibs) kit, and for sure if you can or need... buy other pen like the 6D art pen and the airbrush so you will make extraordinary artworks. Hope this helps on your choice. Best regards! Eduardo S. Janiszewski CG Artist and Animato 
I have to say that after years and years of greedily drooling at the thought of getting a 9x12 Intuos tablet, I have finally purchased the 9x12 Intuos 3. And it's huge. Not HUGE like thick or heavy, just spacious. And so far I can't put it down. Really. I haven't cleared enough space on the desk. But then why would I want to? It doesn't get hot, it's the right size for a lap desk, and I can use it for most of what I do from 9 to 5. Except typing. Anyway here's my take on it: ----------------------- SIZE I'm moving up from the 4x5 Intuos 2 which will now live in my laptop bag. You may be just fine with a smaller tablet, and travel concerns may make this a little unwieldy. The full tablet is 3 additional inches on the left right and bottom sides around the 9x12" area, so it's a grand total of 17x13" in the bag. No big deal for anyone accustomed to carrying an art portfolio around. Stack two Intuos2/Graphire 4x5 tablets flat on top of each other, and that's about how thick it is. (If you're considering buying a 9x12 you probably have a few of these lying around) TABLET SCREEN AREA if you don't like the overabundance of space, you can always limit the tablet area in the Wacom control panel to ANY dimensions up to 9x12, mapped to any area of the pad. I feel sometimes that I am moving my arm way too far all over this space for most of my work, so it's good to know I can reduce the physical tablet area controlling the entire screen to a 3x5 box in the corner. This particular feature is very good for "tracing" a photo or small object placed on the tablet and still drawing to the entire screen. Likewise you can limit the amount of screen area the whole tablet can control. For VERY VERY precise control over a small screen area this is the best option. An alternative to zooming the image to work details. Also useful for avoiding accidental menu-clicks, and prevents the pointer from migrating into toolboxes or clicking scrollbars and other windows. All this space does provide a fantastic level of control. It's just different. You realize how little you move the mouse most of the time to work on a computer when you start using your entire arm to work. Usually it's all about the flick of the wrist. QUICKPOINT "VIRTUAL-TABLETS" An added bonus I discovered (not on the smaller tablets to my knowledge) is the "Quickpoint" dual tablet feature. Two "virtual" tablets control the same screen. The lower left or right corner becomes a tiny 2x3 tablet, and the upper left/right opposite corner becomes a 7x9 tablet (approximately). The 2x3 gives you fast access to the whole screen with very little pointer movement, and the 7x9 gives you precision control. Two tablets in one! WIDESCREEN / DUAL MONITOR SUPPORT Happy to say it works very well with dual screens. You can span both screens using the full tablet, choose which screen to control exclusively, or reduce the functional tablet area to match the aspect ratio of spanned/dual monitors. As far as widescreen monitor support, this tablet can automatically adjust the active area to match the aspect ratio of any screen. So if you are considering the 6x11 widescreen Wacom, remember this tablet can double as a 7x12 widescreen. I used a grey Sharpie to draw faint lines on the tablet surface to map out different screen ratios. BASICS USB of course.. Nice 8 foot cord so you can move around a bit, excellent for putting the tablet in your lap. Has a pretty blue light. Thankfully the 1/2 "tracing overlay" is gone. Sorry to whoever was saying that was the primary feature for them.. In my experience it just gets dirt and coffee and whatever else you carelessly do to your tablet all stuck up in it. And if you accidentally crease it.. oh the pain... STYLUS NIBS The grip pen is nice, bigger than the Intuos 2 pen and has a good weight, otherwise the same. The "6D" art pen actually has two tips inside the felt nib, but sometimes the tablet doesn't register both tips (critical to rotation data) unless you plunk the nib down FLAT on the tablet before you start your stroke. Without both tips active it just works like the grip pen. The nibs are interesting, I haven't discovered how the springloaded "Stroke Nib" is so much different from the standard white plastic nib. Says it's "amazing" on the website but really.. ehh. But the "Felt Nib" is definitely different. Kind of makes me think of a Flair Pen. It has considerable friction against the surface and squeaks on the tablet like a marker. This is good if your hand isn't surgeon-steady or if you want slower more precise strokes, but it is a bit grabby if you press too hard. Draw lines with a Sharpie marker on copier paper with a little extra pressure and it feels about the same. My previous trick with the Intuos 2 was to tape paper on top of the tablet to add friction. MOUSE As for the 5D mouse, I think it's easier to use a regular mouse on the side. Although the extra surface area makes a mouse much more practical on this pad than it is on a 4x5. The mouse will jitter and is act strange IF you don't put the tablet in "mouse mode." The software *should* just do that automatically, but sometimes it doesn't catch on. Once the mouse is specifically set to mouse mode in the driver settings it should stay in mouse mode any time it's on the pad, and can be moved relative to wherever screen pointer is just like a regular mouse. Otherwise in pen mode the mouse directly tracks the tablet precisely where you place it, and the screen pointer jumps to that spot--just like the pens. If you WANT you can put the pens in mouse mode, but again, weird. MACROS I use the Wacom mice mostly to run unrestricted macros that Microsoft and Logitech don't seem to want to let you run with their "programmable" mice these days. Think "QuicKeys" on a mouse. You can program an unlimited string of keystrokes and menu commands, and link the macros globally or restrict them to specific applications. THE "EXPRESS KEYS" (THOSE RECTANGLE THINGS ON THE SIDES) You can program the left and right sets independently. Again, you have complete control of any method of macro you'd like to assign to any of the buttons. There is a whole list of options for each button and both scroll bars. So you have eight buttons and two scrolls to program to your heart's desire on the pad. IN ADDITION to simple button macros there is a "pop up menu" you can assign to any of the buttons. Just like a Windows Right-Click menu, it appears wherever the pointer is--only you have complete control of the menu content. CONCLUSION My only gripe goes to Adobe for disabling most of the stylus/pen features in Photoshop by default. It gets a little tiresome enabling size, opacity, tilt, and rotation for almost every brush.. As for everything else the tablet was meant to do different from a mouse, pressure sensitivity, tilt, rotation, high resolution tracking, lack of jitter.. it works fantastically. I'm just going to have to adjust to the huge 9x12 stroke. So give your Aiptek to someone you hate this Christmas, and hook yourself up with a Wacom! Next up, Cintiq! Paycheck.. well, better job, paycheck, THEN Cintiq! --------------------------- WISH LIST Why do we have only one pointer (focus point) on the screen? Why not a dedicated pointer per-device now that USB makes the mouse addressable? A "Wacom Glove" would be great. If I could put on a special glove or just little thimble-nibs and have fingertip control on this tablet they'd have one helluva product. Kids could fingerpaint! In addition to that, is there any technical reason why given the right input device this thing couldn't function like one giant "touchpad" with surface area detection and everything? If the 6D can recognize two points simultaneously, what's the technical limit? bye 
This tablet is just great. The only problem is that it's a little to big. When i want the cursor to cross the screen i have to move my entire arm (not only my hand). Maybe 6x8 inches would be the best size 
This is an awesome tablet! It has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator, photoshop and painter. The pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse. The size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time. 
I've been using the 9x12 for a few months now and I have been very happy with the product's improvements over the Intuous 2 line. I love the fact that it is only about an inch thick and fits easily into my lap--the Intuos 2 was monstrous by comparison. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the mouse, which should be among the most accurate mice available, suffers from awful jitter. I am not even touching the mouse and it is jittering up and down about a pixel or two. Still a very good pen tablet, but the mouse part needs work 
I'm a digital media student and freelance multimedia artist, and my mom is a retired commercial artist. We both bought the tablet after putting up with the Aiptek version for a year. Cons: The included mouse doesn't have many of the movement control features of a regular mouse. I'd recommend using a normal optical mouse along with the tablet. Besides, you're not buying this for its mouse. Pros: Loads of included software (that you'll actually use), perfect compatibility with Adobe Photoshop's features (a huge discount for Adobe Photoshop CS is included), surface is washable and scratch resistant, no batteries required, awesome sensitivity at any pressure or angle, two pens in one (top of pen works as eraser tool in Photoshop) and above all, it's the industry standard choice. All other reviews will agree. There's no better tablet, and I stand by that. I've used it with everything from Adobe Photoshop CS2 to Adobe Illustrator CS2 to Macromedia Flash MX to Alias Maya.

Rated as 3000 hour bulb life when purchased, today they claim 4000 hours. Bulb lasted only 900 hours. Service at "unfocused" does not care about creating a satisfied customer base. Would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis 
I purchased this multimedia projector on behalf of a local non-profit organization after comparing its specifications with other projectors with similar prices. Several comparable projectors are available currently, and I chose this one because of good experience with its previous model (the X1) and slightly better specs. Our initial experiences with this unit have been completely satisfactory. The controls are easy to use, the output is bright and sharp for an audience of around 40 people. I was disappointed, however, to discover that it has only one adjustable leg toward the front of the projector. That leg is used in tilting the projected image upward, but we had to use found materials to level the unit. Two legs would be better! 
EXCELLENT IMAGE FOR LITTLE MONEY! I bought the Infocus X2 to replace a worn out and broken $15,000.00 "high end" CRT projector. My budget would not allow for a more appropriate replacement. While the X2 could never satisfy the true videophile, who usually spend anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000 dollars on a projector, it was never intended to. That being said, I will say that the Infocus X2 when being shown on my Stewart 100" screen is projecting an impressive image that is pretty close to the $15,000 unit it replaced! A true videophile will certainly see the difference, but your average person will not. With my limited budget, I am quite satisfied with the very good image quality. DVDs are sharp and clear, TV is quite satisfactory also. If you are looking to enter the big screen front projector market, and you don't want to spend more than a thousand dollars, here you go! But seriously folks, even though it works, stop shining your projector on a wall.... get yourselves a screen. There are special reflective properties in a screen that a painted wall doesn't have to really bring your image to life. 
Bottom line - best major purchase I have made since I bought a home with a finished basement! I got the projector and mounted it on the ceiling in my basement projecting on a light-brown wall. I expected that I would need to paint the walls white, or get a screen, but was shocked by the amazing picture quality. Here are the details: 1) Comcast Cable with HiDef Box. Hidef program is so amazing it makes me want to cry. Sports programing blows the mind away. I even enjoy watching boring hi-def shows with the wife, like the Oscars, just because I am so amazed at how crystal clear the picture looks. You feel like you are there! Regular TV looks surprisingly great too, but setting it up right is critical. Make sure to change the aspect ratio back to Native (vs 16:9 when watching hi-def channels). Ensure that the HDTV cable box has the following settings: Aspect Ratio (controls regular programming) = 4:3 letterbox Output Type (controls High def programming) = experiment with 720P vs 1080i 4:3 overide (controls regular programming)= 480p. I am also using the expensive $99 monster DVI cable to connect to the cable box. This is essential to make regular TV look great vs grainy. Get the DVI to M1 connections, wires and adaptors - you MUST budget this into your overall budget or the projecter will not be a great buy (see my "problem" section below). 2) X-Box. I purchased the Hi-Def cable/wire from Microsoft for $20. Once you buy the cables, you can go into the Xbox dashboard settings to allow for 720p and 1080i. Most games are in 480p and 16:9 format. The few Games in highdef look fantastic! You can check hdtvarcade.com to see the exact resolution of every game. 3) DVD player: Since the Xbox only outputs in 480i, I wanted to try the upconversion DVD players. I first tried the Denon 1910. That did NOT work when using a DVI cable!!! It might have been because it was refurbished or possibly it was because the Infocus X2 is not HDCP compliant?? I'm not sure, but the 1910 warns against non-HDCP compliant units and InFocus says that x2 is non-compliant - so that's my best guess. Next I tried the TOSHIBA SD-5970. That worked, and I hooked it up using the $99 Monster HDMI to DVI cable. I'm not sure if it was worth it, because DVD's look great, but NOT Amazing compared to HiDef Comcast programming. The verdict is still out, but I have never seen any of the DVD's like Finding Nemo that supposedly look MUCH better with progressive scan DVD's. I can't tell much difference between when DVD is set to 720p vs 1080i HDMI output. Once again, everybody that comes over, including the sceptic wife, is shocked by our basement - they all say its like a full-scale theater, much bigger and clearer than a regular big screen TV and I don't even have surround sound yet - that'll be my next big purchase. Infocus X2 is highly recommended, but be sure to check out the problem section below:  Problems 1) My InFocus X2 does not have any component inputs. That means to get premium quality, you must come through the M1/DVI input. If you have a DVD, Cable box and Xbox like me, it is a real pain to switch the cable in the back (especially with a ceiling mount). I got myself a step ladder to make it easier. The DVI switcher for 4 DVI cables is TOO expensive, almost $400. 2) Be prepared to spend at least $3-400 after you get your InFocus to purchase DVI cables for the cable box, possibly HDMI cables if you buy a progressive scan DVD player, as well as adapters to connect your DVI cable to the M1 computer port... Its definitely worth it, but just be prepared. In my opinion, the progressive DVD player is optional (saves you approx $150), but the cables are mandatory. 3) No way to turn off unit with remote (and yes it is still a little noisy in whisper mode, but once the movie starts you can't hear it anymore). I have it set-up so that after it cools/powers down I just turn off the entire unit on the wall switch since it is ceiling mounted. 
The de-interlacer chip is unneaded as long as you use all progressive sources. In fact when you input HDTV it uses the same scaler as the X1 and H30 projectors. The image quality is great. Just dont try and watch TV on it, you'll claw your eyes out. I can't push that enough, the projector is awesome, as long as you use NO interlaced sources 
I love these cases. The colors are nice, the see-through feature is helpful, they keep my DVDs and CDs clean and are great for mailing, also. Not one of mine has ever broken, but you DO need to open them correctly so as not to destroy them (I can't imagine any other way one would break unless you stepped on it, bent one severely, or beat one to death.) They are made of the same type of plastic in which commercial CDs are packaged. I always prefer to buy this exact type and brand of case 
But I love these cases. I have had no problems with them yet. They snap closed, stay closed and are fairly sturdy. Granted, I do not go throwing them around or anything. But for organizing things and keeping the dust off, these cases do a good enough job for me 
I've used these (and similar) cases for years. No problems, even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them. 1) I've never had one crack. 2) They hold the disc securely, but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it. 3) As long as you open them properly - from the front (clear) side by pulling near the corner(s) while holding the back (colored) side - they open fine 
Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE! 
They are okay for eight or so dollars, but they don't last very long. Then again, I used these for a digital camera so maybe that's why they get drained so quickly. However, for the price I still would buy them again 
Price can't be beat. I don't see the difference between this battery and some of the more pricier ones. I have two kids under two and these batteries are a life saver 
I have used about half of these batterys. Mostly in clocks and different items around the house, but also I used them in the flash for my camera and they held up real good. I have a lot of rechargeable batterys, but these are better because they last a lot longer. Often the rechargeable batterys only last for a few months if that long. Alkaline batteries for me can last for up to a year and longer. If Amazon went back to free shipping on these then I would buy them up and give them to friends as a gift or a prize. I do not know what the shipping is, but it may still be worthwhile. I just know so far these batteries have held up real good and I would highly recommend them. 
I bought three boxes of these and have had great success with them. I can't tell the difference between these and Duracell's or Energizers. Very pleased with my purchase. I will buy some more 
A ton of batteries for cheap...they work great. Always good to have bulk stock on batteries. Pleased with how many come in pkg 
Nothing great - don't expect to have long-life and high drain. But if you want a bunch for use in all the kids' toys, clocks, alarms... good dea 
It is pretty cheap stuff. I did not expect excellent quality, however, in my speedlite 420, it works excellently, and supposed to provide more than 300 flashes with a focal length average of 70 
My daughter uses a Cochlear Implant that has the option of being powered by 3 AA batteries. We have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest. We have tried Energizer, Duracell, etc. She needs to replace them every day and a half. Since the Implant is a high power draining device, every extra hour counts. These batteries are one of the best values out there. 
I bought the BE650R for two purposes: The first is to provide battery backup power for my home computer system on a daily basis. The second is to use with my portable generator to provide "clean power" to all of my electronics when the power goes out and I'm forced to use it. The BE650R handles both situations very well. The provided PowerChute software installed without a problem and managed the computer system perfectly when the power went out, completing a graceful shutdown when the battery got low. APC only provides the most basic version of their software (you have the option of buying an upgraded one). It doesn't have any reporting or testing features, but given the size of the BE650R I don't see why you would care. This is a UPS for workstations and small electronic, not servers, so I don't see the need for robust UPS software. The UPS hooks up via a provided USB cable and the setup was very easy. The BE650R provide about 11 minutes of run time for my system, which is comprised of a 350-watt computer, 19-in lcd monitor, wireless router and dsl modem. As for using the UPS with the generator, I haven't had any problems so far. The generator maufacturer recommmends using at least a surge supressor with their product, but I figured a UPS would be one step better. I would definitely recommend this unit 
I own 3 compact flash cards by viking and bought them in this order, 128Mb, 256Mb, and recently 2Gb. I have never had any problems with any of these cards and have always looked for Viking Compact Flash cards whenever I needed any. This 2Gb card works perfectly with my Ipaq pocket pc storing a variety of files from mp3 to mpeg (video) to word, excel, and maps for my pocket pc gps system. I did try a Lexar card once and found it did not work with my pocket pc as well as this one as not all the files on it were recognised. I will always buy Viking compact flash 
I've owned various Viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance, until I purchased this 2 GB CompactFlash card. It's possible that this card works well in other uses, but I found its performance unacceptable as storage for RAW images shot with my Canon Digital Rebel SLR. Anywhere from 1/5 to 1/10 of the images were corrupted, particularly bad in continuous shooting mode. Contrast with my Lexar Media 512 MB and 1 GB cards, which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions, and without as much of a lag time as the Viking card (often left waiting 15+ seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to "recovers") 
I've used Viking CompactFlash cards in digital cameras for years and have *NEVER* had a problem with *ANY* of them. Never a glitch; every bit has always come through perfectly (and I did have a glitch with a CF card of leading brand "S..."). I do not own this particular Viking card, but I've owned 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB Viking CF cards and used them in 3 different (Canon) cameras. As far as I know, this 2GB CF cards uses the same technology as at least the 1GB card I use all the time. All that said, standard Viking CF cards are "8x" write speed (about 1.2MB/s write speed). That is slower than many other CF cards. That may be an issue for point-and-shoot digicams with limited image buffers, but I've never found that to be a problem in digital SLRs with large write buffers -- the camera continues to shoot more photos while the Viking card finishes writing to the CF card. For the price, the Vikings have been "winners" in my book. A previous reviewer commented about difficulties with Viking Customer Service -- I have to wonder what the problem was that he experienced with the *product* that let him to call Viking's Customer Service in the first place? Was it anything serious, or did he just have a question? He never said. (Not that the Cust Svc comments he quoted are excusable, if true; but they're so outrageous that they're a little hard to believe) 
Batteries have quite a long life, and recharging takes one hour 
For the money this charger is a great deal. It charges the batteries fully in a short time. And comes with a car charger 
Works OK. The batteries do get hot by the end of the charging period and it takes about 15 min to let them cool down by themselves. I don't know how long they would last if charged so quick but so far they look fine and the price of similar batteries is cheap. This is not an extremely "smart" charger (special wave cycle, etc.) but it works 
THIS CHARGER IS EASY TO USE AND YOU KNOW WHEN THE CHARGE IS FULL AND COMPLETE. IT ALSO CHARGES THREE AAA AS WELL AS DOUBLE AA. YOU CAN ALSO USE THE TWO CENTER CHARGING TERMINALS TO CHARGE TWO 3 AAA OR TWO DOUBLE AA BATTERIES. THE PRICE IS ALSO GOOD AS WELL AS THE SHIPPING CHARGE. THE FOUR 2400 BATTERIES SEEM TO LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THE 2000 BATTERIES. CWJE 
Read the plan carefully. Not everything is covered under this plan. They will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they don't have to pay. Too many exclusions for an "everything is covered policy" Don't waste your mone 
I have been charged however I did not get a copy of the policy to date. 
I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product. 
I have not had N.E.W. coverage for this Apple product however I had a washing machine covered by them. The washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same. N.E.W. used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off. Throughout, N.E.W. was great and made every effort to fix the machine. When the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that I paid for it. They did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that I actually had the machine 
I like it, works nice. This mouse is small comfortable on the hands 
Very easy to use. Comfortable size. I would recommend this product if you don't need advanced "bells and whistles" 
Mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold antenna.Mine would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top. The idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off. This being said it may deserve 5 stars if the correct surface is used 
Upon buying my notebook computer, I immediately purchased this mouse. The touch pad on the laptop is sufficient for basic navigation, but for heavy use, especially web browsing, an external mouse is a must. The mouse has an USB adapter that clips on the bottom of the mouse for convenient storage when not in use. Mouse works fine even several feet away from laptop. The curved buttons that fit your fingers make using this mouse very comfortable to use for long periods of time. I highly recommend this devise for greater laptop productivity enjoyment.  
a great mouse! perfect size, nice features. Simply plug it in and it starts working! Seems to be well made. To install the battery you have to push in the silver logo button on the back end of the mouse really hard. Then the casing top pops off. however, for some reason, at least on my hp laptop- when this is plugged in the screensaver will not come on if left there. I need to unplug it if I'm gonna be gone for awhile. I love this winter blue color, I'm so glad that I chose it. I have only had this for a couple months, but it works fantastically. I just hope it lasts as long for me as some of the other reviewers have said it lasted for them 
Use this mouse every day for over 2 months. I've never had to reset it, and I find it to be very accurate. Battery life seems to be great as well,(haven't changed mine yet). Travels really well with the USB receiver mounting on the bottom of the mouse. Highly Recommended 
I bought this item like 2 months ago, and now it's broken. I'm sooo frustrated. I 'd not recommend buying this item 
My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue. Now I read all these reviews about it breaking on people. Well, I'll write back when my other roommate's break, and when my cousin's break. Don't get me wrong... but it was great while it lasted. Less than half a year. Gonna go back to my Logitech. That never broke on me 
I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The "L" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive. I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver. 
This little thing works! The read and write speed are fast, I'm very happy with it 
Bought this to make use of all the spare SD cards I have around the house. It is fantastic. It fits in to my Laptop's USB port and all the computers at work. The largest card I have used was a 1.0 GB card. The speed of the card reader seems to be dependent on the quality on of the SD card 
This device is great for carriying around with your camera, you can review and share the pictures with any PC with USB available, data can also be recorded and easily recovered. 
This is a super media card, perfect for storing and transfering lots of extra pictures 
Esaki si ta campion, un tremendo idea di e sistema pa por load up un potret digital ariba bo PC. hopi bon y facil. Esaki ta pone cu bo por saca bo potret digital y pone ariba bo PC via e systema aki di chip.(Tremendo 
The convergence of electronics. Instead of spending in a Memory Card and a USB Memory separetly, you can use them both (saving some money and space). You also improve the video and picture downloading to any computer or Xbox without cables of software installation 
its very helpfull when you manage several SD cards, its faster and very reliable! 
I use it from 6 months with an 1GB microSD card and with my old 512SD. Reads and writes so fast. And cheap. Wish it have an neck strap 
I use this to read the Trans-Flash card from my mobile phone (with SD card adapter). It works as expected, but seems to have higher throughput to/from the flash card than my desktop 12-in-1 card reader. I bought it on someone else's recommendation to begin with. Very satisfied 
The chare for shipping and handling of this small item was RIDICULOUS! I would have been better off buying at a Retail Store. 
I bought this memory card for my Canon SD 200...after using it for approximately 3 months with no problems whatsoever, I took a video and the card just flat out broke. First the screen said "Image not available" and then "memory card error". I tried everything to fix it - but nothing worked. I lost all the pictured I had stored on it, and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed...now I have a Panosonic one and I'm really happy with it. My advice: splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand, and it'll be worth it

This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera, but was never delivered. Now Amazon wants me to review it, so here your are.. 
It came comp. with the purchase of a Kodak dig. camera. What can I say: it can hold a bunch of pictures. I rated it a 4 only because I have nothing to compare it to 
We needed an extra card right away and were happy that we paid for the fastest, overnight delivery option. The card came in time, and we used the card extensively on our trip to Australia 
I am pleased with the card...I was not at all pleased with the" website "that promised I could upgrade the size but kept refusing to lrt me.....frustrating 
I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again. Timely delivery and exactly what I saw on the website 
Bought this charger through Amazon when we lost the charger that came with our Canon Digital Rebel XT. This seemed like a good option at a good price and it has proven to be so. I actually prefer this to the Canon charger, which always felt like more of a travel charger to me. This one can sit on my desk and I don't have to get down on floor to get the battery. It also includes a car adapter and foreign power adapter - nice extras. To me this is the right charger to have around the house, even if you have the Canon charger (bring that one on your vacations since it packs up nice and small with the caveat that it's easy to forget in a hotel or something). Get an extra battery when you get this charger too so you can always have a charged up battery ready to go 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Lowepro offers consistently well-made products, and this SlipLock Pouch is no exception. It is secure and well padded. I use it to hold a Garmin GPS60CS GPS receiver, but you could easily use it for a small digital camera or other accessory. It is a bit deep for the smallest cameras, which might tend to get lost in the bottom of the pouch, although you could put additional items like spare batteries underneath to raise them up. The main pouch has a double-closure design for good security: a drawstring closure is covered by the main flap with a velcro seal. A front mesh pocket is a good place to store small things like spare AA batteries or, in my case, an external antenna for the GPS. A cleverly designed double-velcro sealed belt loop allows you to easily and securely attach the pouch to your belt or the hip-belt of a backpack without having to remove your belt. Two D-rings on the sides also give you the options of using it with a shoulder strap. NOTE (5/3/06): The photo of this pouch has recently been changed and no longer looks like the pouch I reviewed. I don't know whether it is an error in the photo or whether Amazon has used the same description for a completely unrelated product. NOTE (5/27/06): Correct photo has been added again 
This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock. But it has one major flaw. The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves. After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together. If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars. But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good. 
Even after reading all the reviews on this product I was still amazed at the sound quality and loudness this little speaker set offers. Perfect for traveling, camping, parks, etc. I would buy it again! Oh, also comes with a set of plug adapters to use in other countries and also a pair of nice earbuds 
First of all, these are good speakers, nice design but it has one flaw. batteries... A. it eats them up ...FAST B. if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with, it wont go as loud, and if it thinks your playing it to loud, it will start..skipping.. or something of the sort. But, it has good sound quality, and honeslty when your on the go, when do you really need it blasting? Also they are just..barley large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly, but it doesnt weigh much at all. And i really like how if i ever say..lost my Ipod somehow, it has a Cd player (walkman) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod. ( the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters ) 
Amazing sound with surprising bass.Very light and portable. I invited a group of friends over and they counld belive the sound coming from this small unit 
"I was replacing a portable Sony devise that I really liked, but busted one of the speakers. This is a very attractive unit, with excellent sound. I can even plug in my mini disc player. It is very portable with a nice black bag. I was very pleased at the sound of this small unit. Includes earphones, an adapter to play other devises besides IPODS and Universal outlet (powers up the IPOD while playing)...also runs on 4 AA batteries." 
I purchased these speakers in order to be able to have some music on an upcoming vacation, and boy was I happy. the speakers fold up into a very compact size and even come with it's own case. The extra adapter plugs allowed us to it in French Polynesia to charge our ipod, and since the speakers work with 220 voltage I did not even have to get a converter. Outside of the hotel room we used batteries for power without any problems. Most importantly the sound quality is great!!! 
I am a graduate student in linguistics working with an indigenous language in Oaxaca. I brought this speaker set to Mexico with me this year as a replacement for a bulky Panasonic cassette transcriber. It worked like a dream. Instead of using cassettes for transcription we used mp3s recorded on an Edirol digital recorder. Instead of a transcriber we used a laptop with windows media player and these Altec Lansing speakers. The sound quality was perfect for transcription, and the whole package was lighter and easier to manage than a transcriber. In my down time I got to listen to music. Can't beat that 
Worked great for my 15GB ipod. Unpacked, plug in, put my ipod in, press play and I was good to go. Using it in a 12 x 12 office at low listening volume and find it to be just fine 
This review is a little long-winded, but I am going to share with you my experiences after burning hundreds of DVDs. After all, many of us are archiving data / video we will want to be able to access for decades into the future and currently there are no other reviews for this product on the site. I have used just about every type of recordable DVD media available and have concluded Fuji offers the best value. I recommend you stick with the Fuji DVD-Rs made in Japan. This is important since there are multiple manufacturers who make recordable DVDs for Fuji (not uncommon in the industry). For the end user, the DVDs from the different manufacturers (all under the Fuji name) look nearly identical. You might want to take the time to Google and then download a free utility program named DVD Identifier. You simply put your recordable DVD into your computer's DVD writer and DVD Identifier will tell you who actually manufactured the DVD (many of you might be surprised the brand name on the disc and the actual manufacturer are often different). For example, the Fuji DVDs made in Japan are made by Taiyo Yuden (one of - if not the most - reputable manufacturers out there). The Fuji DVDs made in Taiwan are made by an entirely different manufacturer. Both the Japan and Taiwan Fuji DVDs look nearly identical in packaging and share a common proof of purchase code. However, one set will note made in Japan under the proof of purchase code and the other set will note made in Taiwan under the proof of purchase code. The other way to distinguish between the packages is the made in Japan DVDs will have the plastic spindle cover flush against the black spindle base. The made in Taiwan DVDs will have the black base stick out slightly. I have heard some people say digital is digital and all DVDs are created equal. This is not true. You want to buy a DVD that is manufactured with quality. You might save a few cents buying a cheaper DVD; however, you have to factor in bad burns and lost data. With the cheapo DVDs, you will have more coasters and more DVDs that initially burn fine, but lose the data after a few months. In the past two years, I have burned over 1,000 of the made in Japan Fuji DVDs and have only six bad burns and have not yet experienced lost data from any of the hundreds of successful recordings. I use these Fuji DVDS more than any other brand. I also use the Panasonic DVD-Rs (also manufactured by Taiyo Yuden) as well as unlabeled DVDs from an online wholesaler that are also manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. The Fuji DVDs have an attractive silver color top, the Panasonics have an attractive gold color top. The Panasonic DVDs are also much more expensive than the Fujis. In terms of compatibility, I have played the Fuji DVDs on over 20 different DVD players and have yet to find a player that does not play my video recorded on a Fuji DVD. The 50 pack Fuji spindle regularly goes on sale for $20 at a variety of retailers. 
Like the other reviewer, I also have a NEC dvd drive. I've tried Sony, Memorex, Verbatim, Maxell, and TDX discs but none compare to Fuji. I've also tried generic ones but was p-o'ed every time I got another unintended frisbee. One brand in particular, mentioned earlier, would not "hold" what I wrote on the disc. On the first day, the disc was fine, go back to it in a month, the data is gone! The others would burn fine but more times than not, the quality of the picture would be downgraded, the video skiped, jumps, etc. And yes, I thought so too but nope, it happened on more than 5 dvds I tested. Thank goodness I found these at the store -- on sale! What the heck, I'll give it a try. Can't get much worse. I gotta say, Fuji is all I use now. I haven't even gotten 1 coaster and I'm on my 4th 100 pack! I archive movie and picture files and the picture quality is as good as the first day. I highly recommend these! Spend a little more and get the quality and longevity you'd expect from writing on your dvds. Don't risk seeing your data one day, gone the next. 
I got this for free (after main-in rebates) when I bought NEC-3500A DVD-rw drive last Xmas time. I started using these very recently (15 days back or so). I have burned about 25 DVDs so far and all of them came perfect. Not a single item is wasted etc. May be some of the credit goes to NEC DVD-RW drive. I am very happy with it - so, I got another 50 pack from local Fry's for about $20.00. 
It made little notable difference or improvement. I would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious. 
It has restored every disc I put into it. That includes DVDs, CDs and games. It takes exactly 1 minute to restore a disc and it's much better than the hand-crank versions. What more can I say except buy this pruduct 
I had one CD in $2500 training set that would not read. The scratches were deep enough to be felt with the finger. After running the disc through the Skip Dr it read just like ne 
This is a very good product! Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I was able to repair 6 CDs with minor scratches. 
Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang. The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work 
I've used this to repair several music CDs and a couple of DVDs with 100% success. It's easy and fast to use. I love it - and it's saved me, easily, $50 because I haven't had to replace CDs or DVDs 
I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started. Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own. It really is worse than when I started. 
I foolishly placed my irreplaceable, $200 DVD in this newly-purchased machine as instructed. The result was a disaster! The machine added visible scratches and made playback WORSE, not better. Suggestion: if you have valuable CDs or DVDs, send them to a professional repair service that uses professional equipment. Don't mess around with cheap junk 
First off, I don't give 5's for anything. If you expect this remote to be able to duplicate your other remotes based on a predetermined code for the manufacturer of your equipment, it won't happen. It works for some but not all and didn't recognize most of mine correctly. However, it has the ability through computer hookup to learn all of the functions that any of your remotes have. Takes some practice and bravado but will work. My wife loves it and won't let me put the multiple remotes back on the coffee table. If you are computer literate this thing is amazing. The two downsides are 1) It is heavy. You're not likely to hold it in one hand while lying on the couch and flipping around. It pretty much has to sit on a table. 2) The keys that appear on the RM-AX4000 screen can not be renamed so if a key name doesn't match one on your remote, you'll have to remember what you programed the key to do 
I will make this review very simple. No matter what features you find attractive about this remote, its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable. Unless you have large hands, you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it. (make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it) In terms of features, the remote has only the simplest of "learning" features. If you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn't have a code for.... good luck 
This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off). 
This remote does its job well. I had eight remotes to control the gear in my living room, and this thing took the place of all of them. I no longer lose them in the couch or forget where I put them last...and it no longer takes me five minutes to set up just to watch a movie or listen to music. Macros allow one button press to turn on (or off) all required equipment and set them to the correct mode. The backlight is pleasant, I like the audio feedback of button presses, and the sheer size of the thing feels good in my hands and prevents misplacement. That being said, this thing was a royal pain to get working properly right out of the box. This may be because I have some less mainstream A/V equipment, but the previous reviews do not exaggerate the PC program interface with its endless mouse clicking. Even the so-called "wizard" has multiple mouse clicks for one simple button, which can get very tedious if you have a remote with 40 buttons on it, like for a reciever. Here's a recommendation: skip through the initial wizard as fast as you can, then make a new profile and start out in advanced mode. Even if you go through the wizard, most of your time will probably be spent in advanced mode anyway, because you have to tweak alot buttons to get them working. This may save you much time and headache. This is also where you program macros, the shining star of this remote. Software installation is straightforward. The interface, aside from the points mentioned above, is relatively simple. You can drag and drop components to pick the order you want them to show up on the screen. Everything is clearly labelled and easy to read. Macros are simple too, but only after you get the buttons working properly. It took me a couple of hours to get it to do all Dish Network remote commands. After manually programming each button for the DVR, I had to make a macro to get to "My Recordings" with one button press, and it took a few tries to get it to do page up and page down when browsing the guide. The remote itself has a nice finish, and weighs about like a largish paperback book in your hands. The touchscreen is large enough to poke at it without worrying about hitting the wrong button. The physical buttons are responsive and do not feel cheap or "clicky". After some use, fingerprints show up on the touchscreen, especially when eating popcorn. However, the display is bright enough when backlit that they aren't really a distraction. The menu tree is easy to learn and get used to as well. This remote would get five stars if it weren't for the subpar PC interface and sparse documentation. The actual remote is fantastic however, and well worth the time and effort it takes to get it up and running. Just make sure you burn a CD with a copy of your profile once you get it going! 
Initial setup could be complex for some, but considering all it is capable of i'd say it's worth the time investment. 
My husband told me he would like a Sony RM-AX4000 Home Theater Remote Control for Father's Day. As Father's Day approached, I realized I couldn't remember what it was he'd asked for, so I asked him again. I was nearly out of time to locate this product, but I checked Amazon.com and they had them listed. I ordered one and had it shipped quickly, but I didn't think it would be in time for him to open on Father's Day. The package arrived on Saturday, the day before Father's Day, and Amazon saved the day for me. Thank you Amazon, for all that you do! Kathryn Santos-Ree 
This is a great remote, but the software that comes with it is some of the worst I have ever seen published by an international company. Be SURE to download version 1.1 of the software as the remote still ships with 1.0. It is slightly less painful to use.

I ordered the SimpleTech 1GB CF for my Canon Digital Rebel XT because the price was great and because I had read that SimpleTech made Canon-labeled cards. Two weeks after placing my order, with no word from SimpleTech and no tracking number, I contacted SimpleTech via the Amazon website. I got a very prompt response explaining that they never received the order from Amazon (some technical glitch) but to make it up to me, they would refund my shipping charges and send the card overnight. The card arrived as promised. I put it in my camera and... nothing. I put it in a card reader and got an error. I contacted SimpleTech tech support through their website and got a very prompt response saying that the card was dead and they would gladly replace it. They sent me a UPS shipping label for the return and a few days later I had a new card. The new card works perfectly and, although the fates conspired against me, I would definitely recommend SimpleTech to anyone looking for an affordable, top-notch product. Their customer service was extremely quick in responding and they replaced the defective card quickly and without hassle 
This is a great card to use for your 8 megapixel digital camera. I have the OLYMPUS C8080, and at the highest-quality camera settings, I can get 254 color shots from this card. SimpleTech is my favorite brand, because I've never had any of their cards fail on me, even after repeated washings. Oops. This CF Card is totally dependable. SimpleTech is pricey, but you're paying for quality, which is cheaper in the long run. 
I had a 512 simpletech card, and loved it. I got this 1gb card a week ago and it has worked great. The 512 card was used very heavily for nearly 2 years, and so I purchased from simpletech again. The card maxs out the meter which suggests how many pictures I have remaining to take, unless it is on the highest setting. It says I can fit roughly 950 pictures from this 3.0mp camera on the highest settings, but I have not been able to take that many yet! Batteries only last for 300 pictures, so I probably don't need a card this big. It is nice for videos though, and it can hold about 15-20 minutes of video at 640x480 15fps. It also seems to write very quickly. Much quicker than my lexar card. For most users, I would suggest having 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb. Don't keep all your eggs in 1 basket 
EXCELLECT PRICE AND FAST READ WRITE. WORKS GREAT IN MY CANON DIGITAL SLR 
I purchased this card for a Canon A95 digital camera, primarily because Canon sells this card at their website and because I read somewhere that SimpleTech makes the cards that come with (some?) Canon digital cameras. You can read about the card's specifications elsewhere, just let me say that this is my second SimpleTech card (I also have a 256 MB SD card that I use in a HP 49G+ calculator), and both cards work as well as advertised. I will definitely buy from SimpleTech again. 
The advantage of this surge protector-power strip is that there is a 2 outlet phone jack surge protector on board. I actually had a modem blow out due to a surge, and it came through the telephone line. Now I use a tel-surge protector so I don't have to unplug my phone when a storm is brewing. Note that most surge protectors (baring the kind with huge capacitors) cannot protect against lightning hits, but surges from power problems coming over the lines are common, especially in summer, and these devices can help 
I got this stuff as a gift for a friend of mine. He seems to be happy using it. So I am giving this a 5 star 
I have 4 of these to use with my ipac and also my mp3 player which they are full of all my music and are interchangeable with both units 
Its a great product and so compatibly. I tried several places before buying, this product and as well all the items I buy. Amazon is a good place to try, their prices are 90% lower what you can find elsewhere 
If a disk works and gives me a clear picture and clear sound, it is all that I ask for. For the size of the disk compared to the price, I just don't know how you could beat this product. In my opinion, SanDisk is one of the best. Never have had a problem with the SanDisk brand 
the one gig sd card works better than i thougt it would. it is by far the cheapest one i've ever found and i'll probably get another one soon. FYI: i use the card in my nikon digital camera. with the pics set to 6 megapixals and using the uncompressed format(approx 1.8 meg ea.), i have 190 pics and 10 short 1 min movies and the card is about 80 percent full. that is awesome...........barny 
It was really cheap, the cheapes around. Also it works fine, no complaints. But it looks a little weird, the packaging and the sticker on the card. Maybe a nock off? since it says made in CHina,but it works none the less. 
I bought a 1GB with my new camera because I was giving my other camera and it's 256 memory card to my sister. The smaller card would fill quickly and I'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them. I paid about $9.00 more for my card in Sept., and thought that was a deal. Now, you can get this card for $20.00. That's a steal for a 1 GB. also, I like the little case provided to keep the card safe when I take it to the store to develope the pictures. Love it 
I use this storage card in my Canon SD 600. Get 968 MB of useable space on my camera. A 1GB card is necessary for people who want to take lots of pictures and not fuss with downloading. Only complaint that these cards are still a little pricy and hope that it continues to come down in price 
The product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what I wanted. I have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera, but will try to soon 
Working perfect, amazing the amount of space in pictures you can have!! Great product, more than enoug

These batteries have been awesome. My digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100's of photographs. Flash recharge is very quick. Highly recommended 
So far I have been very pleased with these batteries. My last digital camera had it's own battery and held a charge for a very long time. These batteries have met or surpassed my expectations 
I bought these batteries along with the Sony BCG-34HE4 Super-Quick Worldwide Battery Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteries. Exellent charger, excellent batteries. A real money saver. 
I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough 
I use them for wireless devices and digital cameras, with the Sony charger they are excellent. Much better than the rechargable Canon batterie 
I bought these for my Sony digital camera and I am very pleased with them. Exact fit into the camera and with great capacity, they simply seems to last forever, so running out of power is no longer an issue for me. The sliding case is a nice touch for storing and transporting your batteries. Highly recommended 
These batteries are far stable and durable in long term use. I have owned non-brand name and Kodak rechargeable batteries. They are either unstable voltage output or die out much earlier than their publicized life-span. Sometimes one in pair die out then other remains(Not SONY). I can't use them for the digital camera power source because it requires delicate and stable voltage supply. Those SONY batteries seemed not to go down voltage levels and when their charge are drained, the pair(2 batteries) go down together. It's perfect use for an equipment that needs constant and stable power supply, like digital camera 
This was the best deal I found on rechargable NiHM batteries and that too these are made in Japan by Sony. It has a capacity of 2300mAh. I do not think it gets any better than this. I would suggest anyone looking out for good NiMH batteries to go ahead and buy these 
The reason I love this printer is because of its ease of use, and that's due to it's number one feature - TV output. I've had a tendency in the past to neglect photo printing because once I get our pictures onto my computer, I want to fiddle with them endlessly to "improve" them before I print them out. In the end I never do get around to it. Now we'll come home from a day of photo shooting, look at our pics on the TV and print out the good ones - then I can touch up the photos that need it at my leisure. And if I am too lazy to even do that, it's simple enough for someone else to take over, meaning it's much more likely to get done. It was great coming back from a Hawaiian vacation with my family and printing out pictures that day for them to take home! This printer doesn't get 5 stars because of photo quality vs. cost of goods. You can get the printing packs for half a buck per photo, but professional printing will cost less. The photos from pros will usually look better too. While this is a dye sublimation printer, it only uses three colors of ink, so better inkjets, dye-subs and professional prints will have better colors than this machine. Based purely on tech specs this one should beat out most of the cheaper inkjets (including other stand alone photo printers in the same price range) but I haven't seen any side-by-side comparisons. On the plus side, the Sony does "print" a transparent layer over the picture that'll keep it from fading for quite a while. As for my personal opinion of the printouts (as a casual pic taker with a Canon SD500), I would give them an A-/B+. The colors could be a bit more vibrant, but I have also been surprised by just how much they will pop in a good pic. Ultimately however I feel that the convenience of having everyone sitting on the couch and picking out the photos they want through the television means the minor cost/quality issue becomes inconsequential, because without that convenience those pictures might never see the light of day in any form. Overall I would recommend this unit to friends who do casual printing and want something that is very simple to use. I've even considered sending one to my mother for Christmas. While the interface as a whole is perhaps not quite as intuitive to use as an ipod, anyone who isn't scared by a cellphone or basic computer use should be able to handle it easily. It's also flexible, taking a variety of card formats and providing different options for choosing the pictures you want to print - though I would be surprised if you ever used anything but the TV out. And ultimately I think that anyone who gets it will be printing more photos than before. Finally, a couple of notes for those who decide to take the plunge. Don't count on finding the 3.5x5 paper easily, I haven't seen it anywhere. ALL of the 4x6 paper is "postcard paper" - I was a bit confused at first looking for "normal" 4x6 packs. The paper has tear-off edges on the left and right - it's micro-perforated so you wont get any rough edges, but it's a bit of a pain to tear off without "fingerprinting" or creasing the photo. Enjoy 
I just received my printer tonight and could not wait to try it out. I have had a Sony digital camera for over two years, and have only been able to print pictures via my regular inkjet printer. I decided to purchase this photo printer so I could get much clearer, better quality pictures. I love that this printer allows you to print from a Memory Stick without having to connect the printer to your computer. It could not be easier. Just insert the memory stick in the printer and you are set to go. It was extremely easy to set up, and it comes with trial paper and ink. I have only used it to print out 6 pictures, but thus far I am very happy with my purchase. The photo's are extremely clear. They look like I took them to a high quality lab to have them developed 
This printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear. I have a Cybershot T-1 camera and the combination is nice. The printer speed was quick too! I couldn't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the TV and view the pictures that I had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control. I would recommend this printer because of the easy setup, quick printing speed, and excellent quality of the pictures 
It is very small, but comfortable to use. I don't have really big hands so I don't know how a man would feel. I hate the touch mouse on the notebook computer so this is great for me, it helps me do things much faster 
This mouse is great for laptop use on the go. It comes with me everyday on the train and on buses on my way to work, and still works with no problems after a couple of drops and banging into things. My only complaint is the dimensions on this page are way off. The mouse is very small, for my hands I basically use it with 2 fingers, but it works great! 
I have used this mouse for 3 months with my laptop. Look/feel and general use are fine for short periods of time (~&lt; 1 hour). However, I am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem: Intermittently, after clicking/double-clicking, the mouse will go into a "move to the left" mode...and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen. Sometimes it will move to the upper-left. This is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable. I will often (at least 10 times in a 30 minute period) have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing. Frustrating if you are trying to click through a multi-level menu, for instance. Another example is if you working on any CAD-type or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time (mouse will move when it feels like it). It was ok for a while, but now it is annoying...going to buy a replacement. If I have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life, it gets no more than 2 stars. It could be just this one particular mouse, but then that points to lack of QA at the manufacturer end...again, 2 stars 
I was surprised how tough these little critters are. I got it initially because I did some travelling and needed something small and light. My 2 boys (3 and 5) started using it (because it fits their hands) to play games and I wasn't sure how long it was going to last and they can be very rough with it. You know little kids when they get excited or frustrated with computer games! To my surprised, its been nearly a year and it is still alive and well and they used it most every day! I bought my wife one and she loves it and I ended up getting an extra one for myself for travel purposes. Yes, it may be a little small for my hand but not totally uncomfortable and it does its job. I even used it through one complete code/programming project 
When travelling, you want it small and light. Besides, you need it to be precise and comfortable. All these features come with this handy (or fingery!)mouse. You won't regret it 
I've had it for over a month now and it works as well as I expected it to work. I was expecting random quirks here and there as I continued using it, but none whatsoever 
I'm a grad student and use a laptop every day at school. I got this little mouse at Staples over 2 years ago and it is STILL going strong! It is very compact and fits easily into my accessory pouch. You can't go wrong with this one 
I purchased this for my laptop. It worked great at first. There were blue and red lights that would brighten up when it was awake. Not anymore. The blue light completely stopped working. It used to be plug and play. Not anymore. Basically it is useless. It just doesn't work. It was used probably 30 times at the most. Complete junk. I like the smallness and shape of it though. Time to try a different brand 
Order this to try and save on money since I didnt need a whole lot of outlets, I pluged my computer to it and TV. On a full battery It was able to run for about 5-10mins with my 32' CRT tv and 19' LCD monitor + comp. Good enough for me to power down the computer, would last longer if the TV was off im sure 
I shot several hundred pictures at a wedding with a battery grip and 2 of these batteries and did not have a single problem with power 
Don't purchase this if you're expecting to get a 1500 mAh Power2000 ACD-674 battery. They sent a 1300 mAh Digicom battery instead 
With a full charge it does not last more than 10min, could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera Canon Pro1. The original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge. Initially I thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all. I'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too 
I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great. The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles. However, it is just right for me. I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate. I have a pair of Grado SR-80 headphones, and a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones. Each is a $100 conventional full-sized set of headphones, and yet I actually prefer the sound of the Sony earbuds. The only problem I have is that the cord is far too short without the extension, and far too long with the extension. (A free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones.) What were they thinking? Also, the fact that the right ear's cord is so much longer than the left's is ridiculous. Don't they have a focus group review these things? 
I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass. My pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once, and they still sound just as good as the day I got them! (I did have to glue one of the earpieces back together, though.) I thought I'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet, but these things are industrial strength 
I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones 
Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product. These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable. But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say. Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better 
I was pleased with the price, happy with the time of delivery, and so far have had no issues with the quality of these headphones. The sound quality is good on airplanes, when working out, and they do not fall out of my ears nor do they cause any discomfort 
I am a mild audophile, and I love these headphones. They have great base response, treble, and isolation. If you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop, don't get get these! You won't be able to hear a thing outside of the music 
Like I said above, I am on my second pair of these. The first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer. Believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life. These phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market. When this pair wears out, I will get some more. They are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort. You don't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on 
These are great earbuds. I have alswys used Sony DJ headphones in the past, and these are the first pair of buds I have purchased - I am impressed. For the money, the sound quality is very good - full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright. They are pretty comfortable in the ears, but it does take a little getting used to. The cord is rather thin and very flexible, but seems to be sturdy enough for most use. The included 'case' is a little tough to figure out, but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack. Definitely recommended 
I bought this and other sony headphones (noice cancelling). I travel sometimes because my work and I prefer use the Fontopia headphones because they are small and the sound quality is good. In addition, they isolate the outer noise enough good due to their design. The small case is nice and protect them from scratches... I recommend this product. 
I recently purchased an Alienware computer with a Dell 30" monitor and wanted speakers to match. I wanted very loud speakers to shake the walls when I play games or watch DVD's. These speakers are the loudest I have tried. The shake the walls and house with great sound. Some important "pro" features I really like: 1- the speaker cables are clips rather than RCA plug type- in other words, I can use my own speaker cable (I need long ones to route the surround speakers) to make it a professional installation (all wires hidden). 2- each speaker volume is adjustable. Because of my room size, i manually turned up the surround speakers volume to balance the sound coming from the front. 3- the remote is really cool to adjust volume quickly, just point and turn it up 
As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars. However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them. Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no "universal speaker mounts" will work with them. If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting. Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design 
These speakers pump! They sound great and can be used for almost anything since they accept multiple input sources. The subwoofer is HUGE though. Make sure you have space for it 
The Logitech Z5500 speaker set is one of the best deals around... You get all of the features and benefits of a dolby digital decoder, true sourround sound and a digital control unit. Sound is fantastic- You may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media player/sound card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output. The best part... It can play loud, too! Cranking it up to its full potential produces deep, rich pounding bass, without even making the amplifier's heat sink very hot to the touch! A best buy! 
this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers. But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews. i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these, but they do lack base and loudness. but overall i am pretty satisfied with these... 
These speakers are the best speakers I have ever heard. Well balanced between power and clarity. I recommend Logitechs Z5500 
I am disappointed in this product. I was suppose to write to you from the weekend. My two rear speakers just stop working, and also my remote control. I have replace the batteries, but still does not work. I don't have any other rear speakers to try on the system. Pleasy me what to do. Thank you Epiphane Flaviu 
I am using this system instead of component audio to do with my new hi def TV. i can't believe the quality of sound that comes out. I would have paid 3x what this system cost to buy it in pieces and the sound would be roughly the same. I would recommend these for whatever use you have. They rock. Literally 
After going through more than ten different manufactures of DVD+R media I have to say I have had the best results with these. Close to 100% burn rate with excellent playback on most players, except Sony, (though I'm using a Sony burner). One batch had some duds at the end of the cake and Amazon replaced the whole thing promptly 
Haven't used any of these yet, but I won't trust any other brand of DVD +Rs than Verbatim 
My current DVD writer??? NEC ND3550A I also use Memorex 16x media. zero problems*** I have one gigabyte of RAM inside my computer. Corsair makes the ram. 
I rarely write reviews but I could not believe what I saw with the "24 DVD" players and it doesn't work. All I ever use are Verbatim DVD's and I burn on both a Mac and a Windows-based unit. The Windows DVD's play fine in my Mac and vice-versa. Also, I have two Sony DVD players, a PS2, and my roomies Zenith DVD player, none of which have a problem playing the discs. If you "truly" had problems with 24 DVD players, I am wondering if you just got a bad disc. I have been burning copies of my older DVD's, this weekend alone having done 7, with not a coaster. On my 2nd 50 pack in under a month, and only have had one problem (which was my fault anyhow). Verbatim's, in my opinion, are the best media available, in both DVD-R and DVD DL 
while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players 
When I first got my Sony dvd burner I had numerous failure with burns. I tried several different brands of blanks with the same problem, big stacks of failed burns. When I called Sony to complain they suggested I use Verbatim. I did and in at least 150 burns I have no failures. So naturally I'm hooked on Verbatim. It must be the best 
I rarely write a review , but I figure I should on this one. First off, the price was perfect for 100 dvd blanks. Next, the quality of the blanks for burning backups of dvds I have, worked fantastic... although finding the right software to do the deed is tricky at first. Anyhow, I also had to clean house on a 30 gig drive and a laptop so the file transfer worked fine to the dvd's. My only problem was with the shipment itself. It came in some square box...I opened the box to find some paperbags wrapped around a broken dvd container with the blanks barely hanging on. The plastic that incased them was totally shreded and broken. Go figure! They need to work on their shipping skills. Try bubble wrap next time boys and not paper sacks. Other than that, I just needed to burn backups of dvds and get files to dvds so the item itself worked pro. I highly recommend. I don't blame Verbatim for the shipping issues... Go for it 
thats right .. not even a single coaster (as many others said) ... I did have one. but that was 'coz of some other reason ... there was no problem with these discs. I have burnt about 80 of these .. no probs so far ... cheer 
Verbatim is great. not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs. I use Nero to perfectly complement the burning process. I was sceptic when i did geta great deal (~25 AR). heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line. Excellent discs would definitely go for em. was always a believer in Ritek Ridata before these. got to get some of those RWs. 
I FIND THE VERBATIM MEDIA BLANKS TO BE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.THEY ARE COMPATIBLE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPUTER BURNERS,AND HOME DVD RECORDERS,THAT USE THESE BLANKS.WHEN YOU BURN YOUR HOME MOVIES OR DATA FILES,THEY ARE THERE TO STAY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,AND INEXPENSIVE 
This wheel does the job. It's not super fancy but you still get the driving experience. Enjoy 
I bought this for my kids to use with Nascar Racing. Controls are easily reprogramable. Nice product for the money 
Dear Seller, The price was good, The product was good, Your delivery was excellent! But it did not come with even a sample of what it can do! So what now? I plugged it into my computer, and everything loaded as it usually does, but no games, not even a starter edition. pardon my ignorance, but even when I registered with Logitech, there was no reference to an actual usuable and downloadable game for this device. Confused new gamer ( I bought this for my five year old, who is as mystifyed as I am). This product is NOT a recommend for the novice, such as myself. Just go out and buy a complete system that has all the bits and pieces included....save time and disappointment. 
The relatively inexpensive, well-designed Logitech Nascar wheel and pedals are ANALOG, a MUST for racing games like Need for Speed. Analog potentiometers slide along infinite voltage points between turn-left or right. The wheel suction cups hold snugly for a standard desktop. The pedals tend to slip slightly and may be at a slightly awkward angle, but can easily be mounted to a small, inexpensive piece of hardboard or plywood, or car floormat. You could also design a 1x2 wood slide-into-place framework. The twenty-dollar "Try Me" wheel I returned was DIGITAL (full turn-left or right), as ineffective as using keyboard arrow keys. 
I purchased this product for my 3 yr old. He loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise. It did not come with instructions, so we're having to self teach ourselves the features. Surprisingly, I can't get the vibration feature to work with his Nascar game and this is a Nascar race wheel. The vibration works for his SpongeBob game?? 
I bought two of these wheels last month and I'm about to order 2 more (I'm setting up a little company picnic racing rally). I played Midnight Run II (windows) with these wheels and didn't experience the force feedback either. However, when I played NASCAR 3 with these wheels, then I got vibrations in the steering wheel when taking turns too tight, but nothing when bumping the wall or another car. The force feedback amounts to a 'humming' vibration and is actually annoying. btw - there's an option in NASCAR 3 you have to turn on for the force feedback to work. The force feedback was just a 'nice' feature for me, but I really got it for the USB connection and table top design. I have a couple of the Interact V3 racing wheels and their 'sit nestled between your legs' design is awkward to deal with and it's too tall to effectively use them on a table. But the LogiTech wheels work great on a table top! The LogiTech connectors are a little more reliable too. The pin connector housing on the V3 snapped off pretty easily on one of the wheels. However, I do prefer V3's full size pedals to the LogiTech smaller pedals... but it's satisfactory 
I have used these DVD-Rs for over two years now and they work absolutely great. I have burned movies, games, files, everything. Haven't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the DVD players I tried them out on. Not much else to say 
This media did not work on my brand new asus burner, even after updating the firmware 
I had so many bad burns with my first spindle that I had to ask for an exchange. The new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too. Also, the edge of the disc wasn't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside. Never again will I buy Memorex discs DVD, CD or otherwise 
Excellent / flawless -- works great on my PC's Sony burner. Highly recommend. No coasters yet 
Been using Memeorex's DVD-R's since 12/2003 and their CD-R's since 2001. I have never had any issue with Memeorex media so I never bother using anything else. Not one DVD coaster created with Pioneer's A106 
One out of every 4 discs would fail on me when I'd burn to this media at 4x. Slowing down the burn to 2x didn't help either! I own a Sony DRU500A with the latest firmware. Memorex isn't on their compatibility list. Lesson learned: check the compatibility list BEFORE buying 
These are the best dvd-r's on the market. I have only had a handful of these not work, out of the hundreds that I have used. Very stable and plays on most dvd players. Highly recomend! Can't beat the price 
Use Maxell or Fuji disks. They work flawlessly 
This unit set up great. I am using it to backup my DVR and HDTV box. These components wipe out various settings whenever there is the slightest power interruption. This unit has served me well 
I've had several UPSs now for a while. Belkin UPS quit after about 3 years of work. I understand that this may be long enough, but I have several from APC and they are still working. One UPS, I think, now has been in service 7 or 8 years 
I bought this Belkin Battery Backup after a power failure disaster was narrowly averted by MS Word's AutoRecovery feature. It's worked fine at warding off power failures since, I haven't really tested how well it does what it's supposed to do. I do have some comments on usability. My wife finds the necessity to press and hold the power switch for several seconds counter-intuitive. I would like the non-battery backup outlets to be controlled by the switch so I could shut everything down for power conservation with one step 
Shipping took awhile - but considering the weight of this item I still think it was excellent quick shipping service. The price was excellent - especially since I knew the model I needed beforehand and had priced it on other web sites too. When I need to buy something - I generally loook at Amazon first now.... and seldom need to go any further. 
Power UPS! Everything you need to know. First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin 
outlets are on top of case. easy to plug in and change plug ins. narrow case width allows backup unit to fit in the space available in my roll around computer cart. Switch is recessed and on front with lightup controls. No bumping switch and shuting off accidentally. 
I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH TV NOT TURNING ON, AFTER HAVING PURCHASE A YEAR AGO. FOR ALMOST YEAR IT WORKED GREAT !!TRIED ALL SOLUTIONS GIVEN TO ME, AMAZON WAS HELPFUL WITH CONTACT INFO. IT TOOK ABOUT 2 WEEKS TRYING TO GET SERVICE, WHEN SAMSUNG COULD NOT FIX PROBLEM, IT WAS RESOLVED BY OFFERING TO SEND ME NEW REPLACEMENT, THIS YEARS MODEL. I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH SERVICE 
It's a great buy. The only problem that I have is the "DNle" won't stay on and no one can seem to tell me how to keep it on. I get a sort of cloudy look, but it's tolerable. Other than that it's great. I'm pleased 
Pros: Three customizable video profiles (movies, broadcast TV...); Excellent brightness and contrast; good viewing angles L R of center; Generous input options; Cons: Big, centered on/off button cries out for my toddler to turn it on/off/on/off. Finally put a 35Lb barbell in front of it. The biggest con has not to do with the TV but the dearth of HD content. Others' comments about broadcast TV looking horrible on HD sets cannot be overemphasized. Same for DVDs on SD DVD players. On the latter note, buy a good upcoverting DVD player ($150); the visual results were simply outstanding. Also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum, HDMI preferred; Using S-Video or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the TV. So the other 'con' is that you will probably need a new A/V receiver and cables. So to recap, if you want a good experience, you need an HD TV, upconverting DVD player, A/V receiver with component or better yet HDMI connections, and HD broadcast content (cable or satellite). This is not a cheap endeavor 
Buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the TV you will be left on your own to sort it out. Amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company, but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email (run around)!! Bare that in mind before making any large purchase, may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back 
The TV is really nice. It works easily. I have it hooked up to a cable network. My friend also bought one about a week earlier and I liked hers, so I ordered mine. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a first class HDTV. The service is quick and efficient. The picture is fantastic 
Wonderful picture quality in HD. DVD displays well too. Standard cable signal not really much difference. Would recommend this tv to anyone. Just understand that you need HD programming for this tv to really shine. The audio of this tv is ok, nothing special, but it gets the job done. I have it hooked up to a surround sound and love it 
I should first note that I am no expert on television sets, and was more than a little confused by all the different technologies out on the marketplace. After some research, and a little help from a local home theater company, I settled on this TV. If 13" of depth isn't an issue for your application, this TV offers picture quality on par with the more expensive plasmas and lcds. Couldn't be happier with my purchase 
The previous reviews are similar to mine. All one has to do is watch the Discovery HD Theater and immediately they will realize what a great TV it is, but also the picture quality is sharp,color is beautiful and the TV is not 300 pounds in weight. I enjoy my 42" Samsung DLP HDTV WAY MORE than I ever realized possible 
Unit apparently does not work with older magnavox VHS. Wasted my money 
Can capture analog video and produce cd-rom's but I expected the ability to produce DVD 
You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress). I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work. Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker. Yahoo! Perseverance paid off! Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great! To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs. I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again. Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes. My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process. The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students. Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points. Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless. Pretty cool. I'm glad I took a chance on this product! Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later. Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product: First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows: 1. S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress. 2. Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows: - all three plug into the "video out" column - all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end. 3. The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer. Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows: - "NTSC M" for the video standard setting - "640 x 480" and "60 FPS (VGA)" for video format - "DVD, VCR, TV" for video source - "Video composite" for video input Under the program advanced settings: - Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD) - CPU support: "SSE3" - Stereo system: "MTS" - Video decoder: "video standard: NTSC_M" Under properties within the program advanced settings: - Stream format: Video format: "NTSC_M" - Frame rate: "59.940" - Color space/compression: "YUY2" - Outputs size: "640x480" Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program. (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed. And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.) In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows: Under "File," click on "capture video." Use the following settings: - audio device set at: "USB2.0 Analog Audio Device" - Video input source set at: "Composite" Under Configure Video Capture Device: - Video format: Video standard: "NTSC_M" Frame rate: "29.970" Color space/compression: "YUY2" Output size: "640x480" Under Camera settings: - Deinterlace method: "Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)" - CPU support: "SSE3" - Stereosystem: "MTS" Under Video decoder: Video standard: "MTSC_M" Signal detected: "1" Lines detected: "525" Then... Give the file a name and indicate where to save it Set it for "best quality" for playback. Then "Start Capture." If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound. When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound. I know, I know -- clear as mud. But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions! :- 
I was trying to duplicate HI-8 tapes and the ADS Tech Video Express USBAV-191-EF is not a viable solution. It drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording. The installation is buggy. I ended up buying a Sony VRD-MC1 and am extremely happy with it 
Great product for getting all those old home videos on DV 
I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD. Worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi's of the four different devices I have tried. Completely unusable. The software is a trial version. Instead, buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more. Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version. It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture. Pinnacle's Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space, but the software is way too buggy 
This little unit is easy to use and ready to go!!!! Not one problem with it so far, I've been using it for over two months now 
I purchased Gigbit 3COM 3824...Extermely Bad on Gigabit...Many Errors with applications...Exchange Server, Remote Desktop, Loop In Network, Ultimately replaced it with LINKSYS...Much cheaper..but excellent performance,,,I am happy no 
AA Batteries sure come in handy around here. We have seven battery operated clocks and all seven use AA's. We also have Remote Controls and a small radio plus other items that use AA's. Now you see why I bought this 50 Pack. The expiration date on my 50 pack is December 2011 and I bought these Batteries from Amazon a few Months ago. For what I use these batteries for; they are holding up great. Priced right too. Definitely worth it! 
Here's a quick comparison for my wireless mouse: Duracell: 1 month Memorex: 2 days DO I HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE? 
Batteries made in China, good for everyday use...For $10 a good bu 
Its really works fine for my items as well as my son's toys. We both are happy with this 
I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term, risky cells. It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but I'm not willing to chance it again 
Wow, 50 batteries for 9 bux is a DEAL! And of course, it lasts as long as a name brand battery if your going to use it for small devices (cd player, clock, etc...) Get sumthing else if your going to use these for a camera 
How can you beat the price??? I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com 
Get them on sale. They work just as well as the bigger name brands for a lot less money. 
I use these batteries when I need power immediately and I don't have a set of rechargeables ready to go. I also use them as backups - so I don't get caught without power and have to pay $1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores. Unfortunately, my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set 
Excellent sound system, reminds you of being in a movie theatre. Great, Great system 
I purchased this item recently and it's excellent in all aspects. It took me less than a hour to set it up and the super cool auto calibration takes cares of calibrating the speakers without having the pain of doing it manually. The subwoofer delivers a meaty bass and the surround speakers are very impressive. The centre channel could have been powered up a bit more so that it can deliver the movie dialogues in depth, but still it does a good job. Overall, I would say it's an excellent choice when you compare the cost vs performance 
I use them on ILO DVD recorder and also for recording home movies or data disk. I have not had a problem with any of them ever. I love them! Plus, a great price! 
If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings. It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands. Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media.. 
I have been using Memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder. Not all of my recordings were successful, no product I know is 100% perfect, but the majority have been successful with Memorex dvd blank media. This 50-pack spindle was purchased from Amazon because I know I can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping. Moreover, I have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from Amazon. After trying many dvd-r blank media, I found Memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance.  
I think those who are complaining have broken drives or computers. I have been using these for about a year with zero defects 
I use Sonic burner program and these discs have worked perfectly fine. Good quality and quantity, perfectly satisfied with this product 
The first CD in this pack was damaged even before writing :(. Well, I was able to write the second one without issues. Hope the rest of them would be fine too 
I see a lot of negative reviews here, but I've been using these discs for a couple months now with my PowerBook G4's Superdrive, and I've had no problems, at least none that I would attribute to the discs themselves. One review laments Toast Titanium 7, which in my experience is a very finnicky, buggy program. I too had a number of failed burns with that program, but I was able to remedy the situation by saving my dvd projects as disc images, and then burning them later with disc utility after I had a chance to mount them and check them out. For the price I payed for these discs, if I remember right, almost half the price of a 25 pack from other companies for a 50 pack from memorex, I am very very pleased. If you're looking to play around with dvd burning, and I guarantee you you will make a few mistakes and have to throw away a few discs before you get it right, this is the best deal you'll find anywhere 
These DVD's are really good... I have yet to have any problems.. 
I've got a LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-1673S burner (Revision JS02) in my fast G4 Mac running OS X Tiger and burning with Toast Titanium 7. Although my burner is nominally 16X-capable, it only burns at about 6X in my setup, probably due to the slow (ATA 33) bus it's on. I've used a number of different brands of 8X and 16X disks, both +R and -R, and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2% -- so few, in fact, that I often don't bother verifying video DVD's anymore when burning TDK or Maxell discs. (I always verify data DVD's, since errors in those are not ignorable.) But with Memorex, I've gotten about 20% failures, including a couple of aborted burns! In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones! The Memorex discs I'm referring to have Manufacturer ID "CMC MAG, AM3". According to videohelp.com, these are sold under at least 7 different brand names. The reviews there are rather mixed, which is not IMHO good enough! I have not, BTW, have had any problems with the Memorex DVD+R discs I've tried. But I stopped using them because one of my players won't recognize the +R format 
I have used three other brands of 16x DVD-Rs and none of them have been problematic with my new (Tivo) dvd burner. This is the first brand that just hasn't worked. These discs were a waste of time shopping for, they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns, and they were a waste of money. I am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the Amazon marketplace since it wouldn't be fair to other buyers. For your information, I have had no problem with Sony, Fuji, and Verbatim 
I've had this drive for a year now and I've burned over 500 dvds. The drive is still going strong, with no signs of giving up. I've had a total of 4 coasters and they've always been the fault of the blank dvds, not the drive itself. Never had compatibility problems with DVDs or CDs and I've even used some manufactured/burned overseas. Memorex, TDK, Fujifilm, Sony, you name it and I've burned it. If you're looking for a dependable, good performance, cheap drive, look no further 
The burner works well except when burning dual layer discs. I have colleagues that also have this problem with dual layer discs when using other burners so it's most likely a problem in Nero and not the drive. 
All this has been said before but here it is again. Sony 1-8x DVD+R's with "AccuCORE" will burn at 16x. TDK 8x will only burn at 8x. Wherever you buy this buy it OEM. Save the money for a better version of Nero Burning ROM. Bundled retail software is junk. I've had mine for months now and burned most every format on DVDs and Cd's. No coasters. It's quite but you can here it run. It has a busy light. If it's on it's busy. Firmware updates for media are readily available. Present version is 1.06. You can buy this under $50 and it works great with my AMD 1.4Ghz and Windows 98SE. 
It gave me format errors out of the box.. I returned it to Tiger Direct for an exchange and got a refund instead. Not to happy about paying all the shipping costs for nothing 
Very easy to install, I'm not very hardware literate. I have used it to copy music with the cd-r and movies with dvd-r so far no coasters. It has done more than I expected and no problems. My only complaint is it doesn't have light scribe like the European models. Highly reccomend this to anyone looking to upgrade their computer 
I bought this burner for around 40$. I needed to add this for my system, which didnot have the dvd burner part and also needed to backup my information. This is easy to install, if you are going to have two drives running, then you need to set up one drive as master and the other drive as slave, the white ide cable that is allready present in your system usually has this labels, usually the top end of the ide white cable is the master and the middle point is the slave. now also connect another power point, at the same end as your previous drive, and you are ready to roll. if your computer doesnot recognise either of the drives, then you need to change the Jumper settings, at the very back of your drive, by the side of the IDE cable slot, you have another small slot whith three pairs of pins, one end of them is covered with a black clip like jumper, you need to change it to the other end, and then restart your comp. Please donot forget to turn the power off. Now about this burner, this is an amazing piece, which burns DVDs really silently. It comes with nero 6, software which is easy to use. I didnot need any upgrades of the software, the older version works fine for me. The reason i have given it 4 stars only is because it makes a funny noise when it reads my DVDs, funny looking at how silent it is when it burns them. It also will read DVDs that have scratches, and other drives wont recognise. All in all this is a very good buy for the price, if it is to be your second drive. And hey it is a NEC, so dont worry. Update 6 Months Later. This NEC burner works very well and is very silent when burning the DVDs, infact so silent that initially i wasnt sure if it was actually burning the DVDs. I would recommend Nero software for this burner. All in all a solid buy for the price and performance 
I bought this DVD burner because my friends all told me that it was a great burner, and I compared it to other specs of DVD burners without breaking the bank, and by far, this burner was the cheapest and was the fastest of all the cheaper burners I could find. I can burn a full dvd in 40 minutes, 30 minutes spent reading the disc, and 10 actually writing it. It works great with my Memorex 16x DVD+R's. I loved this burner so much, that I bought another one, so I now have two burners in my computer. I highly recommend this burner and the nero software that comes with it is great 
Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine. Careful, there is no plug-in at the back, so you can only connect MP3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack. Otherwise it's easy to use and pretty cool-looking... ideal for quiet listening, lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff 
I don't know much about audio, nor do I have a good basis for comparison. But FWIW, the system works fine and sounds good 
We were very pleased with the system. It arrived on time (it was a present) and we found it easy to use and good value for the price. 
I thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old MHC-GX250 which was a bit big for my new smaller room. But I was the MHCEC70 Minisystem is truely "Mini" and inferior in quality to the older MHC-GX250 which was around $280 and was well worth it. This system does not deliver the 320 Watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room. Moreover it lacks an auxilary and Game Sync, so you can't hook up your TV, IPOD or XBOX to it.. 
This model was intended as a replacement for my not-very-old and yet quite functional Panasonic PM-series stereo. This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night. Unfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor. Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver. Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together. Grrr. So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds. Death to Sony 
This is an awesome little system for the size. It was easy to set up, even for an electronically challenged person like myself. A lot of fine sound comes out of this compact system. The price was great and delivered right to my door. Amazing 
The product performs great. It produces quality sound and offers excellent value for its price point. The stereo does everything the manufacturer claims and it meets all my needs 
I have just purchased my 5th case logic DVD album. This is the greatest way to store DVD's 
Everyone so far is right. This is a great product to store your dvd's. You do have to trim the covers to fit. Beyond that is works perfectly. I have 3 of them. I would recomend this to anyone with a large dvd collection 
CaseLogic has set the standard for media storage, and this continues the tradition. A few tweaks are needed, however. I am certain that I will soon fill the 20 slots. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk. The graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed. Actually, I would prefer that the DVD companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around 
If you have a lot of DVDs or CDs these wallets are the way to go. I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet. For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em. For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair. Even better here on Amazon.com Enjo 
I was scepticle at first that something looking that flimsy could really hold the weight of 622 cds. The assembly was easy though time consuming. I would recommend that you use those plastic washers, otherwise if you decide to move the rods you get nasty marks on the wood. I would recommend this unit to anyone wanting all of their cds in one spot. Very stable even on carpet 
This monitor is one of the best I've ever seen. It works perfectly. The picture is wonderful. The controls are great on the monitor. This is my first LCD Monitor and I just love it. If you are thinking about it. Buy this one. It is well worth it 
i liked this monitor a lot. the picture is good. it's also light enough for me to carry. it was easy to hook up. i have had sony monitors before and liked them 
I am very leery about these flat screen monitors. However, I am enjoying the Sony very much. I bought a Pixo, and it blew out in only three months. Someone told me to get a Sony. They've had it six years, and nothing happened to it yet. So your reviews are very helpful to me. Thanks guys 
I searched and hunted this monitor for the best price for months. I first saw this monitor at Best Buy. I was so impressed with the quality of the picture. I was sold on "XBRITE", but I hesitated at the price of $399.00. I watched the ads for months, checked other retail outlets, searched other online retailers, and went back to Best Buy on several occations to see this monitor, hoping I could catch this item as an "Open Box Item".  I am very happy with this monitor. Set up was a breeze, connect, plug in, and go. When I do buy a new PC with digital for monitors, this monitor is already able to switch. The clarity is remarkable; I am using 1280 x 1024 resolution that fits this screen perfectly. I can't add anymore to what other reviewers have already said about it stats. As far as quality and service and price from Amazon.com, I give them 5 stars. I have no complaints. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for quality 
Whether you have a VIAO notebook, or a SONY plasma TV or a flat panel, or even a CRT, SONY offers one of the most striking and crystal clear images in this world. It'll cost you a lot more than brands like ACER, VIEWSONIC, or DELL, but mind you, SONY has been making TV's for a lot longer than any of these companies, so their technologies carry over to all of their displays. can't go wrong with this Japanese marvel of a company 
After reading tons of info, checking critics' recommendations and comparing monitors online, I went to check them out at a CompUSA store. After seeing some of the monitors and brands the critics like, many of the monitors appeared similar with only vague differences. Except this Sony. It outshined all others by a wide margin. There are two Sony models that have the same frame, so be sure you look at the one with the "XBrite" technology because it's very different. I have never needed the height adjustment and wires are totally unobtrusive. This was a plug and play unit, no adjustments were necessary (I changed the pre-sets, but went right back). So far, after about a month living with this monitor I can't say too many good things about it 
I have started to use this with my new gaming computer and i have found it a very nice product. I got it for $340 making it cheaper then the others and also making it a very good buy after spending so much on other things. I would highly recomend this and hope you get it for as good a deal as I did from this site 
I purchased this for my special needs son who is 4 and needed a case for his cd player. It is very lightweight and soft and has space for a few of his cds. The adjustable belt is very easy to open and close and make larger and smaller. I am very pleased to have made this purchase 
Just wanted to note that the contract is available at the top of this page. If you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I have no idea how true they are to their contract, but I read the service plan intensely since I nearly got it. Some notes on the contract: 1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money. 2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple. 3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it. 4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, "You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You." I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you. 5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will "replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY." (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.) 6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover "the elements or acts of God" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase. So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase "at our discretion" in the contract. Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale) 
I bought this thinking "Failures due to normal wear and tear", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping. However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT," is not covered. This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty. A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered. Save your money 
I have had three of these units for the past 5-6 years (one for my PC, one for the wife's and one for the Tivo cable box). We have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month -- usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours. Anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running. However they don't last too long on battery power. Just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down. The batteries wore out after about 2-3 years so I replaced them using batteries from a web vendor. Now the first battery of this second round has failed so I'm buying another round of three batteries. Hopefully these units will last many more years. 
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD. I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin, but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS 
Had mine since December 1999 but noticed that the battery failed after about 3 years, like the other poster wrote, APC didn't list a replacement at first but now they do and I finally got around to replacing it. Battery type is RBC2 for those wondering. Solid unit, having a telephone line/out and USB controller is a plus. 
This unit is my 2ed UPS made by APC. I out grew the other and decided on this unit. The USB connection is what sold me on this as I leave my computer on most of the day. It did shut down (using the included software) during a test I ran and the software as gives you a battery charge state. A must have if you are in an area that has frequent power problems. With the built in surge protection, you can't go wrong 
I have about 25 APC at my job where I am currently work for school. When the thurderstorm hits my school many time. It won't kill all of computer server and others important computer. I am so gladly to have this APC, because save my time to maintance if lost everything. I want buy one of my own personal at home which I need 
This is a great little disposable armband. I say disposable because its so cheap you can toss it if you want and get a new one. Nice adjustable band, although I can see this wearing out in the future as the band loses elasticity. Great for the gym. It even comes with a little custom fit LCD screen protector which is a nice touch. The arm band is removable, so even if you are just looking for a skin...this is a stea 
This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place. The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off. The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod. I finally just gave up on it and returned it. I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag. I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options. Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano 
I LOVE this arm band. I have had it for about 6 months now. You dont have to take your iPOD out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer. I also only use my iPOD for the gym, so its nice that this arm band provides great protection (better than iPOD's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on) as well as not coming off while working out. 
There's not really a lot to say about this product - it protects your nano, the material is good quality, it is not too thick (doesn't bulk up the nano too much) and not too thin (provides enough protection). I wanted this to go jogging with my ipod - it fills that function perfectly, the strap is comfortable. The only flaw that I have found (this does not bother me, but I know it might bother others - hence 4 instead of 5 stars), the material does act as a bit of a dust collector - if you put it in a dusty packet, it will collect a lot of dust. 
Way more affordable than what is out there. Fits ipod nano snuggly and adjusts nicely. Great for runners 
I have used this item frequently on solo marathon training runs. Works fantastic. A better buy than the Apple brand armband by far 
This armband was certainly the right price. I use it everytime I work out at the health club. I never have to remove it to charge the nano. My only negative comment is that dust sticks to the screen cover and cannot be cleaned off due to the compsition of the screen cover material. 
While the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong. For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off. Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out). The armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband 
This is definitely a great investment. I can take as many pictures as I want to and not have to worry that the stick is getting full. I have two sons who also like to take pictures and in the past I would have to take my pictures off the stick so they could use it to take their pictures because the stick we were using had less memory and got full really fast. Now I can leave my pictures on the memory stick as long as I want to, until I'm ready to download them or delete them. Everyone should start off with a 1GB memory stick because it's convenient and really worth the money spent 
The Sony 1 GB Memory Stick has tons of room for all my photos. It makes it great when you're on a vacation and you don't have to worry if you have enough room for anything more. You do pay a little more though for the Sony brand than you would a chip with another manuf 
the 1 gb card took all the pictures on a trip to hawaii, over 300 
really great - the product got delivered before what i expected 
We ordered this item to go with our new Sony digital camera. We drove all around Colorado and this memory stick was perfect for storing all our pictures. We even were able to do a 'slide show" on our computer for our family and friends after we got home 
I am very glad i purchased this and that too from Amazon, I just love the service i get from Amazon . 
I purchased this for my new Sony T-9 digital camera, and so far... all has been PERFECT. Just click it right in, and you have a GIG of space. I've been shooting pics like crazy! Throwing in a 640 FINE movie mode to boot... and still have room for a ton of pics! Love the card, LOVE the camera!! 
A memory Stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a Sony Camera - Fantastic 
I have no complaints about Amazon on this item, but I do with Sony, because their Memory Stick is not "regular" sized. It does not fit into my HP memory stick slot, so I have to use a cable connection with my Sony Camera. My previous digital had a standard size memory stick that slid right into my computer. I gave that camera to my son, who loves that feature also for his computer. It's strange to me that Sony would choose not to be a standard size in this memory stick business. It just does not make sense to me. 
I've been using this card with my Canon S400 for the past 9 months and am very pleased with it. However, about a month ago, I noticed that the write speed increased from about a second to three-four seconds per image. It's kind of annoying since it was so quick before, but other than that, the card has served me well 
First I bought a sandisk and after a month of use got damaged, I tryed to comunicate with them a lot, they have the worst customer service, then i gave up. then i bought this Viking like a year ago, and im still using it 
Your rebate submission has been received. Unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons: REQUEST POSTMARKED AFTER CLOSE OF PROGRAM DEADLINE REQUIRED POSTMARK BEFORE 09/10/04; ACTUAL POSTMARK 09/13/04 *********************************************** There was absolutely no cut-off submission deadline given, except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase. All were followed to the "T". I submitted the rebate immediately after I received the merchandise from Amazon. Give me a break, I'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10' pole. If it was not so piddling an amount, this would be worth reporting to FCC, but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops, probably for nothing, more heartache. Just forego rebates, send Viking back to the boat and purchase another brand 
I bought this card for my digital camera and I have had it for a while now. I have not had any problems with it, it was fairly cheap, and the speed seems to be fine. I reccomend it for anything except recording full 640x480 video at 30 FPS, because since this isn't a high speed card, when I tried to record at that quality and resolution, I only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow. Other than that, I like this card and reccomend i 
I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card' message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well 
I've been using this system for a couple of months now and couldn't be happier with it. I bought it for my office so I could listen to my classical CDs while I was working on my website and writing book reviews. Plus, even though it only has a short external antenna, I can get the NPR classical music station on FM which is over a hundred miles away. It's small enough to fit on my bookshelf and has great sound for the size of its speakers. Of course, it doesn't compare to my big stereo in the living room with its 4' high tower speakers, but who cares. It delivers most of the sound I need in a small space for background music. All in all, well worth the money so far. Highly recommended at this point 
It has become nearly impossible to find a compact stereo of any quality with a cassette deck and an Aux input. I mean what is with the marketing hype these days of "MP3 and iPod compatible!" All you need is an aux line input for pete's sake. My old JVC purchased nearly 20 years ago had aux in and with the help of easily found adaptor still plays all my iPods just fine. But, the belt drive on the tape deck failed twice and repairing it is no longer an option. So, we bought this... and it works, but the build quality is less than stellar, the sound is simply ok, and the remote works provided you have a clear line of sight to the unit. But all that, given the price, i think it's a good deal. Hope this helps 
Out of the carton -- everything worked as advertized, and the sound is pleasant. The speakers are the weak link. The day after I set it up to test it, I replaced the speakers with an inexpensive pair of Radioshack speakers I bought years ago: model 7s, I believe -- 4" woofer, 1/2" tweeter in a small, solid sealed enclosure of walnut veneer. These speakers are half the size of the supplied SONYs, and at least twice the weight. The improvement in sound was astounding. It transformed this package, which has a robust amp, into something worth listening to for hours on end. It reproduced a wide range of music, from a Beethoven string quartet, to Louis Armstrong doing Fats Waller, to Renee' Fleming doing "Marietta's Lied" with full orchestra -- all with surprising authority. My only concern with the main unit is that the latch on the CD lid on top of the unit may one day wear out, preventing the lid from closing. The cassette player worked without any problems. I have yet to learn how to set the timer for the unit to turn on, but the instruction book is clear, and the remote is handy and easy to use. I wonder how my main system, with Axiom Ti3s and a Klipsh subwoofer, would sound off this modest box from SONY -- or the old Jensen Tri-ettes I use in my 'study' system. Put a classic pair of JBL Lancers on this unit, and I don't think you would be the least bit dissappointed. As I said, out of the carton the system works fine, and the sound is pleasant enough, but be aware that the electronics in the box are waiting to bloom. If you have an old pair of moderately efficient speakers in the basement or attic, dust them off, hook them up, and enjoy. 
Not a bad little unit... wish it remembered where you were on the CD when you turn it off like other units I'm used to especially since it doesn't really "shut off" but goes into "stand-by" mode... Not as much power as I thought it would have for 30 watts... Would be nice if the aux (ipod/mp3) jack was on the front not the back... speaker 2 output would be nice... simple little unit, works fine so far.. 
I'm very happy with this desktop system. Great sound, great reception, great price 
I was trying to find a small unit for the bedroom to replace a previous unit. The NEZ30 model (30 watts, not the NEZ3) fits the bill. The sound is incredible and loud for a small unit. It sounds better than the bigger unit I had. The design of the speakers with the special bass produces a very rich and round sound. And that's without the DSG activated. The bass and treble can be adjusted (-3 to +3) but only with the remote. If you buy a unit used be sure it has the remote. Also I needed something with a tape player like another reviewer 
As the previous reviews had said: no frills, basic functions, good sound, compact size, clean look, and a reasonable price. Exactly what I have been looking for for a long time and could not find! 
For sub-$100, this little stereo does everything I need it to. This "micro" unit is truly small: it fits on top of our microwave, speakers and all. The CMT-NEZ30 replaced a boombox that conked out. To replace it, I wanted something through which I could play my MP3 player. That function works well. It is an simple auxiliary input, and allows me to play my podcasts at home without walking around with headphones on. At 30 watts, the sound is ample for the kitchen, and significantly more powerful than what I had previously. I didn't want something so powerful that needed to be played loudly in order to get full sound. That is not to say it can't put out some volume, however. As for sound quality, it is the very crisp, balanced sound that Sony fans have come to expect. For the wide range of music I play, the bass and treble settings cover it all. The single-CD player may discourage some people, but since it can play MP3 CDs, you can get some serious playtime out of it. For myself, my cooking is rarely so complicated that I can't stop to change a CD, anyhow. But I saved the best thing for last: it has a cassette player! (Insert cricket chirps here.) All in all, I am very happy with this unit for its versatility, size, and sound quality. It was the perfect solution for my needs 
If you're looking for bells and whistles look elsewhere. If you're looking for 3 or 5 disc changer, not this one. If you need a nice little stereo to play one CD at a time, space saving, full and clean tone - this is awesome !!! It looks really sharp, has a crisp sound. Perfect for a small bedroom or office. I am very happy with this purchase. Has a tape deck as well and radio. EQ settings are simple - no presets, just bass and treble - there is also DSGX switch [kind of like a loudness setting] just leave it ON. Very simple, well made - I like it !! No frills, great price 
This portable cd holder is perfect for me. I work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym. My cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd's. I like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch. I would recommend it to anyone 
I am currently running an online business. The expandability that this piece of equipment provides for our laptops is a great asset. 
I bought it thinking that would help me entering ASCII codes because my inspiron it's uncorfortable with some programs in spanish. But doesn't work with Alt key...I don't know why...because everything is working good. I'd like someone tell me if ther's something I should do 
I hate not having a number pad on my laptop, and this product ameliorates that situation. Good stuff 
The objective was to improve speed when I'm write down figures and doing maths... 100% acomplished... Maybe the keypad it's a solution for that kinf of stuff. I don`t use it for anything more... but that was the idea for get it. The price is reazonable... the service of amazon good as usual. (considering i'm from Chile, and always when I purchase something in amazon, always come to me ok 
He didn't send me the product that he was selling. The keypad is not USB and also it wasn't new and also it wasn't targus. I want my money back or the real product that i payed for 
Great disappointment. Plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications I own (Excel, Word, FreeHand among others) and displayed typed numbers (when it did) with extra spaces and squared characters. Should specify in the product description that is NOT MAC compatible. I'm not aware if PC users faced this problem as well 
I certainly wish it were smaller, but I guess that'd be hard to manage while retaining the feel of a normal keypad. The unit works well and adds some features that would probably be handy for spreadsheet work, like enter and backspace keys 
I purchased two ten packs of Lenmar batteries. Of the twenty batteries, only 4 would take a charge. I used 3 different chargers, an Energizer, LaCrosse, and a RipVan100. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger with diagnostics (can display voltage levels, etc., individually for each battery, it can also 'repair' batteries maximum capacities, etc. - so can the RipVan100)... None could charge the 16 faulty batteries. I sent both 10 packs back 
I was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue). I plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs. One last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo. It is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a Lenmar. Trust me 
I owned four different sets of NiMH AAs; this was the latest purchase and the first one to stop working. I do have decent chargers and never dropped them or anything. It actually ruined my day twice. Very disappointed 
I bought this to read my Smartmedia cards and it worked very well. As an added bonus it is also a nice looking product. It is sky blue and has a clear USB cord - sort of Reminds me of an IMac. Good little inexpensive card reader Note: I did't use it for any card type other than Smartmedia 
This system is not the most sophisticated or powerful you can buy, but it represents a great value for the money. I've had no trouble operating it after a reasonably quick and simple installation. A great feature is the multi-disk changer. After you've tried it you will wonder how you did without it. The ability to move from disk to disk without having to re-insert them is a huge conveinience factor. Highly recommended 
I have this in the bedroom connected to a 13" TV (it plays DVDs as well as CDs). The sound is great and it has a classy understated look. I am thinking of buying one for my office and once for the garage. 
First of all, let me say that I LOVE this stereo. Have had it for a year or two. I don't think you can do any better with this price range, and more. I highly recommend it. I have a question - does anyone know whether this stereo plays dvd's of all regions? I tried to write JVC an email but didn't get any response. Hopefully somebody has the answer! Thanks 
When I saw this component stereo system in a "Good Guys" store I was immediately impressed with the overall look of the thing. As I started toying with the floor model, I realized how versatile it was, and decided that it was something I wanted to own. Sadly, the floor model was the only unit left in the store, and there wouldn't be anymore coming since "Good Guys" was going out of business. That was not acceptable to me. So, I went elsewhere to find the same system. When I found the item on-line, for a much better price, I was sold. Getting it only took a few days, and it was delivered right to my place of work, for my convienence. What impressed me the most about the unit was the sheer depth of sound it produced. When playing a movie with grand scenes and lots of special effects, the little system did not disappoint in giving a theatrical experience in sound. Other features were also pretty cool to me, such as the LCD light. While it gave off a nice blue glow, it could be dimmed, which was a nice touch. All in all, with all the features this device has, I am certain I will have many years of enjoyment. It is a great system for the right price and truly impressive 
I needed a small system for my office. I wanted removable speakers, good sound at all volumes and a sleek look. This system filled that void. I searched for about a month to get it, and there is nothing less than fantastic about this system, even the price. In terms of sound, I can understand music at all volume levels (many cheaper systems distort at low levels) and at high volumes it sounds great. I can't use it at high volumes now that I've taken it to work, but I am thinking about buying another for my living room at home (run the output of my family room stereo and I'll have a system that sounds good in both places for parties). In terms of looks, this system is very cool. I tried to downplay it by placing it behind my desk, on the shelf where I keep my food, so that people wouldn't question it (because small stereos are allowed but not everyone likes us having them). Despite my attempts to blend it in, I've received several complements on the way that it looks. Silver casing and a sleek design are just the basics, this system features a blue backlit display that looks great! I thought that the "DVD" option in the stereo meant that you could play MP3s on DVD (a great idea for someone who wants to never have to change CDs), but in fact it meant that the system is a DVD player, and it has a video output to connect to your tv. That's a nice plus. I haven't tried the MP3 idea yet, so it may or may not support them. The stock antenna is terrible, but so are most stereo antennas. I'll buy a new one soon... The other downside is that you can't switch between presets without the remote (you can change the station, but not using presets). But with 30 FM presets, I'll never run out! The only thing that wasn't obvious about the set-up is that the disk buttons (disk 1, disk 2, etc) on the stereo are the eject buttons, not the select buttons like most other stereos. Overall, this is a great design for a great stereo. I used to work at a radio station as the engineer and now I wish I had this back then because I could blast music in my office and really utilize the system the way it was meant to.. 
This is my second disappointment with Linksys products. I have purchased this AP to use in AP client mode connected to my Netgear WGR614 wireless router. The product comes with no user manual or technical specifications sheet. After spending some time trying to set up connection I have found user manual on Linksys web site, and discovered that AP client (as well as AP repeater) modes are supported only with another Linksys Access Point. It's not compatible with other vendor's products. When I tried to use it in Access Point mode, the signal was 2-3 times weaker then my old Netgear's. I am getting Very Good to Excellent signal quality from Netgear WGR614 (36-54 Mbps) and Good to Very Good (11 to 24 Mbps) from WAP54G.. 
(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.) Major modes of operation are: 1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up) 2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device) 3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage) 4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a "virtual" cable; you need two to get the job done) A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work. I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons. 1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment! 2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is "admin". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes. 3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this 
This is a good basic WiFi access point. I've bought many. Easy to set up and use. It occasionally disconnects, but a firmware upgrade usually fixes it easily. I have many in service 
We bought this AP to use with WPA Enterprise using a radius server and basically, it dosen't work. At first we couldn't get it to communicate with our radius server at all. We resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked. Then authentication worked, but we couldn't get an address via DHCP. We couldn't resolve this so we assigned a static address, but couldn't pass any traffic over the link. Unfortunately, we found the Linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless. There only suggestion was to try different firmware. Once we had done this, they couldn't help any more. So basically, they might say it works, but it doesn't. Tried a different manufacturers AP, worked straight away. 
I bought two -- the second one after realizing that one will not work as a bridge. It plugs into the Linksys Cable Gateway in one room, and to a 5-port switch in the other room. Nothing more to say -- follow the instructions and it will work as advertised. 
I'll admit after reading some of these reviews I was a little weary of purchasing this unit, but I got it for $32, so couldn't pass it up. I was replacing a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (wireless B). In a nutshell, I followed the instructions to connect the hardware, popped the CD in my "hard wired" desktop PC, took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens (which are totally simple to navigate), enabling WEP along the way. When I was done, I fired up my laptop (which has built in wireless-G card). Network was detected immediately... all I had to do was type in the WEP key (which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup) and viola! Connected at 54 Mbps!! Awesome. The setup procedure could NOT have been any easier. I would recommend this device to anyone that already has a cable/dsl router (with a free port) and simply wants to add (or upgrade) wireless-G connectivity in their home. 
everything it says it is and it's not as bulky as the adapters with large wires strung out the back of a oval looking hub. Slick looking 
This is a great product for those who need to transfer files from a digital camera without the hasle of software. Its easy and quick. I use it every chance i get, and it fits in your pocket, what more can you ask for : 
i love the mobilemate sd. I haven't had any problems yet. It's small compact and gets the job done 
This product is not for the heavy handed after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card, and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs'. on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types 
Which turned out to be a problem for me since thats not what I wanted (I was looking for a compact flash card reader for the older compact flash cards, and just assumed that SD and CF were the same.) Luckily I also has some TransFlash cards that I am using it with and it works great. I especially like the small design with no cords like a lot of other flash readers have 
The reader didn't read my 2G MiniSD. I have another reader that does so I dumped the MobileMate and took the lost 
This tiny piece of plastic with metal contacts packs more whallop than you could imagine. Sure, memory geeks like me may find little things like this more awe-inspiring than the next...but practically speaking it is good for more than just the techno geek. What this large amount of memory provides is a way to store tons of pictures, movies, ringtones, etc. over a long period of time...and then you can "dump" it onto your computer. The other thing you can do with it is store a lot of music to play on your phone.. 
I bought this card reader to use with my SD memory cards from my digital camera and Palm Tungsten E2. Transferring pictures and music via the cables supplied with the camera and Palm is a bit slow and who needs more cables? This little device allows me to add, delete, copy and paste files using My Computer. It takes up virtually no room, and I use it between both my desktop and laptop computers. There was no installation issues - I have Windows XP on both machines and it recognized and installed the card reader immediately, without any interference from me. Last but not least, the price can't be beat 
This gizmo is really cool, i use it with my verizon phone and tranfer music and data back and forth as i wish with no problem 
I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone. I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future. 
Great value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product. 
This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price! 
This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home. It's a great card at a very good price 
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again 
This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures. When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology. I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos. I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow. Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy. Hope this is some hel 
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500. At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop. After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb. I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update. Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first 
Product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it. I am using it in an HP M425 5 megapixel digital camera. It will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound 
Hi, I'm a TomTom addict. I've been addicted ever since I first plugged in my TomTom 300 and found a new way to work. Ever since, I've relied on my tomtom to get me from point A to point B. The user interface is easy to use, intuitive and clever and allows me to find nearby restaurants, hotels or even train stations nearby. My tomtom is so great, I've even let friends borrow it at work when they have a meeting with a client they have never been to before. There are some problems: anytime I find my way somewhere using my TomTom, I can't find my way home without the Tomtom. That's why I'm addicted. It's reduced my frustration in the car and made me really happy. Thanks TOMTOM. Your friend, NEver Lost Dre 
This GPS comes with US map on the SD card and Canada map on the included CD but never the twain shall meet. By car I'm a few hours from Canada and several days from the eastern US but I can't swap out the faraway eastern US part of the map on the TomTom Go 300 for a nearby Canadian map. It's either all Canada or all contiguous US. This is a major functional flaw if you live near the US/Canada border or live further away and like to take cross-border trips. Oh, and if you do decide to swap out the US map, be sure to save it on your computer first - TomTom doesn't bother to provide a backup on the CD so if you don't first make your own backup before changing to the Canadian map you can't later get the US map back 
I used it around my city and even took it to Hawaii and it was a lot of help. People forget that the idea of the GPS is to help you find where you are, where you want to go and how to get there but like everything else, it may not be 100% correct -what really is? What I didn't like about it was the windshield mount broke so it no longer sticks on the windshield. The biggest thing is that the maps are out-dated. I live in an area where they are building a lot of new homes. Even developments that are 2 years old aren't on the map! I don't mind paying for updates - I realize that someone has to get paid to update the maps - but I will not pay several hundred dollars to buy a whole new set of maps 
If TomTom's maps fail and you submit a bug report, the nice support site sends you to TeleAtlas's site which promptly CLOSES the support request. It took two requests before I realized I was being redirected away from TomTom's site. The real problem is not with the maps (which is a good thing), but with the mapping engine (determine how to find a point on a map). I submit the request to the main support group only to have those bozos close the request saying that the problem is with the map. At this point I don't care who is wrong since neither TomTom nor TeleAtlas will say who owns the mapping engine. This stupid device failed when I needed it the most, driving in New Jersey! The TomTom Go 300 cannot map roads that are broken, see bug submission below for more information. So, why two stars? - It fails when you need it - I could scroll around the working map and find the right street, but then I need to stop in an unsafe state .. er .. I mean place and use the device like it was my trusty AAA map. - Support does not read bug reports (I want that job with zero accountability please!) Does it work? Yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map. It does take some time to find its GPS often, but its tolerable. It manages to lose signal with tree cover (seriously, I can still see the sky). Moral of this review: verify with an online map service BEFORE driving to unknown places. Defeats the prupose? No. TomTom Go 300 did find my way around some detours in NJ near Trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration (the prupose of this device). Updates: After using TomTom Go 300 for a few months I have seen more problems than I care for. I have recommended everyone in my family to not buy TomTom products. The map for my area, King of Prussia, PA more than two years out of date. It got my dad lost going to a hotel which is 1.3 miles away from me. In some areas, you will fall off the map. The most annoying new feature is TomTom alterate route functions. I am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere. TomTom wants me to take the "long" way to my destination by switching from the State Route (meaning Route 1 or Route 66) that I'm on to the another State Route at the fork. The thing is, if I tell it not to take the other State Route, the damn device will tell me to turn around!! Once I pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around. When I choose to re-run the routing software from where I am, it figures out a new route completely passing the road that I need to take. The road is on the TomTom map, but it won't take it until I get on to it. WHAT GIVES? Bug Report submitted to TomTom ------- TomTom Go 300 v6.150 The mapping engine is BROKEN. It cannot handle a road that is broken into several non-contiguous sections. The city, Pennsauken, gave several distinct streets the SAME name! Destination: 3401 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109 If you map the destination on any Internet site and scroll around, you would see that: [...] All points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road. They are on different roads by the same name in the same city. The TomTomGo 300's map actually has these locations on it, but is UNABLE to map to anything but the first OCCURANCE of Cooper Ave: 7200 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109 Trying to find the intersection (cross street) of two streets Cooper Ave and Park Ave does not work even though the TomTom's map clearly shows that they do intersect. TomTom can only see the intersection of Cooper Ave and Derousse Ave. That area has several other streets, Sherman Ave for example, that are also non-contiguous 
The Tomtom has great features. But I returned mine. First, the maps are very dated. This makes it iffy at best. It has terrific potential, if it worked. You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip. It's amazing. But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints. But I tried a local test first. I used roads as waypoints, main roads. This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes. I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database. I set up a local route, and started to follow it. It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem. But it would not go past the first waypoint. I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!. I did. Then it said take another u turn. It had me going in circles. Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would. The manual was no help. Support was no help. So it went back. I have ordered a Garmin i2. Hope this is ok. I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330. The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem. I don't recommend this TomTom. Do research. Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals. Hope this helps 
Received the TOMTOM 300 before date promised in perfect condition even though the box was dented. ( Good packing! ) I have used the TOMTOM to go from NYC to Monticello, NY and from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and home to NYC again. The TOMTOM performed flawlessly in Philly guiding me to the sites I wanted to visit and back to my hotel. I also tested it on routes I knew to see how it would route me if I deviated and it came through with flying colors. The only shortcoming is that the display is difficult to read in bright sunshine. The on-board voice makes up for that letting you know when a turn is coming up. I have a co-worker who has used this device for two years and is very satisfied. I bought it on his recommendation and do not have any regrets 
I bought the original Tom Tom Go back in November 2004. Since then, my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure. My last attempt, 10 days ago, was an effort to buy updated maps for my product. Yes, their website will offer to sell you maps, but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own, and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing, in some cases for a large sum of money. If you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call, you will be disappointed. I am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported 
The TomTom GO 300 did a great job navigating me around an unfamiliar city. I'd be lost without it for sure. I would recommend anyone getting this. It saved so much time I would have devoted to reading maps had I not had it 
I've been driving a Logitech Momo (black) for about 3 years, and loved it. Until now. This new wheel, pedal, and gearshift set is, in a word, awesome. With 900 degree wheel rotation, stronger force feedback, a clutch, and gated shifting the level of realism is unbelievable. Did you ever want to go racing, but couldn't afford the time or cost? With this set and Live For Speed, GTR2, rFactor or (one of these days?) iRacing's as yet unreleased programs you can. And after some practice "in the privacy of your own home," you can go online and race LIVE with folks all over the world. You heart WILL pound and you WILL sweat! Okay, maybe I'm weird, but at 60+ I still manage to find time to race 10-15 hours a week! And there are no long, tiring drives to the race track, no hotel and food expenses, no long waits for the other classes to get off the track, and no long drive home with a wrecked car on the trailer behind you. An hour behind the wheel is an hour racing. I have a heart valve problem and there are times I wonder if this is really safe after all 
I've had a few wheels before, but finally Logitech came out with a wheel thats simulation grade. The 6 speed shifter works great, and as for the clutch, I've found that there are plenty of games that support it, including GTR2 and Need for Speed Carbon thats just coming out. Besides the lengthy setup and steep price, this is a great wheel for a great racing experience 
First the good. The feedback is strong and prescise. Very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game. NFS Most Wanted and GTR 2 are great with this wheel. The shifter is awesome, although you do not want to beat it up. A ginger approach makes it work best. The pedals are very solid with good tension, although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three. I use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal. Now for the bad. The clamping system works, but for how long? Plastic screws are only going to last so long, and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put. There are mounting nuts on the bottom, but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk? Microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion. The shifter works well, and I am sure it will last with care. Be nice to it though. The pedals are to close together. Other than that, they are perfect. Overall, I highly recommend this wheel. For the money you can't get a better wheel 
Supposedly someone listened at the Logi office of the NASCAR MOMO discontinuation for a cheeze model of nearly equal price. That does not excuse this exorbiance. The clutch pedal is not implimented in games and until it is you are paying for a dead hand(or foot). This wheel and the transmission (hump) style gearshift is quite cool and gee whiz is the first re-action, the console buttons are only useful, again if the game doesn't back out of it. Hard Truck series backs out of any digit button or other past # 10 with in a few minutes play time as it is not designed that way and can cause software corruptions. One would usually need this for race car games, but it can be used in other driver games making it more diverse and no need to buy a separate unit for compatiblity probs. However. in as and most games do not even use more than six or eight buttons or macros at a time, the extra buttons are redundant gimiks. The styl'n Corvette style trans-hump shifter with the console buttons is nice to look at (stick a virtual transmission hump of carpeted cardboard on the ground under it for realistic effect) and the gear can shift better than a rudder(better used as a turn signal) other than that, either go down on price or give us key-to-button config in games that do not support it. Heel-toe shift is simply a way of saying shift with the clutch, how lameo is that 
Considering the Logitech website states that this product isn't available until Oct.31st, I don't know why people are ancy. Mine came 3 weeks ahead of Amazon's estimate. ANYWAY... Phenomenal build quality, largest diameter wheel available, and sturdy pedal base are among the highlights. The shifter unit feels flimsy, but as long as you don't overdo it, it should last. Its still just cool enough that they were able to pack in a gated shifter with a sequential option. I've played rFactor, GTR2 and Richard Burns Rally with the wheel and the feedback is awesome. GTR2 probably does it the best. If you're ready to step up from consumer wheels, and you can't afford the prosumer BRD and ECCI stuff, I don't think you'd be disappointed with this 
Same as everybody else, I ordered mine a couple of days back and it hasn't shipped...I want it!!!!! 
I just got my email saying it shipped and am tracking it to receive it tomorrow, so look for similar ones 
I placed my order on October 5th and for several days now it says 'the item is shipping soon' which normally means it's being packaged but it hasn't actually been shipped. I haven't called Amazon yet but might do so today to find out what's going on. I want this wheel so bad 
Received notice last week that it was in the shipping stage. It still is. Shows in-stock, but it's not actually shipping (thought he page says it is). Contacted Amazon, and they say it's shipping on the 15th, but the page still says in-stock and available for shipping. I have no idea what's going on here... They were not at all clear. Did they over-book 
First of all, let my point out that mine came with demos of crimson skies and mech assault and the full version of xbox classic arcade. Mine was new in the certified microsoft box, etc. Maybe they just updated the games. Anyways, it is in my opinion a better deal to buy the 12-month pack, but I decided on the 3-month just because I've got the 2-month trial already and didn't want 14 months built up. In the box: There's the communicator headset, a 3-month subscription card, the game discs, and several manuals on connecting to xbox live. The communicator: Purely awesome. I have read many people's comments saying that it breaks at the little clip. I grant it that the clip is thin and could potentially break easily, but it is not uber fragile. Don't be afraid to put it on. The headset weighs next to nothing and is really comfortable. It has great outgoing voice quality and great sound quality through the speaker. Xbox Live Itself: Do you have broadband? Do you have a router and a switch or hub if needed? If the answers are both yes, you need xbox live. It is incredible. Buy this or the 12-month kit if you are just starting (but don't forget to start your account first with the free 2 months. After you have live already, renew with the subscription card 
So far the item has worked excellent. It looks very nice and was inastallation friendly. I hope you keeep this item, as I restore a lot of cars and this unit works well for me, and is at a good price point. Thank You, Don Snyde 
I recently installed this unit into my 1995 Geo Prizm after the factory stereo lost its FM capabilities. Installation was a snap with the purchase of an adapter plate and power wire adapter. I left the speakers from the previous radio in the car...Boston Acoustics 5 1/4" in the front and JBL 6 1/2" in the rear. AM stations sound like the factory's FM and the FM is so clear that I hear instruments in the music that I didn't hear before. I must say that the Dual unit lacks a low end unless you turn on the "loudness," and then it is adequate. A large part of the problem is the JBL's in the back. I do not believe they are capable of cranking out bass. The stations pull in great on both bands and there are plenty of pre-select stations to program (6 AM and 18 FM)...I don't know what the local/distant feature does in this unit. It doesn't seem to have an effect. The CD player is very good...very clear and hasn't skipped when I am gone down bumpy roads and potholes. There are claims of the brightness of the radio when driving at night...well yes, there is no question about the brightness. It's a nice blue and it doesn't bother me a bit...as a matter of fact, it is easy to use the radio in the dark because the controls are easily seem and identified. A weird "feature" about this radio is that when you have it turned off, any button will turn it on...any button! All-in-all, bang-for-buck, this Dual XDM6820 is worth every penny that I spent on it. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money for a radio in this old vehicle, but I really got my money's worth and more with this purchase 
I liked the unit. it is very well built, materials and workmanship are close to perfect, sound quality is also very good. at least more than enough for a car. Mp3 player is quite fast - it takes 2-3 seconds to recognize the disk. "Random play" is not really random - the sequence is always the same and very predictable. Controls are convinient, radio reception is also very good. The only issue which is VERY annoing - blue leds highhlighing push-buttons are EXTREMELY bright. there is no way to dim them or swith off. it's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on. I had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light: 
I was purchased this item for Indian car. The installation is very simple, if you have a knowledge of installing such products then it is much more easier. It plays all song formats without skipping... AM/FM is also good. Tuner is very good. It tunes all stations. Bad: Regarding Time display. There is not time display in this item. If you want to see current time , you need ot click on DISP button 
Can't ask for more, clear sound, nicely finished, easy to use and the best part is the iPlug just plug it and you are done, your ipod doesn't get power from the 12v oultlet of the car (better for ipod's helth) no interferience like FM modulators. It doesn't get any better for the price 
I too was looking for an iPod connection for my '99 9-3 Saab that was w/o original radio/cd. I couldn't believe the price on this unit but the reviews convinced me, anyway it was fairly easy to install, took me an hour from start to finish. All I needed were 12 solderless connectors and a wire stripper/crimping tool. I've been using the unit for a week now and will agree with some reviews who say the lights are too bright. Great for daytime, way too much for night. I've considered a couple options, one was dark window tint overlays but I've decided to alter the removable faceplate provided with the unit to fashion a cover. I'll slice the FP cover in half at the hinge giving me two covers, some velcro and I'll have a cover that will work at night, set the unit how i like and place the FP cover over it using the velcro to secure. Should be a breeze to do. I owned a $350 Eclipse CD player and the Dual doesn't sound quite as good but the feature set, price and iPod connector make up for the slight difference in sound quality. The skip protection in the Dual seems better than the Eclipse. All and all a great buy. I'm very happy with the Dual 
After reading reviews on this and other products, I decided to go with the Dual XDM-6820. I got it from Amazon for $79 and free shipping. I've been using it now for about a month and have not been disappointed by anything! (I was already expecting the ridiculously bright lights from the other reviews) This stereo has so far been one of those purchases that keeps surprising me with it's versatility and features. I've found that a quick perusal of the instructions was enough to be able to use almost all the important functions: CD playback, radio station presets, radio scan, eq customization, switching between albums on a single MP3 disc, mute, external audio source plugin jack (i.e. iPod or even a Walkman), etc. The sound tends to be a little on the high and crisp end, and I have to turn the bass eq. up to 5 (out of I think 8) to get a decent frequency range. But it's not bad enough to take away from the overall value of this gem. Overall I can't understand why this stereo was so cheap! It's way better than a Pioneer model I bought a number of years back. The 50x4watts have my little Chevy thumping and I love the MP3 features of being able to pop 8 albums on a single disc and quickly switch between them. This model is a gem, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a car MP3/CD player, but who wants to spend less than $100. Buy it 
I have to agree with other posters here who praise the sound, but can't stand the bright blue lights. Performance: GREAT! It made the stock speakers in my ten year old Corolla sound absolutely amazing. Much better than the much more expensive Pioneer I installed in another vehicle a couple of years ago. Likewise the controls on the Dual are straightforward and easy to use. With the Pioneer, I had to get the manual out whenever I wanted to do something as simple as setting the clock. No way to dim those damn blue lights, though. They are so bright that you can't see the AC/HEAT control illumination at night. I tried the trick of taking off the buttons, but couldn't get them out, so I guess I'm stuck with that. 
Installation was easy. With the correct harness and knowing your speaker config, it took about 1 hour. BTW, I have never install a car stereo before. It has all the features you can think of from a mp3 player. Many small details, like able to save preset volume and prefered EQ and seperate them in FM mode or CD mode. I am really impressed. Build in 200 Watts AMP creates a solid and deep sound with my factory speakers. Of course, with a speaker upgrade and preamp it will sound alot better, but this is really pretty good with no other modifications. The i-plug is a blessing. Ever tried to play your MP3s with a FM modulator or tape adaptor? They gernerally sound really distorted and at high volume the treble will crack. The iPlug is a simple 3.5mm plug that can plug into anything from the ubiquitous iPods to the cheap MP3 players you buy from Wal-Mart. The sound is always solid with no distortion and you can tap into the EQ and build-in amp to adjust the sound. The bottom line is ~ you really can not beat the price and quality of this inexpensive cd mp3 head unit. I have no idea about the durability, but I am really happy about it at the momen 
I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Blue Logger to use with a new Dell Axim X51v (which I purchased to use with the Blue Logger). I found that I could not make a Blue Tooth Connection between the Blue Logger and the handheld computer. I contacted Delorme was told "At this time we do not offer any support or updates for Windows Mobile 5.0. Hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe." What a ripoff. Delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present PC Handheld operating system. I have also found that I cannot upload routes created on Street Atlas 2006 to the hand held. Basically I have a little electronic map with no functionality. 
i have so for used inav iguidance,mapopolis,navigon navigator 5 and The Blue Logger Street Atlas USA .out of all these The Blue Logger Street Atlas USA is the worst and inav iguidance 2.1.1 is the best .blue logger gps hardware is good but v impractical to use bcuz of its strange onoff button.... i will not recommend it to anyone....simply waste of time and mone 
I agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty. The on/off button is terrible. It takes 5 tries to turn the unit off. After 5 months of using this, the unit would no longer "talk" with the satellites. I sent it back to DeLorme. It tested bad. Now I have waited 6 weeks for a replacement that is backordered. Customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days! The software claims it will compute driving routes for you...but it will crash your PDA instead. I had to buy INav IGuidance software (which is outstanding) to get software that will actually compute road routes for me. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It has been a complete waste of money for me 
It is the year 2005. The 21st Century. We've put men on the moon. We've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system. We can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets. But we can't design a simply on/off button. The on/off button for the Blue Logger is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever encountered. Some mentally-challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button 2-4 seconds to turn it on, and 2-4 seconds to turn it off. It doesn't *sound* that difficult to do, but in practice it is infuriating, especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off. Right now the Blue Logger is sitting in front of me and I cannot turn it off. It simply will not turn off. Oh, and I've had lots of problems connecting it to my Bluetooth adapter, and have yet to get Street Atlas USA 2005 to recognize it 
I am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks ... unfortunately without success. I bought the bundle #3 (Bluelogger Street Atlas 2005 Street Atlas 2005 Handheld). The installation went fine, but I had problems in hooking up to bluetooth. I had to reset my HP iPAQ 2215 several times in this process and my IBM T30 (2.4 GHz and with 1GB RAM) was very slow ... not sure why this was. Once I got the laptop to work, I took the Blue Logger out for a trip and downloaded the trip when I returned. Well, I coudn't make sense out the data the Blue Logger logged - the waypoints were almost all over the map. This was not the route I took. I am still within the 30-day risk-free guarantee and try to return it next week. 
The first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it doesn't come with software for handhleds. That person chose to buy it without and save some $$ and then complained about having to pay extra for it because he/she bought the wrong software package. Delorme did the right thing and offered us options. I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so I'm very happy that I didn't have to buy the HH software. Just don't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it. Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me, although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option. Storing 50,000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome. I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route, elevation, etc. Too bad it is only in Yellow.. 
I bought the blue logger and both Street atlas 2005 and SA2005 HH for my Dell X50V. No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows: 1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed. 2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market. 3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH. 4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost. 5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue. I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map. I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum. I wish I had read that forum before buying Delorme software. Well, Live and Learn. 
I ordered the 2-year service plan on May 1st, this day (July 31st), I still have not recievied it. I have contacted them a number of times, and still nothing. Do not buy from this company 
I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply 
Item was received in good condition- on time and works well 
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons. 1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub. 2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant 3. It is clunky 4. Does not comke with a power adapte 
I use this in my laptop with Microsoft Street with GPS. It works great when you have multiple USB with only one port 
For the time being as I am in the process of purchasing a new computer, the USB device will work for my laptop, taking into consideration the fact that I don't have powered up devices attached to it that would draw from the laptop. 
Wasted my money for this SLOW hub... Be aware that if you want to connect your printer, scanner, ipod etc. to this device, think again 
It works well, but be aware that it is USB 1.1 only. I am not using it for my Epson RX620 scanner/printer, which is USB 2. 
I have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor. I shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose. For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.) But after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various "drives" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing. Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement. Most of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad. It is of course possible that there's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won't be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I've been through, just in case 
Cool! I can expand my-single-USB-port-laptop more flexible. From single peripheral to be quadruplet. I can plug Flashdisk, mouse, external and digital camera in same time. Worth money for usefull gadget 
works just excellent. only thing is that a longer cord between the hub itself, and the connection into the computer, would be nice 
We bought this device with the express intent of capturing old VHS tapes and putting them into DVD format. For that, it works and the bundled software meets the need. However! This (VHS to DVD) is a long and slow process, so don't kid yourself into thinking that the MPEG4 HW decoding in this box is going to make that a super-fast process. The actual "making" of the DVD movie is still very time consuming, as is the editing. I'm not so impressed with WinDVD, but my son (who did most of the editing) preferred its ease of use over the Ulead product, which was also included. We had trouble with one of the USB ports, even though all of the ports on the PC (purchased less than a year ago) are supposed to be high speed 2.0 USB. But using another port allowed the device to be found and connected. I wish there were some way to tell if frames are getting dropped. Some video was pretty choppy (and didn't look that way on the VHS) but I couldn't quite figure out what was causing the problem, and it didn't repeat on later uses. So far, we're happy we got it. If the [...] arrives w/o too much struggle, I'll be even happier 
I just make it very short! I'm very satisfied with Plextor, it is just i expected to be! All my home videos are digitalized with no problem at all. I even recorded shows from my tv and everything working as it must be! I suggest warmly to use this converter 
Excellent product. All my VCRs are dying of old age. I am converting my home library to DVD with very good results. Once you figure our ULEAD and WinDVD, conversion is just a matter of time spent running each video 
I purchased the Plextor converter on advice of NERO. They claimed that it would be compatible with their software. After I plugged it in and tried to convert my tape, the system froze. That happened several times. I wrote about this to NERO, they asked me to send them a report. I did that. That was almost two weeks ago. I am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses. You may want to contact NERO directly, however, I doubt if it will work. In future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product(s). Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the service I have received from you as I bought many other items through you. Martha Pelensk 
Save yourself time and aggravation and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought this to put home movies on DVD. Almost every time I downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video. I spent hours trying to get it right. I also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem. I finally saw a review here explaining that the PX-M402U is notorious for this problem, so I bought a CANOPUS ADVC110 and have not had a single problem! 
One of the reviewers said that this product records the video as an MPEG2 file and compromises the quality of the video because it is not saved as an AVI file. Actually it DOES save the video as an AVI file! The problem with AVI files is that they cannot be displayed on a TV set. You have to convert them into a format that can be read by the DVD player and displayed on your current TV. Thus when you want to put that AVI file on a DVD, it is converted to MPEG2. So MPEG2 is as good as it gets right now for normal digital video. For editing, you should leave your video in AVI format because editing MPEG2 causes further degradation of the video. I have used this product for about a year now and it works great. I initially had some problems with image/video quality but once I updated to the latest drivers from the companies website it worked fine. This is probably why some of these reviewers gave it bad marks; because they didn't download the newest drivers available. I got this to convert my old VCR tapes to DVDs and it worked perfectly. The WinDVD software that is included is easy to use and works great. My computer OS is Window XP. Remember to look at the most recent reviews of this product; many of the latest drivers may not have been available for the earliest reviewers. Great product! 
I really love these speakers. The fidelity of the bass is terrific (as per "Come on Closer" by Jem, say). My regular system has Magnaplanar speakers with a subwoofer, and this system gives me much the same effect as the maggies--that the music isn't coming from a single point. More like being in a concert setting than hearing sound from a box. Quibbles? The volume controls are nearly impossible to find, but that makes them inconspicuous once you've found them! The subwoofer is not tiny in terms of fitting under a desk (12" diameter). If you can't imagine yourself fidgeting with the fishbowl in stockinged feet you might pass on this item. If you think you can handle that, however, you're going to love these speakers 
This Amazon listing also suggests buying the Soundsticks along with Airport Express. If you're thinking of connecting them to the USB port of Express, Apple says it won't work. (Apple Airport Express FAQs 
These speakers are both stylish and sound great, a nice compliment to my first Mac computer 
I got the Soundsticks to use as a home stereo in a small room. I wasn't expecting superb sound quality and the Soundsticks really suprised me with the full and detailed sound they produce. Overall, the product is great value for money and the space it takes up. My only gripe is that there is no off button on them, so the only way to power off is to unplug them. I'm not sure how much power they use when idle, but not being able to power off is definitely a down side if you're energy conscious. 
I just received my Soundsticks yesterday and could not be happier with their performance. I am using them to listen to streaming audio on my PC from a radio station in Italy that plays jazz and the nuances of that style of music are well suited to the Sound Sticks. The sleekness of the design is superb as well. The nice price makes this purchase a home run 
I first saw these speakers at the Apple store, and i really liked the sound and the look. I went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them. As long as you have a decent soundcard, these speakers really are great. i have had no problem with them at all, they look really cool, they're loud, they're small, the woofer gives you a lot of bass (which you can turn down), and the sound from the speakers is clear. buy these 
I've owned several sets of the original Soundsticks, and purchased this set for my wife's new Intel iMac. As always, the sound is amazing and plentiful, with the subwoofer providing strong thumping bass, and the sticks emitting crystal clear highs. We both love music, and we often fire up iTunes on the computer in the den, and the volume is good enough to fill the house. Our friends are always amazed at the sound these Soundsticks put out. I'm sure there are audiophiles out there who nitpick the output, but if you are just a regular joe who enjoys your music and appreciates good, clear and strong sound, I promise that you will not be disappointed with Soundsticks II 
I'm not one to explain or understand most audio specs, compare systems or buy the most expensive audio components there are. This 3 piece self-powered speaker system was recommended by a coworker and the user reviews certainly helped in the decision making process. Still, I was doubtful, of course, as I love my gizmos and the price was under $120.00. What kind of quality could this be for that price? Let me tell you, I am blown away, ESPECIALLY considering the price! Roughly $113.00, shipping and tax included and my whole 13x20 room rocks! FYI, I listen to everything from Marvin Gaye, Nine Inch Nails, Acoustic to Beethoven. It plugs in via the same adapter as your headphones so there are no delays in the subwoofer like what usually occurs with the USB connected woofers. The plastic is a tough and heavy material so don't worry about them cracking under normal use, and since the sticks are tall, the base of the sticks are made of a heavy, rubbery material so they won't fall over or slide unless your head-banging on top of beer kegs. The right Sound Stick contains the + - volume adjustment sensors that take some time to get used to considering most computers have 2 other sources of volume control -the operating system's and the music player you use. I call them sensors because they don't move, they are like those cool lamps that brighten and dim when touched. Overall, if you a person who wants a nice sound system for your computer that you can hear from a few rooms away and are not sure what to buy or how much to spend, this is the way to go 
The quality of the sound is very good indeed, I would say crystal clear. They were also a very good bargain. The design is also very different. The only disadnantage I have noticed, is that they do not have a on / off switch. I use them to listen to music, classical or modern, either from my HP laptop, or from my mp3. I strongly recommend the Harman's for room use. 
The DLO Action Jacket is a must have for all Ipod owners that workout or are on the go. The armband is the perfect way to secure your Ipod when you are running or lifting. I recommend the DLO Action Jacket to everyone 
i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20 40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town. However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly. The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't. The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button. So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless. pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case 
I got this jacket a month into having my ipod. I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop. One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs. This case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine. My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out. It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction. Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface. It will protect your pod though 
This case is made of nice material. Unfortunately the Ipod fits rather loosely in the case. Also, one of the Velcro flaps on the top of the case covers the hold button on the Ipod. The case takes away from the Ipod's good looks and slightly hinders usage of the buttons. It doesn't do what I wanted it to do - stay out of the way and simply protect the MP3 player. However, the case would be great to use just for jogging as it comes with a belt and clip that hold the Ipod firmly. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Works great,good coverage. Had a small problem setting it due to changeing my ISP from cable to DSL. Called tech support, and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop. It's been two months since installation without any problems whatsoever 
We currently have the Linksys BEFSR41 4-port router/switch for our home network. It's been working great for about 4 years now, but we've now run out of ports. I did some research on the 8 port router/switch product from Linksys, but the reviews were mixed. The reviews were mixed for similar competing products also. So I took the route of getting the EZXS55W to expand our existing home network. I just plugged it into the network and it just worked out of the box. No configuration needed. It's also very tiny. I highly recommend the product 
Linksys tech support assured me that their were no limitations to this gizmos ability to route ethernet signals. Sure enough, I plugged it in and it's functioning exactly as I hoped. Our internet comes from a cable modem. From that I ran the cat-5 ethernet cable to the Airport Extreem which acts as a wireless router and it also has 1 out port for ethernet, which I connected the EZXS55W switch to. Off the switch I am running a printer (Laserwriter Pro 630) and a desk top G-4. I also have 3 wireless computers on the network and all are running OS-X. All can access the internet, I can print from any computer and fileshare between the whole lot. I couldn't ask for more 
I have nothing to report, that is, the device has performed flawlessly in the 2+ years I have owned it. I subjected this thing to almost every scenario except Mac. Read on... I used it at my office (at a major research university) where I connected, among other things, a vintage (circa 1999) Windows XP desktop, a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop with XP, two variants of the Dell dual XEON workstations running RedHat 8+/-1 and Fedore Core, an IBM Thinkpad laptop running XP, a custom built AMD Athlon 2800+ running every major linux distribution except Debian as well as XP, and a custom built AMD 4400+ dual core machine running Suse 10. Network cards ranged from motherboard-based to 0 and 4 year old Netgear cards. I used cables from 3 to 30 feet long and connected this to both a brand new wall jack and a retrofitted jack in a Cold War era building. Finally, the room this equipment operated in was subjected to temperatures from 55 F to 110 F, as my office was not air conditioned during the summer and it was colder outside at 100 degrees (the above computers made a lot of heat). We had major power outage/surge problems which didn't faze this thing one bit, but were able to ruin more than one expensive APC UPS unit. Oh, and I downloaded at least 100 GB through this card during this period 
this little baby is just hook up my desktop, wireless AP, wired router together it just works, nothing else tips: if you'd like to use overseas, buy nokia AC adaptor (auto-volt model), it just works with nokia phone charger that's all, no question aske 
What else do you need to know? You plug in your PCs and a cable to your router - and go. I used a Netgear hub for years. Replaced it with this Linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately 
I have other linksys routers and switches in my house and this works great in conjuction with them...I have never even had to power anything off...the data flows nicely and smoothly 
The product works perfectly. The only problem is, the manual only includes directions for the most common setups. To use one port as an "uplink" to a router, for example, you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled "1" and then leave port "2" open. The directions do not state this, and I had to call Linksys to get it to work. Other than that, it is fast, reliable, and small. Perfect 
Installation and network set-up was a snap. The fifth port is really the upstream connection. So you get four clients, not five 
Purchased this product lookig for a switch that allowed me to connect multiple systems to my home network. And it does that function exceptionally well. I had multiple printers PC's to connect, and this switch handled multiple connection speeds flawlessly. Stylish and extremely small, it fits on my desktop without taking up very much space (approx 4.5" wide x 3.5 inches deep). All cables and connectors are on the back. The front panel led's for each port display link/act, Duplex, and connect speed. The only thing that needs improvement on this switch is the "user guide" included with the product. There are 6 ports on this switch.. ports 1-5 and an 'uplink' port. But use of the uplink port disbles the use of port 5, leaving 4 ports for your peripheral devices. This is a bit confusing, as the device is advertised as a 5 port workgroup switch. A quick trip to [...] downloading the 'quick-start guide' (which was not included with the product) did a much better job of explaining the use of the uplink and 5th ethernet port. Overall, buy this product if you need a small switch for additional devices. Can't be beat for the price, in my opinion 
I purchased this printer with the intent to use it for both photo printing and regular text printing. Photos look great and print relatively quickly, but I had a problem with white streaks when printing text. I ended up calling Canon support and they sent me a new printer head for free since the printer is still under warranty. I've had no problems since. I give the printer a high rating mainly because I was very satisified with their tech support 
I have had nothing but trouble with this product. no matter how many times i have dowload new, or older, drivers, the installation is never complete. their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem (though they have tried). i will not spend money on another dlink product 
My brother has the Netgear WG511T Super G 108 PC Card for his notebook and it works great. So after I thought my Dell notebook internal wireless chip died, I decided to order a notebook adapter for it. Instead of getting another Netgear I decided to go with the D-Link DWL-G650 Cardbus Adapter 108Mbps - my first experience with a D-Link product. The G650 works great - plugged the card into the adapter slot, turned on the notebook, 5-10 minutes configurations and WOLA I got on the internet. The card works flawlessly without any signal dropped or any compatibility problem with my Westell 327W router. I notice the wireless signal is stronger and the connection is faster than the notebook internal wireless adapter or the WUSB12 Linksy adapter which I used prior to obtaining the G650. The G650 supports WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK security encryption and comes with an intuitive and easy to use configuration utility 
I couldn't find this adapter locally, so I turned to Amazon.com. Naturally I found it. The price was right, I received the advertised rebate, and the product works as advertised. What more can you want 
All, I Have used this card to connect to various routers and it works well. The Extreme G mode is problematic to enable sometimes. New drivers are available, make sure you down-load the right one. D-Link how about having an automatic update command ?, instead of letting the user figure out which card version he has ?. / Bria 
Install went smooth on my W2K/dell inspiron notebook. Everything worked fine for 24 hours then it just stopped. Worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere. This thing is junk. I'm sending it back 
From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal "automatic" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2. So I called back again. And again. And again. Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person. Install from CD. Reboot. etc. It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort. I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card! I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650. Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news. I give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless. Back it goes 
The main reason I got this card is because it working in Linux (It has an atheros chipset), and it delivers. It works great, and the range is awesome. For Windows users, it works great in XP as well. Overall, I am very satisfied with this wireless card 
My setup: - Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip) - Win XP Pro - D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna) - Enabled the WEP feature I unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in. Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing. Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn't 'see' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card. This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers. The CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date. I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I've never had a problem with D-Link's website (or customer service, while we're on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link's site. Either way... install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates. Be sure to enable the encryption feature. If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can't go snooping through your stuff. Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information. I've had no problems with my current set-up. I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up-to-date 
I decided to dust off a 5-year old laptop (Winbook Z1) the other day and install Ubuntu on it. I selected this card because of the Atheros chipset. I can't believe how easy it was to get it working. I plugged it in, installed Ubuntu and the new OS recognized the card. With in minutes I was on the internet, thanks to my neighbor's open WiFi. After a few hours of reading some wiki's and messages, I had WPA running and my "new" Linux laptop was on my network. Piece of cake! Great card and great chipset 
This D-Link wireless 802.11g wireless AirPlusXtremeG adapter is amazing. The first amazing thing, is that it seems to lose your connection all the time. This seems to be because of some problem D-link has with "Authentication". If you want yours to work, turn off authentication. Once you have it running reliably, it is amazingly fast. I run on a cable modem and get about 1.1 megabytes per second on a wired connection normally, and yet I have exceeded that with my AirPlusXtremeG (about 1.15). My point is that it works like a wired connection without the hassle of wires, but with the added hassle of needing to set it up EXACTLY right. This doesn's seem to be a problem if you don't use security, but with security, be prepared to visit at least one forum for tips on set-up. I recommend [...]. They have many people who are experienced with this adapter and the routers that are used with it 
This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices 
This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
PROS Small Cute Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup. USB 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well. Runs cool. CONS Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them. The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated. Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough. Overall good value for price 
This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs). It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer. And I still have 3 more ports. And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub. It does what it says 
I have been using the Sansa mp3 player now for almost a year. It's a great item, especially for the price. Was very easy to download my music and set up. I purchased a better brand of earphones, seeing I would be using mine mostly on an airplane. It holds more than enough songs. I am going to purchase one for my granddaughter for her Christmas present this year 
As you have read other reviews, the earphones could be better, sometimes you will hear music out of both, sometimes one or the other. The only issue I have with it, is if someone downloads music on to it with another computer, you cannot pull the songs off with your computer. Maybe I am missing something or doing something wrong, but over all it's not bad. 
I purchased the Sansa (512MB) player for a hinking trip and I have to say it works GREAT. The only complaint that I would have is that the unit is a bit bulk for todays standards, but not to bad. If you are looking for a no-frills MP3 player than this unit is a great value! Plus it comes in larger memory sizes and a built in radio to boot! The single AAA battery that the unit takes goes a long way too 
I have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that I did. Or else they wrote their review too soon. I bought mine in June 2006. It failed before the store warranty ran out. One down. The replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and wouldn't boot. Two down. Sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free RMA. That one also failed. Three down. They replaced it with both a m230 AND a 2GB c150. The c150 hung after about 2 weeks. Four down. I have been using the m230 for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the c150 replacement arrives. I have gotten quite good at the RMA game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or I get one of those that other people rave about. I don't think I'll buy another SanDisk - unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty. I suggest that everyone with a failed m230 to exercise thier warranty rights. Sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products. 
I purchased SanDisk about 2 months ago and so far I am very satisfied with its performance. I was looking for a chepear alterantive to Ipod as I am not an avid music listner and SanDisk was the just the right product. Loading music on it is real simple using Windows media player. Battery life is excellent. I also use it to tune into FM channels while at gym or when I want to catch up with days news at work. The FM reception is quite good for something this small without an antenna. I even have dropped it atleast on three occassion and so far it seems to work just fine. Touch wood !! Overall a great product for its price ! 
this is wonderful. I really like it. very portable and saves alot of songs 
beautiful electronic item bright colours easy plug and play 
I HAVE ABOUT 5 MP3 PLAYERS. SO FAR THIS ONE IS THE BEST. THE BATTERY LIFE IS EXCELLENT. HAS PLENTY OF SPACE FOR SONGS.VERY EASY TO USE. 
I will buy an IPOD in due time, but for right now, the SanDisk Sansa is the perfect one start off with. I didn't want to spend a lot of money for an item I never use before. I just want to listen to music without carrying cds/cd player and the fancy stuff (examples: video viewing; combination cell phone). The MP3 is easy to program your music (make sure you have Windows XP on your desktop [computer] or laptop). This player is also a recorder and has FM radio. The items that come with this are instruction booklet, mini cd to set-up on computer system (I was able to program music without this cd), plastic cover, velco strip clip-on, earphones, and the connection cord (USB). Simple and basic, this is the one (PS because the SanDisk Sansa doesn't look expensive, pickpockets and theives are not trying to to steal it like an IPOD). 
I just got my mouse today I was ecstatic about the performance I had initial problems installing the mouse but after I unplugged it and plugged it in again the problems went away. I have to agree with my other comrades from this site this is the best mouse for the price and I have no problems whatsoever except for the look which I thought was the result from damage from shipping but it was designed like that so I have no complaints 
I had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it. It had gotten very good reviews. Ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some. Highly recommend it 
The mouse is perfect for games. I use it to play ET and is great. The software provided by Logitech is configurable in all ways 
I was using a MX510 prior to getting this. There is a slight upgrade in performance from the 510. The ability to adjust the sensitivity on the fly wasn't that useful. It was hard to adjust to the different levels and it would change the sens setting in game. So, I set the mouse software to the highest level and adjusted the in game settings to where it felt good. The biggest difference I felt is it's easier to make longer range shots, I'm sure because of the higher resolution of the 518 over the 510. 
after few months of using it, it started to lag badly, and the scroll wheel stopped working, I'll never buy logitech mouse again. 
Alright, I got this mouse to replace the shoddy touchpad on my laptop. This thing is certainly worlds better than any touch pad, lol. What made this mouse appeal to me over any other is that the traditional Logitech shape of it is very comfortable to me, the internet navigation buttons are very conventient, and the high resolution optics (that you can switch on the fly)- since I use my laptop for playing games. I'm a fan of the G5 gaming mouse, and after using it for so long, I just can't go back to a normal resolution mouse without cringing. The MX518 provided a cost effective alternative over the G5, since I would be taking it around with me, it would matter less if it got broken in transit or solen. Also, the button layout on my laptop is different than my desktop keyboard, so I wanted both the forward and back internet navigation buttons. My only gripes are mostly that this isn't a G5, lol. There's no DPI indicator, the on-the-fly resolution buttons aren't ergonomically placed (the forward one feels like it's a mile away when you try to press it), and as a user of wireless mice for so long, and a fully weighted G5, I like heavy mice... And the MX518 is just too light for me to really feel natural with it. I hate to say it because the mouse performs great, but it just feels cheap because of how light it is. So, as a portable gaming mouse, I give this a 4. If you're looking for a cost effective gaming mouse, or something hi-res for graphics design, this is a good bet. But if you want to go all out, buy something higher end because you will be more satisfied with the higher end product. 
It's cool to own one.. ;) .. i'm a die hard gamer.. though i've not had time to serioulsy exploit its high resolution.. just using it in with default settings is kickass.. Buy it only for games and all... for desktop use there are better looking less expensive options. 
This mouse plays great for my games like CS Source and 1942. It is real nice to be able to change the mouse speed in game. Which helps a lot if your playing games like 1942 and you need to go from first person to flying a jet. However the reason I give it a 4 stars is that after playing for a few hours the mouse's design is such that it has a sharp bend right where your right ring finger rests and it can get to be hurting, especially if you play a lot of FPS type games where your holding and moving the mouse constantly 
I've gone through about 6 different mice, and each one had their pros and cons (mostly cons). I finally found the MX518, and trust me, you don't know what you're missing until you've used it. *Edit: how did I find it? On SK-Gaming, there are tons of threads about "what's the best mouse"? This mouse came up so frequently that it seemed like a no-brainer. This is the first time I can use a mouse and never have to worry about unexpected friction or hiccups. It controls with extreme precision and ease. At first, it was a little hard for me to get used to the shape and size, since it feels different from other mice I've used...but once I got used to it, it's flawless. I am also a pretty avid gamer, and since I got this mouse, my performance has gone up noticeably. In fact, that's the reason I got this mouse to begin with: my biggest weakness in-play was my inability to consistently click quickly on small units in battle. With the MX518, those kinds of dumb problems go away. Another thing I love is that even if I used it for hours, my hand feels completely rested and fresh. No more taking quick hand breaks, stretching it out or what not. It's also very easy to customize the speed and feel of the mouse using the software. I've read some complaints about it, but I can't see any way to improve it. Coupled with my Steelpad S mousepad, it's so much more fun to get on the computer. Like upgrading car audio, you really don't know what you're missing until you get rid of your outdated junk and try the best 
I am very happy with my purchase. The Ipod is so expensive and not nearly as efficient. My sister has one and I have 3 times as many songs on my bean. I have found that even dropping it several times, im clumsy, that despite what I originally thought it has withheld very well. I do not like the fact that you pretty much are forced to use sony software but it is quick and easy to use 
Short and quick. Software is easy to use, but because Sony uses ATRAC, you can't play the songs on another program (Windows etc.) you downloaded or saved from a cd to the SONY program. But the program is very easy to use. The player itself is very small (including the buttons). I purchased it strictly for the gym and long plane trips. It hold a ton of songs (500+) Why you need more that that I don't know. It also has a FM stereo receiver, so it is cool as well. In total, it is compact and easy to use. Perfect for the gym, running fanatic 
Great MP3 player, but the earbud set that comes with it is lousy. 
I purchased this item initially because of the price, compared to the IPOD's. I LOVE it! My husband has the video IPOD and his battery needs charged every day. I have never had to charge this MP3 player yet! It goes for 50 hours- I ordered the mini sony speakers for it so I can listen to it at work on my desk or anywhere. The only downside is that Sony quit making the armband for it so I am having a hard time finding a holder for it. It fit my needs perfectly 
I use it when I jog/walk and it really keeps me in stride. My only problem is that Amazon does not have the arm bands but I hope that they will have some in soon 
Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it. As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly. I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste. As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money. Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that.. It is absolutely infuriating 
The bean is small, battery efficient, and has a nice overall look to it. Thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product. This is NOT an mp3 player, it is a TRAC player. You have to convert all your mp3's into TRAC format before the player is able to play them. You also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your HD....this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online. Another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has. Just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds, imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take. If your looking for an mp3 player that lets you just drag and drop your fav mp3s into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you. This device is the Stalin of mp3 player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs 
The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses. The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set. The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time. It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket 
I just ordered the second one for our family. It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould. They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use. The software is simple. The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time. My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have. Mom loves that they're affordable 
This is the greatest little MP3 player!!! The sound is great (good bass), the size is very convenient and everybody who see it, wants one. It fits in a pocket, has an armband option or a key ring option, even little speakers as an option. I've taken it on so many trips. There is a caution though, even though the software is good for Windows Plus or better, you can not download from the web unless you have Windows XP 
Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library. I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1 
This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what "hold" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use 
Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment 
I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected. Pay a little more and buy an IPOD. It interfaces with PCs and Macs equally well. 
For those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful. Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc. It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one. One of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section. I record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iRiver. For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier. You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly. I've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on. Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show. Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show. I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results. A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products. The single AA batter lasts a good long time. Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low. If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved! The negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive. Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer. I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file. But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another. Also, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way. I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes. I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button. After so many presses, it's starting to wear out. But it's still working reliably. I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention. I have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great. I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it. Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs. I'm quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future 
I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio. The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty. The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again 
It got to me quickly, even before the estimated arrival date, in perfect condition. It blows away my last MP3 player. And best of all, Microsoft and/or Apple don't have their hands in this device. No playsforsure. No i-tunes. That's the best part. I pity all of you with i-pods and playsforsure mp3 players. You'll never know what it's like to not be a corporate lacky unless you get an MP3 player like this one. It's worth the price 
I had this exact iRiver and when I loaned it out, it got lost. So he offered to replace it with even a "better" mp3 player that would show photos, etc. I asked for an exact replacement because I love everything about this mp3 player, it fits my needs perfectly. The features I love are that it has both voice and radio record and you can also record from your stereo or cassette or whatever audio source using the line-in feature. It has tons of space more than I've ever used, and the small size and sound quality is great! I have seen some people write that they didn't like the buttons or had problems with turning it off and on accidentally, but I personally have never had that problem, as long as I slide the hold button over to the lock position. I like that it gives a cord to hang it around my neck, or to put it on my arm.. however I rarely use the armband. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because you cannot view photos on it, even tho you can store and transfer them. I personally don't need that feature, but others may prefer it. I Love my iRiver 
Very good MP3 player, can do everything you need, good for sport, joging. The only thing I miss a little bit is RDS feature. Also if you upload songs on it, you can download it back to PC (e.g. to friends PC), so can't be used as a USB key (well, i guess it's not the main feature, but would be nice) 
This player is great all around. Small compact size with sport arm band included makes work-outs a whiz! The only draw back I've found so far is that is doesn't play .wma files. The sound through my upgraded sony headphones is awesome and equalizer can be set to your desired mix. The battery lasts at least 1.5 weeks with daily use. LP Chicag 
I'm very pleased with this mp3 player, it may nota have a very big storage but it seems to be enough, of course it depends of every person, I think it's better than any other player of 1 Gb, got FM,record from almost any device, uses AA batteries, it's got a great sound. The only con, is that it is not recognized as a removable disk, it needs the driver! 
I wanted a non-iPod digital music player, and found this to be a terrific option. It plays a number of different formats, and includes a lanyard, which is nice when commuting on the train, or for plane travel. I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life. The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy. I have also enjoyed the built in FM tuner, and have not any trouble with reception, even on a moving commuter train. The sound quality is very good. I've been using 128 bitrate MP3 songs so far. The software for transferring music is pretty easy to use, although I did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected, which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue. The included earbuds aren't the most comfortable, especially since I already lost the foam padding, but I will probably get a better pair anyway. They do sound good though. Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them. A little hint: One thing I did not like was that because of the location of the on button, the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket. To combat this, simply turn the Hold on. The unit won't turn on accidentally when it's on 
I purchased one of these when new back in 2004. The unit has worked ok for me, with the main quirk being about once every hour or two, I go through a 3 - 5 minute period of bad reception, presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another. I was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak, but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from Crutchfield. My main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money, which have replay options and better displays. I would consider those options before purchasing this unit 
For the longest time I really didnt think $12 a month was worth this kind of radio but after buying the sr-2000 and getting it all hooked up in my car I soon changed my mind. Biggest thing for me is hardly any DJ talking, they really keep the music going. I noticed on a couple other reviews this was not the case, I listen to only the rock stations so I cant comment on other stations. I live in the Seattle area and using the FM modulator really sucked, every station had static. I found an audio input cable online to fit my car stereo for a direct connection and oh man what a difference!! Crystal Clear! I did have to play with the bass and treble a bit to get the best sound and since I have a sub-woofer I used the fader a couple of clicks to the front (away from the sub) and really got it sounding great. It doesnt sound as good as a CD but much better than regular Radio. So I bought another car kit and I have the boom box for in the house. I did notice the unit getting a little warm but nowhere near hot 
I purchased this receiver in December 2005. It worked like a champ until February 2006 when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal. The unit works for five minutes from cold start up, then the audio cuts out. Display still shows program info. Being an experienced PC user, I turned the unit off and back on, repeatedly. The message "Acquiring Signal" displays permanently, even though the Antenna Aiming screen shows full SAT and TER signal bars. My best guess is that a ROM or RAM chip cooked. This unit runs hot! JVC has been less than helpful. It sucks to have to landfill a $100 piece of hardware, but no one will touch it. It's my last purchase from JVC. Glad I didn't purchase the Sirius "lifetime" license 
This Unit performs well, both in the car and home. It performs best at home as you can plug it right into your stereo vs. using a unused FM frequency. This might work ok in rural areas, but in urban areas how long is the FM frequency "unused"? In my experience living in Chicago, not very far. then you get static and fumble to change the frequency to another unused station. Plus you have this thing hanging out from your dash, very noticable expecially to theives so it's then one more then you have to remove and hide or take with you. If you want Sirius in your car, invest in a head unit and be done with it. This unit works great at home and if you get an extra kit, you can take it to your office and hook it up there. It has a remote and I've had no problems with it whatsoever at home. Like I said, for the car I ended up getting a separate head unit and would advise people to do the same 
I think this is a very good receiver. A number of people have complained about issues with the wireless FM Modulator and the static that is causes. I would say that there is some static at times, but most of the time I have not had this issue. However, I will clarify that statement, by noting that if you are traveling long distances, you most likely will have to switch the FM Frequency a few times during the trip (In my case it was a two hour trip from Sacramento to the Bay Area) as the station you are set to will likely not be free for that entire time. However, it is very easy to switch the frequency, so I was able to adjust it without any difficulties. As for the receiver itself, I like the compactness of it and it does not take long to figure out how to go through the various menus, save stations, etc. I did not care much for the suction cup that is part of the car kit. Although it worked fine on my car window, I really didn't want it there, so I actually just use the cradle and place it in one of my cupholders, but this is a personal preference. I would definitely recommend this receiver to my friends.  
First of all I thought Sat radio advertised " Commercial Free radio" was that. IT IS NOT AT ALL!!!! In fact I spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials. (...). They claim they have nothing to do with that. So this is a good buy IF you want another radio player WITH commercials ( A lot of them ) and to pay for it. I got this because I was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much. Well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing. So keep this in mind before you buy. 
I bought the boom box and the car kit. The FM Modulator has a much better reception than when I have it in the boom box at home. Unlike others, I have perfect reception with the wrieless modulator..at least for now. I'm going ahead and buying the home aentenna to get a better reception for when I use the boombox at home. All in all, Great buy and I can't wait for STERN 
I got this for hubby and me over the summer. We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it. WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor. We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter. I did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next, but i don't think anybody can improve upon that. I had the same problem w/ my itrip. We chose sirius for several reasons...i liked the classic vinyl station, my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007. The only problem i had was i couldn't read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on, but i didn't give them less than 5 stars because of this. this is the way to go, plus it has a suction mount, not a permanent mount. also, if you look on ebay, someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!! definitely go satellite, the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations. 
I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good. I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string "telephone" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly. The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly. I returned the receiver and both kits the next day. 
This sandisk realy works to save a lot of information in one stick. It's very handy. Thank you 
This was the first flash drive I bought, and I liked it enough to buy a second one. I've since given both of them away, as I am using a 4GB other brand with a retractable plug in. However, I'm buying a few more of these right now, so that I will have them on hand to give to student advisees who really need one, as they are so inexpensive. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5-star rating is that the caps are easy to lose, altho each drive comes with two extra caps, which helps. The slim line also makes it very easy to carry or store, and it fits easily into USB ports that might be a tight squeeze for other brand flash drives. 
Works good, small, and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it, though slightly costl 
It's little. It holds a bunch of data. It's so easy to use even my copilot can understand it. It's the perfect way to transport lots of data in a really small package. Throw those floppy disks away forever! If North Korea could make missiles the way SanDisk makes flash drives, we'd all be in deep kimchee 
just the like the reviewer below, i accidentally put my cruzer through the washer...AND the dryer. i pulled it out after my clothes finished drying a i was SURE i had firstly waterlogged it, and secondly fried it. when i got to work and plugged it into my computer it started right up. no problems whatsoever. i don't know whether or not it would survive it i did it again, but for this one time, it performed brilliantly. thanks, cruzer! 
I've had this device for two years. Just today I sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry (not on purpose). The thing still works!! I will not, however, try sending it into the dryer though beause I'm pretty sure that would fry this thing 
What else can I say other than I'm impressed! Thank you everyone for placing your reviews here that helped me to decide on this item for data storage. It was hard for me to believe something could be so quick and easy to use, but now I'm convinced 
Very portable, comes with three different colored caps and a lanyard. Easy to use, just plug into USB port and save your data. Shipped quicker than expected, cheaper than local store, no shipping and tax. No complaints. 
I have had no problems with the drive. I like the small size 
I haven't had the chance to use this plan yet...but I believe it is a good price for the item that I bought, and I trust that if it does what it says, that it is a good thing 
I purchased for about $8 the 1-year Replacement Plan for Electronics Products on 07-06-2006 and after one call on about 08-06-2006 to the seller I still have *not* received anything. --John 
Replacement plan here a month before product finally receive 
First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself. I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it: (1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung. Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond. I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time. (2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well. Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close. On the 3rd attempt it actually did work. (3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk". I consider it item a waste of money 
Absolutely fantastic, my recorder stopped formatting my DVD-Ram disks. I had used the recorder approximately 1 yr, After using Maxell's DVD cleaner disk, all is back to normal. Great product even a simpleton can use it, follow on screen instructions and you are home free 
I've had my dvd player for about a year and use this a lot. Haven;t had any problems out of my dvd player yet 
D-Link's 7-port hub works perfectly -- you plug it into a USB port and it's ready to roll. It's that simple. 
No matter how many USB port I had, I always seemed to need more. I had ports on my computer, more on my monitor, even two on my keyboard, and still I needed more. After researching a number of hubs I chose this one and it is great. I am not good at the technical workings of a computer, so I was worried that the installation would be hard or that there would be conflicts with other hardware. Nothing like that happened. I followed the set up instructions; it took 10 minutes at most, and I was in business. Right now I have four USB devices plugged into the hub and all work just as they should. I have not had trouble with anything I added to the hub. And miraculously, I have three open ports to use later. This hub does exactly what it should with no fuss or bother 
I purchased this hub back in September. I plugged it in and I'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment, I've had no problems. It doesn't take up too much room even with 7 ports. My only complaint isn't with Amazon, it's with D-Link. After I sent in the rebate info, I got a card from D-Link saying my request wasn't valid because I hadn't purchased it from the right store. But I called them, and in about 10 minutes I had the problem cleared up and had my rebate a week later. I HIGHLY recommend keeping copies of all the rebate info, just in case.. 
I got this hub to deal with the overflow of USB 2.0 devices I have been accumulating. It came promptly, the rebate was great, and it is working beautifully! I really recommend it 
This hub has worked exactly as anticipated. I've had it for a month or so now and it is hooked up to my laptop. I've got a Wireless Mouse, Epson Printer, iPod, Fuji Digital Camera all plugged into it. It performs amazingly when syncing my iPod. I even had it unplugged from the power source and it performed without issue. I was hesitant to purchase due to some of the reviews but it has been perfect for my needs! 
I work with a laptop computer and I have 3 external harddrives to backup my data, other than that I have several USB devices. I have used all of them at the same time, this hub works perfectly, and it just takes one USB port, I had one before that used two ports but this one uses only one, giving you room for another device. If you work with a lot of USB devices... this is your produc 
I previously attempted to use this device with my Mac Pro. I run the machine with Windows XP and Mac OS X Tiger. With Tiger, the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my Aluminum Cinema Display. Simply unplug the D-Link hub, and the machine happily goes to sleep. With Windows XP, the machine does not recognize my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000 until I disconnect the keyboard from the hub, then reconnect it. Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub. I guess I got what I paid for. A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30. I have reverted back to using my 2x4 Port "hockey puck" style Belkin USB 2.0 Hubs. No problems with those 
I bought this tv for use in a computer room / kid's playroom and it works nicely. I looked at several similar models and was drawn to this one for the price and picture quality. I do have two complaints. My Dish Network universal remote won't operate the tv. When I called Dish Network they said that it couldn't be programmed. My other complaint is the sound quality. It is really bad. I ended up buying some Bose computer speakers and they plugged right in. A VAST improvement. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase 
I am a dentist who uses these monitors as tv's for my patients to view while having dental procedure done. I have been very happy with them. There is a headphone jack, which I use for patients who don't want to hear the drilling. I've only had them for about a month, but so far they have been great. 
Guess you can sometimes pick a good one over hundreds of bad ones... I might say I was lucky.... or for the price this litte LCD is worth the price paid... This LCD is filling 2 pairs of shoes very nicely... It's used as a Kitchen TV and used as a computer monitor.. Very satisfied with the TV picture.. Very clear and sharp.. Great picture.. good back lighting, not dull or dim as some other LCD's I've seen... Sound is OK but a little thin for my liking so I added some cheap amplified speakers which really helps.. Great as a computer monitor also.. Just as clear and functional as my high end HP monitor.. refreshes at 60HZ with no issues.... Would I buy again.. or another... perhaps but I would test it out before the purchase if at all possible... as there are some bad apples in every bunch.. Overall my purchase of this LCD TV was a complete success for my needs.. 
I have no clue what this little thing is about. Dummy me thought I bought a nice little tv, but it reminds me of those little cards you'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand, the image changed. That's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show. You cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated, say, 15 feet away from you. The other person (or you) gets a foggy image, or just dark shapes. Up close you see hardly anything. Buyers beware: this is not a working tv. One star for the batteries in the remote... 
At my house, during rain storms, there will often be a quick flash of the lights as a branch somewhere falls on the power lines. That type of event would always cause my PC to turn off, and I could loose quite a bit of work or even problems on the hard drive. This little device has keept that from happening for some time. I am very pleased. The battery that is in it does not keep the best "time" estimates for battery life, but knowing that the short spikes or loss of power will not cause me issues makes it worth the price 
This is a great product. I bought it after losing my old computer to intermittent power one more time than I was able to revive the PC. The new APC BE500R Back UPS has work flawlessly since I installed it several weeks ago, and has already intervened for 3 power losses and 19 instances of noisy power. The APC control panel says I have 45 minutes of Estimated Battery Time with my Compaq Presario and 19" flat panel monitor. I think I will get another BE500R for my television and VCRs... 
I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge. It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life. Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all. Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning. I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time 
First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin 
After losing a computer to a power surge, I purchased the APC BE500R Back-UPS for my new computer. I am runninig a 3.2Ghz Tower PC with a 17" LCD Monitor, I have approx. 15 minutes of Battery Runtime on my system, the software that is very easy to install manage, saves any open programs that I am running safely shuts down my computer when the battery gets to within 5 minutes of running out of power if I am away from it. Money Well Spent! You don't need to spend a fortune on Larger units unless you want a longer runtime on Battery 
Fantastic, take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality 
I have been using 3 - 128mb, 1 -256mb, and 1 -8mb card with my 2.1 megapixel camera. That got me about 648 photos which has been great for vacations, etc. With the purchase of a new 7 megapixel camera, I found that my photo storage dropped to about 202 photos which was definitely not enough. With the 2gb card, I can take a minimum of 650 photos without changing cards. With my existing cards, that totals at about 850 photos. That number goes up if I use my macro or supermacro settings (they drop the image size to the medium setting). I have had no problems with any of my compact flash cards (all of them being sandisk), all have worked consistently and without issue 
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries. The Sandisk 2GB Compactflash Card Type I, like most 2000MB cards, will store on average 2275 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 1706 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 1024 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 819 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 640 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera. One last thing to consider when buying a 2000MB card. Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 2000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button. I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs 
I have had this CF card for nearly a year (A year ago, it cost nearly $300--boy those CF memory prices have dropped!) and it has worked without incident where I use it for MP3/WMA storage on my iPAQ PDA. It does not appear to cause a significant power drain on my iPAQ battery, so it must be a fairly efficient chip. The write speed of this chip is roughly 40% slower than a Sandisk Ultra II CF, which is preferrable for digital cameras. For reliable storage and backup applications though, this 2GB CF is now an excellent value 
.............Is not functional................ . If you are reading this then you are Gump-y! And, you and I must be family. First, I love Amazon; they are the consistent type of e-merchant. And that's good! But but but but, why?: would a designated (by me) upper "echelon" merchant like Amazon carry this Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). It simply is not functional information that I stored Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is gone, or not readable. I am surprised that Amazon did not catch-on/up with the problem. The product won't retain any info then I had to store less and less information on the card, so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours. I decided to contact Amazon, they were very shortly, and cordially sent me a replacement Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), with the paperwork for returning the original Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). Then I got something that: A. Did, have the shape of a 2gig Sandisk CF card; B. Did, have the Sandisk label that says Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768)......; C. And did have the original shiny factory Sandisk package. None-being the-less 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed couldn't recognize what is inserted into the CF reader. D. The brand new replacement card I got with the original factory wrapping, that's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers. One may safely assume (pardon the facetiousness), Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), is yet to be recognized. From Amazon, twice in the mail, I got a Sandisk 2 GB compact which flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). Both cards I received had a problem. And therefore, it is safe to assume that Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) production have a major glitch. I mean, the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes. I have to yet see what or for what, other than memory, can I utilize a memory card. I beg your pardon, but in essence I am trying to imply that... The Sandisk products were a joke! :-). Being the consistent e-merchant that Amazon always been, Amazon agreed to return them. This was not a surprise (coming from Amazon). In essence, I strongly urge any person that makes a living, and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to: 1. Not be fooled. If you see Sandisk, run away as fast as possible, 2. You'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so. 3. Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is not compatible with data storage! or even short transfers of data, from a home computer to work. 4. Spend the extra.... on an alternative brand. 5. That's the only way you'll get a CF card that is correctly labeled; and, serve intended functions. 6. I strongly recommend, as well as urge individual who is thinking of getting that "other" brand of 2-giga...... cards to make sure do so:................ 7. Use Amazon only, and don't be fooled by any other e-merchant who's not as high of an echelon as Amazon....... Amazon! 8. Had it not been for Amazon, I would have lost all I paid. :). God bless Amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness, I also pray for Sandisk, so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line. God bless, and keep on shopping. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
The second disc in this package was faulty, which I did not discover until I spent two hours recording a movie. There was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd+r. Not what I expected from Memorex which purports to be the best. I have switched to Maxell 
I have had excellent results transferring my VHS Tapes(movies, etc.)to Memorex DVD+R/RW discs. I have a Philips DVDR985 DVD Recorder/Player and it will only record on DVD+R/RW discs. I have been through several other manufacturers +R/RW discs and none were as reliable as Memorex(and, of course Philips). I ran into a problem recording on the +R disc, however, that was due to a problem with the Recorder. I just bought another 50 DVD+RW Memorex discs(2-25 disc spindles) and when they run out I will still go for Memorex. Chuck A 
Of all the DVD disks I've used this summer, Memorex came second to Sony, but at half the price. I use Memorex now because the quality of the recording is very good and the disks are very reliable 
Nothing special about it, except that it just works in my NEC laptop burner and in my Philips DVD. I am satisfied 
The item does what it should do as advertized. The media code is somewhat few medias use nowadays, and it works fine with all my burners (I used it on Lite-on, TSS, and NEC). No coasters so far (I only burned 5 
Replaced first spindle and still junk. Will always stick with Verbatim from now on 
No problem burning with NEC drive so far. Cannot play-back properly on old DVD players. 
I was deeply disappointed for buying stuff from Memorex. Not a single DVD was usable in the pack. Never gonna buy anything from Memorex! 
I bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site. I was very pleased with the purchase then. I didn't have one problem with the discs. I bought another pack recently and I've been using the pack I just bought. All of the discs are messing up for me. I can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you. I wish I could send these discs back and get a refund. This purchase has scared me away from anything else related to Memorex. I thought Memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers. I guess I was wrong. And apparently you get what you pay for. Don't be fooled by the good price. You'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that wouldn't even be worth using as a frisbee. Find another brand to use and avoid this brand 
I love this. Now my DVD's are in order and they fit perfectly 
I bought one of these a year ago, and have really liked the fact that the spaces will hold up to 5 dvd cases, so I can store sets as well as individual disks. Also, I don't use this as a carrying case, so I have had no problem with anything coming apart. In fact, I like it so well I have just ordered another one 
The product is a good value. It performed well and was fairly easy to use. I only wish it would allow importing play lists from iTunes, all text had to be manually input. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the product 
The main reason I bought this kit was for the label applicator, the software was secondary. Good thing that I didn't care about how good the software would be, because the software for this is, in a word, deplorable. It doesn't have support for ANY other label sheets other than the memorex brand, which leaves you stuck with their labels. Its got some nice features in the software, but their poorly implemented. For instance, it can automatically resize an image to fit a CD/DVD, but if you've rotated it before that, the rotation is lost. It has a lot of minor quirks like that, and they add up to an annoyance to use this. If you get this product, find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator 
I recently purchased this labelmaker system for use on my iMac, and have had no problems at all. I printed out my CD labels on an Epson CX5200. The quality of the printouts isn't as clear as I'd like (most likely due to the quality of the paper), but it's not bad for a home system that cost under $20. It's easy, quick, and has lots of cool graphics 
I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint 
The labels are sticky on one side, and printable on the other, but that's about all this product has going for it. The software is a nightmare. The print previews only vaguely represent the finished product, and the program frequently and randomly alters your image. I wound up using the labels, but creating the documents in MS publisher. what a shame 
They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you 
First of all, despite the claim that it works with MacIntosh, it definately does not. There is a template that you can use in Mac with Word, Claris, and other photoshop software, but there are no instructions as to how. Once you think you have it figured out (on the page) it doesn't print the same as pictured. The technial support people have no idea how to make it work with Mac, and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers. In any case, they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the Word template for MacIntosh. Don't waste your money. (I gave it one star only because no stars is not an option. 
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement. of course you want a hard copy, that is why you bought it. just do it. 
Okay, This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things. If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.) They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!) Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did. If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it 
N.E.W. will waste your time, money, and your every last nerve before repairing your product. Eventually they will, but not without an exhausting, protracted fight 
I am using the CF card in a mictrotek digital recorder. Works just great 
I purchased this flash card to take on vacation so that I would have enough room for all of the pictures I planned to take. I had no problems at all with the card, with the images it produced, or any transfers. I used the card in a Nikon 8800, and now use it as my primary memory. I recommend this card to anyone for its high quality, and low price. It is a good value 
I bought this card from Dell I worried once because some complain it don't work then I learned the card supports FAT32 ONLY, then I did a test on my pda (HP HX2415), format the existing card to FAT32, found the pda supports, and bought I found the card works perfectly with my pdas (HP HX2415 and Dell Axim X50v), no problem so far MUST READ: before buying this 4GB card, you need to do a file system compatibility test you need to save the card's content onto host, then format the card to FAT32 format, then put the card into the device if the device can use the card right away without formatting, you'll be fil 
Beware of KINGSTON rebates! Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible. I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate. I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way. Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date. My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer). The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1 business cards when flattened. No problem. About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer." Well, now WHAT? I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession). I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said. I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase. After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam. They simply wouldn't honor the rebate. And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements. If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair. If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk. For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products. Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices. Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced. I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams 
I previously owned the 1GB Lexar 40X CF card and thought that was the fastest a CF could get. I was completely wrong. This card is one fast sucker, and it can hold an enormous amount of images. In JPEG mode I am able to store over 1000 images. In RAW mode, which I'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card, I am able to hold 444 images all on my 20D!!! If your thinking of buying this card, don't hesitate. It is one awsome piece of equipment, and one heck of an investment!! 
I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate. But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker. I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G. If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod. Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened. So, when was my first clue? Doh 
My review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently. For some months after I first bought the card, it worked great. Now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my Canon Elph, and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card. Judging by what other customers have written, I'm suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between Canon cameras and Viking cards. In any case, I will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a Viking 
I ordered this for my daughter for her digital camera/camcorder and it was a great price for the size of memory card. I have always been very satisfied with purchases from amazon.com A very good online company, with good products and great prices 
I am satisfied with this product. Much better than my 128 card. Lots of pics i use for ebay. Big Time Saver. Excellent. No worries here 
I have always been a fan of Viking chips. The Viking 512 has never disappointed me. 
After serveral months of use, "Card Error" was shown on my Canon Digital Rebel for my 512MB Viking card, which was half full with pictures. Fortunately, I just lost a few of pictures. I tried to format the file; "Card Error" kept occuring on my Rebel. This 512MB Viking card is now used for my data files. Probably, 512MB Viking cards are not designed for high Mega Pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time (i.e. 3 shots/sec.). My Canon A40 has no problems when used with the 512MB Viking card so far. Probably, I am going to buy a 512MB card from Sandisk or Simple Tech 
First time using this brand. No issues at all. Works as expected. Amazon delivery arrives in 3 days for the 3 - 5 days shipment. I am very happy with Amazon's service 
The CF card works fine but it's response is kind of slow compaired to the 32MB CF card came with my Canon Powershot A95. I got this card 3 weeks ago and so far their hasn't been any problems. 
This is an excellent buy and is a quality item. The service was fast and the card works as expected 
I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot. I had such a card for more than a year. In that period, I used it in my camera. It's filled up for several times. Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers. It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera. Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on. I gave the card to other people, so I don't know how it's doing now. After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago. I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet. Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card. One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card. I can not verify though. Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time. ===== One month later ===== I contacted with their customer support. They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card. They sent back a new one in a week. The new one is working fine so far. The exchange was not difficult. They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt. They only verified the serial number. That's good 
I bought this amazing product and now it is easy to have high quality music. Just plug the iPod to your music equipment and you are done. 
I purchased this and am not impressed. Note that "works with all click wheel iPods" isn't true. It does NOT work with photo iPods (at least the 60 GB model). I'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit. I'm ordering a 'photo dock' since I can't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60GB/photo model. If I'd known this, I'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately, since I already have a charger (came with it...). Grr. :- 
I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about when they write that the price is outrageous, but if you are looking for a solution that includes the dock, power brick, and cables than this will save you about $5 - $10. I don't know about the retail price being $99 as listed here, but from what I've been able to find, this is an OK deal for what it includes 
$99.99 list price? Over $70 actual price? You've got to be kidding! I never accuse companies of raping consumers, because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend, but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance. If you want to connect your iPod to your home stereo, get a $7.00 "stereo mini-plug to RCA plug Y-adapter" at Radio Shack. That's all you need. Because you already have a recharger (it came with your iPod), the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your iPod upright. I have this item (it came free with my 40GB iPod) and, although it offers a slight convenience over not having it, the price is a terrible rip-off. 
Just place the iPod Dock in a convenient spot, plug in the iPod Power Adapter and connect it to the dock with the supplied iPod Dock Connector to FireWire Cable. Plug the Monster Cable into the mini-stereo line out connection on the back of the dock and then into any available audio input on a home stereo receiver. Dock your iPod and rock the house! This kit includes everything you need to connect iPod with Click Wheel or iPod mini to a home stereo system. Includes: iPod Dock iPod Power Adapter iPod Dock Connector to FireWire Cable Monster Cable Mini-Stereo to RCA Cable Bring your music library into your living room. This kit includes everything you need to connect your iPod to your home stereo including a Monster Cable audio cable. Supports iPod models with Dock Connector. Does not support iPod shuffle 
This is basically a 1/8" male to RCA cable for $73; you could get the same exact cable for $5.99 at Radio Shack. Yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out; not worth it. Buy the cable at RS; it'll work EXACTLY the same.. don't be fooled. If you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately; you'll save major $$$.. 
This stereo connector is fabulous. I already had a very good Kenwood stereo system with great speakers. Now I can play any of the 10,000 songs from my IPOD through my stereo. The wires from this kit just plug into the back of the receiver in an open slot, I use the "Video 2" slot on my receiver. The connecting wire goes into the IPOD cradle. Then simply put the IPOD in the cradle, select Video 2 on the receiver and ta-da all of my music at my fingertips without getting out hundreds of CDs. Also, because the IPOD will shuffle, now my stereo shuffles too, either through all of my music or through any genre. Finally not only does it play the songs but it also charges the IPOD as well. This is absolutely the best accessory I've purchased for my IPOD. It's well worth the investment 
OK - here's what you get: 1 power supply brick 1 iPod dock 1 3-foot cable to connect power supply brick and dock 1 3-foot cable to connect dock and stereo This version of the kit is compatible with 3rd and 4th generation iPods (those with a dock connector on the bottom) and with the iPod mini. Although the dock connector is electronically the same for all these iPods, the dimensions of the iPod itself differ by model. Thus, the dock comes with different plastic tops for the different sizes of iPods and you snap on the right-sized top for your iPod (check the size carefully before snapping on the cover - it goes on easily, but it doesn't come off easily). The cable that connects the power supply brick and the dock is a special Apple firewire-to-iPod-dock cable, but the cable that connects the iPod and the stereo system is nothing special, just a standard stereo minijack plug on one end and two rca phono plugs on the other. You can get a compatible cable from many different vendors and in many different lengths; which in my case was a good thing because the 3-foot length in the kit was too short. Is the kit a good buy? Well, it depends. If you price all of the components in the kit separately, you will find that the kit is cheaper than the individual parts, even if you have to replace the stereo cable as I did. But, the question is, do you need to buy all the parts. Let's assume for the moment that you do in fact want to attach your iPod to your stereo and consider what you might be able to do without: (1) Power supply brick. Your iPod and dock will in fact work fine without being plugged into the power supply. The trade-off is that without it you will drain the battery of the iPod while it is plugged into your stereo. You can get a dock and a stereo cable for substantially less than this kit, so if you're OK with the battery issue, you can save money by not getting the kit. (2) iPod dock. You can plug the iPod into the stereo without the dock. The same stereo cable that connects the dock to the stero will also connect the iPod to the stereo. There are two disadvantages to this: first, the dock gives a true line-out, meaning that the volume control on the iPod doesn't affect the volume coming out of the dock, so you just use the stereo's volume control to control the playback volume. The audio-out jack on the iPod, however, is affected by the iPod's volume control, so if you connect it to the stereo, you have to be careful about the fact that there are two volume controls in the system, which is annoying at best, and there might be some risk to your stereo if the iPod's volume is too high. It is also worth noting if you have a power supply brick, you do not need the dock to recharge your iPod - the brick can plug into the iPod directly. If you are OK with the audio-out thing (and whether and how to keep your iPod upright without it) you can save money by not getting the kit and doing without the dock. (3) Power-supply brick to dock cable. If you don't have the brick, you don't need the cable; if you do have the brick, you need the cable or the brick isn't going to do you any good. If you have decided you can do without recharging the iPod while it is connected to your stereo, you can skip the brick and this cable both. (4) Dock-to-Stereo cable. This is the thing you can't do without if you want to connect your iPod and your stereo, but you have a lot of choices on vendors if this is all you're getting. Even if you aren't getting a dock, the cable that would connect the dock to the stereo is the same one that would connect the iPod to the stereo directly. One more thing to consider is that your iPod might have already come with one or more of these pieces, and if you aren't using them elsewhere, you could use them as part of your stereo set-up and just buy any other pieces you need and not get the whole kit. For me, I didn't have any extra pieces and I wanted the works - to recharge the iPod and not have to worry about a double volume control, so I got the kit. I also got the NaviPod IR Remote (which you can get right here at Amazon) so that I could control it remotely like the rest of my stereo gear. To make your decision, just figure out what you want to have, what pieces you have already, and what you might be willing to live without and then make your decision. Hope this was helpful 
A lot of space -- My computer is over 5yrs old so I use these CD's as a great back up for storing all my old documents, my ebooks, and my pics. 
100 cds is a lot of cds (though you'd be surprised how many it takes to back up a PC. Uh, when DID you last back up YOUR data?) You can put pictures, files, music on these cds. We use them just for data backup, and use Fellowes software and labels to make custom labels with contents. These are filed in an album and it's easy to reload or retrieve data in this manner. We have not had any problem writing or reading these cds 
I do all my burning on a standard Windows Media player, and it's almost entirely data and music, no video. For my purposes, these CD's sound great. In some cases, it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat. That may be a trick my ears are playing on me but, nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the Memorex. And they're a steal if you catch the sale price. Recommended 
This product has not had any flaws from day 1! Quality is great 
These CDs are always a great price and a good buy, no complaints 
As a person who has used lots of writable CD and DVD products I would highly recommend this product. I have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product. If your storage needs are under 650 + megabytes I would buy this product. Note : This product needs several Megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 Merabytes of your data. For the price listed this ad it is a great deal as well.. 
These and Fuji are the best CDRs on the market. Very few bad disks in the batch. The price seals the deal! 
At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place. A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself. Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the "Verify Written Data" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software. I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog. PS. I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse 
Very good item for the amount of money it cost. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a decent amount of space 
The best value in memory stick is SanDisk. Quality and very good price. I will buy again SanDisk products. 
First time to get into the "digital age". When investigating about what to purchase I was advised to be sure to memory stick that was "fast". This is blazing! Burst shots, movies, etc 
This product has worked very well in my Sony 8.1MP Digital camera. Nothing has gone wrong after having it used for 3 months now. Good alternate to Sony's ProDuo memory stick which works with the PSP as well 
When I buy flash memory, I consider price, speed, manufacturer and vendor. I got this particular memory stick for a SonyEricsson w810i phone. I paid extra to get it from Amazon (no they don't always have the best price). This way I am confident that I can return it if I got the wrong one or have a problem with it. The card works fine in my phone, and since I have a USB cable that hooks up to the phone, I don't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader. I have not yet experienced any problems with Sandisk memory products. I am told that the Sandisk sticks are faster than Sony's, but I have no way to confirm this, nor do I know if my phone (mp3 player, camera) is able to take advantage of faster speeds. The longest process is transferring music to the phone, and I wasn't in a hurry anyway. This stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format, so I can use the 128mb stick that I replaced in my Sony Camcorder (which had a 4mb stick in it. No, it's not a typo. It's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick) 
I recommend this item to all them who intend to buy 1 gb memory stick for their cameras and cells. 
I have a Sony Cybershot DSCP-100, I love the camera and use it for taking SCUBA Diving pictures. I bought this memorystick duo to use for that purpose, I can take up to 45 minutes of video or close to 400 pictures on highest quality setting. The memorystick comes with an adapter so you can use it in full size memory stick applications as I do in the camera, or you can use this without the adapter for PSP, and PDA or cell phones! The price couldn't be beat anywhere else and I received the shipment within a week at my FPO mailbox on base here in Japan. If you want a great deal pick one up, I may even buy one more for when I travel so I don't have to take my laptop with me to download and reformat the card, at this price I can afford it 
I could easily found Amazon is the cheap seller of this product. Others will the same item for less online but they charge big amount of shipping and tax. The product is real good and working nice with my new Sony camcorder 
Earbuds are of good qualityWinding case is of no use . I took it as a replacement for Ipod earbuds. The quality is much better than the one suppplied by Apple along with ipod. 
I purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight. My husband and I both used them, and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes. They were great at first, but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears. The inside of my ears were so sore I couldn't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out, that's how bad my ears hurt. I had the foam pad over them too, and it made no difference. I would not recommend these 
These earphones are the best I ever had. I never had to try other pairs of earphone because I absolutely loved these that I keep buying it! After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen. 
This item is the greatest, Bass is excellent, suround,... i never got like this purity of sound from other headsets or earphones, although i have another sony headset (sports headset) its good but its nothing like this, and this one is only for 10$ or less!!! 
I bought these to use with my Samsung Z5 mp3 player. While the packaged earbuds were good, the sound was just drowning in bass. I like good bass, but not when it completely overpowers everything else. I had given the Sony 51's a try and promptly returned them; they sounded ok, but kind of made my ears hurt, and for $40, they weren't worth it. I had read some reviews on these 828's, so I decided to go with these. The sound is incredible. The bass is well defined, but is balanced nicely with the midrange and treble. I was literally hearing nuances in the music that I didn't with other buds. They fit very well (though any earbuds will start to feel uncomfortable after a period of extended use, which is discouraged anyway). A set of black foam earbud pads is included. I always prefer to use the pads, but it is of course your own call whether or not you use them. The pads will wear out, but you can buy exact replacements at Radio Shack (pack of 4 for $4) that fit perfectly. Personally, I usually end up replacing the pads every few months or so. My only gripe about the 828's (and the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the cord is too short for my taste. About another foot or so would be nice. Otherwise, this is a great product and at around $10 is a STEAL 
These earphones are incredible! They are comprised of excellent bass and treble. You experience everything much nicely. These earphones compared to the iPod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things. I bought these from ebay for $8 and for that amount of price, you can't regret buying these sensational earphones 
I've been on the lookout for replacement earbuds for my nano and finally found these. I think they are just awesome and believe Apple should bundle these with their nano. For the price this is a steal. With the right EQ setting on the nano, I just love these buds. Excellent Bass and with the 'Treble Booster' EQ setting in the iPod ON, these buds become perfect nearly. Before getting these buds I bought Senn HD-202, Grado SR-60 and Koss KSC-75 and though all of these are really good for different kinds of music that I listen, none of them compliment my iPod Nano the way these buds too. With the Winding case, their style, their sound quality and an unbelivable price I think they are just the perfect buds for the nano. As for their comfort, I think they are well suited for people on the move and are as comfortable as the original apple buds. Go get these and soon you'll be getting another pair 
I had a pair of earbuds that came with my Creative mp3 player last September that I really liked, but for whatever reason the cord length was different between the left and right earbud. Either way, I tore them up on accident and decided to go with these Sonys. The bass isn't quite as strong as it was in the Creative ones, but these are solid earbuds and worth the price. The cord length is the same for both earbuds on this model and the nice little plastic winding case is handy. For the price, these are definitely worthy of a purchase 
Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones. I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones. However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped. Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable. Pros: lightweight, budget-oriented, comfortable fit for my ears Cons: eventually broke, cheap earphone covers will get lost easil 
I have had an iPod mini for over a year now and everyone knows iPods come with the classic white Apple earbuds. Well, one day, I missplaced my Apple earbuds and borrowed my dad's earbuds (the Sony ones on this page). I needed to borrow them 'cause I was getting dragged to my little sister's softball tournament which was pretty far away. The catch here? My dad drives a huge diesel truck. The NOISY ones. So we all got into the truck and I tried out the headphones and I was just blown away. I could actually HEAR my music. Unlike the Apple ones, these were quiet and comfortable, actually shaped like an ear. They even come with a cool case and little plushy things. The only bad thing about the little black plush things is they slip off the earbuds very easily and will eventually disspear. It's a pity too, they were very comfy. But even without the plushies, the earbuds were still comfy. Basically, I highly recommend these lovely, lovely little earbuds 
I bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my MacBook Pro. I loved it, until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working. It's not connecting to the USB adapter any more. I changed the battery and tried the Connect button, and nothing. Sad, isn't it 
I received a previous version of this mouse as a promotional gift from Microsoft, and since have not been able to separate myself from it whenever I travel. It is the most "plug and play" piece of hardware I have ever purchased for a pc (noteboook or otherwise) -- no software installation or complicated setup necessary. It of course does not have the bells and whistles that the Logitech Revolution series mice have (ie. tilt wheel/side to side scrolling, customizable buttons, and easily-accessible forward/back buttons for fast and efficient web browsing), but for basic functionality, this mouse simply cannot be beaten. As a travel companion, it is extraordinarily lightweight and low maintenance -- with its snap-in receiver, there are no worries of ever leaving for a business trip with unnecessary weight or having to account for multiple devices/attachments just to make offsite work more tolerable (ie. why bring a mouse when just using the laptop's touchpad was a better option than having to worry about one more thing to keep track of?). This mouse, however, has me spoiled -- I even use it while working on my laptop at home, sitting on my couch (the optical laser even works quite well on the surface of a leather couch!). The soft-touch buttons and scroll wheel are also amazingly easy on the hand when doing a ton of repetitive movements. One thing of importance to note, however, is that the version I got from Amazon does *not* have the same adjustable receiver that my promotional version has. While the receiver still easily and conveniently snaps into the bottom of the mouse, it sticks out quite a bit more than the adjustable version does, and resultingly would also not work as well with notebooks that have a vertical (as opposed to horizontal) USB port. Nevertheless, this is such a great mouse I felt compelled to have more than just one 
I bought this mouse about 14 months back!!! And it's been working great! Pros: =========== 1. Nice design 2. good looks 3. ergonomic 4. I use it almost 14 hours a day, and need to charge/replace the battery like once in a month 5. good range: i did not need to buy a RC because of this. 6. light weight/small 7. Can rotate the USB transmitter by 90 deg, hence will work even if you have vertical USB slots on your laptop. Cons: ========== 1. would have liked it more if it had an internal battery and some way of charging it through the USB connection. I use a rechargeable battery, and need to charge it monthly. 
I bought 2 of this and its works very well in my home and in my office 
Muy pero muy bueno, es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira 
This is a great mouse. The size is perfect because it isn't too big or too small. Also, the battery lasts forever. I've had the mouse for over a year, I use it every day and I still haven't replaced the battery. I liked it so much that I got one for my Mom when she got a laptop. She's a flight attendant so she travels all the time and she really likes the mouse too. Good portability and functionability 
Product works great, fits nicely in my hand, but I do have small hands. Battery life not that long though. Otherwise worth the money 
Have not had to use it yet so I don't know. Did I really need it I don't know but I bought it 
After having two SanDisk card readers, and one LaCie card reader die on me, I invested in this Lexar card reader. For the money, it has worked flawlessy with Pro compact flash cards up to 4GB in size. I am very impressed with the transfer speeds, and the unit is not too big for traveling. The door that covers the slot, however, is very flimsy and easily deattaches (but fortunately easily reattaches too?) I use Mac OS X 10.4.8 and it works just fine. I also used it with Windows XP without any installation or transfer issues 
I'm a Mac user (OS 10.4) so I particularly like that this reader doesn't require a separate driver. Cards mount on my desktop as any drive would, and the software that came with my Canon Powershot G6 senses the card automatically. I have had no trouble with the cover hinge as another reviewer mentioned. I love the fact that it's small and lightweight and fits into a tiny pocket on my camera case so I never lose track of it. The LED lets you know when files are being transferred and when it's safe to disconnect the device. Overall, it's inexpensive, fast and easy-to-use ~ a great value 
Outstanding little product. Good human interface. Able to use it immediately and much faster than cameral software 
This little reader is fast and as easy to use as a USB flash drive. Pop in your card, plug it in, and wahlah, all your files are shown. Transfers are very fast and easy. It uses a standard USB cable, so it's likely you could use the same cable for a variety of devices (MP3 player, camera, cell phone) The device is somewhat flimsy, however and the front always snaps off when you try to open the unit rather than working like a hinge, as it should. This is somewhat annoying to have to reattach the hinge everytime, so it gets 4 stars. Still a very good buy, especially for the price 
A simple, cheap investment. This CF reader actually does what it should, i.e. transfer info from compact flash to the computer. Previous Kodak 1.0 multi-card reader had issues after a few weeks, and stopped working after 2 months. This one is much faster and is still working. Ahhhhh 
This reader is very fast - compared to my usb1 and non-cardbus pcmcia compact flash readers this one is about 4x (or more) as fast. It is small and compact, the only thing I don't like is the required USB cable (though it is included) instead of a built in USB plug - just one more thing to bring with my laptop 
Just some specs missing from amazon's description: USB 2.0 CompactFlash Reader Small and travels with ease LED status indicator indicates when files are being transferred Data transfer speeds up to 480Mb/s Backward compatible with USB 1.1 Ships with removable USB 2.0 cable Features Designed for large data transfers, like images, music and video Data transfer 5 to 6 times faster than using USB 1.1 Portable - weighs only 1.5 ounces Protective cover case keeps reader pins away from external hazards Compatible with Windows 2000/ME/XP and Mac OS X and 9.1 No drivers required with most current operating systems 2-year Limited Warranty 
I was so impressed with the amount of memory on this media card. I wondered if I could take a movie of my son's 3 minute song at his school band concert. I probably had at least a dozen or more pictures at the highest quality on the card already so was so surprised that I had 23 minutes of movie memory available! What a price to pay for peace of mind 
I have had this memory card for a little less than two months and I have had no problems using it with my Fugi camera. I would recommend this card to a friend 
The 1gb holds soooo many pictures and videos! This is so compact and my pictures are downloaded, quickly! Buy it, you'll love it 
This was the least expensive 1 GB memory card I have ever seen and it works as well as it should 
Product was just what I was looking for and at the right price. Could not have been happier with my purchase. I will look for this vendor again in the future 
This card seems to give the same excellent photos as my other Fuji cards. Love the huge number of photos I can take. Very handy when traveling outside the US with no access to back up 
I found the service fast and the product great. It was a very good price. Thanks, I will use your service again 
This card is the largest size that will allow clean video with FinePix cameras from 2004 or earlier. The picture-to-picture lag time is minimal with this card and video is excellent. From Fuji Website - "NOTE: for owners of FinePix cameras made before 2004, check notice below for the operating compatibility of older FinePix cameras with Type M and H. 
Great card, crisp clear shots. Fuji continues to provide the best in pic. cards. 
I love this printer. Simple to use and great for the price. Cartridge doesn't last more than 2 months if you do a lot of printing, but inexpensive to replace and easy to find. 
I've had this printer for about 3 months. I do a good amount of printing and still have nearly half the catridges left (I've only printed papers and images that came out great.. never tried photos yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if they come out decent)! Not to mention there are only 2 catridges (compared to 4 on my old epson!), that are a decent price compared to other brands. It rarely jams, but you should keep an eye on it.. nothing too extreme. It's small, lightweight and prints from the last page to the first so it's all in order once it's finished printing. I bought this new on amazon for around 30 dollars and would say it was the best purchase I could have made... (better than my old epson i spent 200 on that guzzled ink after two photos and died after a year! 
Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments. It prints off things quite well and it is fast. It does not, however, print 500 pages per month. 50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them. The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition. 
This is a very nice printer, especially for the price. Quick printing, good quality 
Printer exactly as advertised. Small and easy to use. Was delivered quickly along with the black ink cartridge. It is perfect for my use 
I detest this printer. I've bought quite a few printers in my day: Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits. The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on. It just died on me. I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again. This time for good. I returned it, got another one...same problem. Except this time it keeps going. All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on. Nice, huh? Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure. No more el cheapo models. I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
I only paid $30 including shipping and taxes. The ink cartridges alone are worth that. Printer works great. Set up easy BUT DO NOT USE THE CD PROVIDED, It loads and incredible amount B/S that you do not need-some of which is impossible to get off your computer once loaded. Instead google a driver off the internet and download it 
There are so many times we often see the musts of having a quality printer for all occasions. Although it isn't actually a bad thing, it does become a important tool for our everyday computer use. That has been the case whether you need to fax a freshly printed version of a resume, or show a graphic chart of sales for your company. Well, the folks at Hewlett-Packard know exactly what they're talking about. They've been making quality printers for all walks of life. But, with the hassle of finding a inexpensive printer for those on a strict budget, than this is your key to a quality printer at a inexpensive cost. The Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 3930 Color Inkjet Printer is arguably, the most convient, and easy to setup printer right now on the market. It just simply hooks through your USB port, either 1.1. or 2.0, and it will print anything you need to save on paper. It is easy to operate, and runs smoothly without any messy problems. The copies it prints up are neat and near flawless on a color or a black inkjet cartridge #21 and #22. Still, there are a few disadvantages though with the printer. One of them is that it doesn't come with a standard USB cable, you'd have to buy that on your own, and the same goes with the black inkjet cartridge. Although that is a must, you can still print black and white copies for your convience with the colored inkjet cartridge #22 by itself. Despite a couple of add-ons you'd need to buy, The HP Deskjet 3930 is a well-certified printer for anyone who needs a good printer, without a inexpensive price. I needed this to replace a problem I had with my previous printer, and it works like a charm. I definitely recommend this printer a whole lot. Price: A- Convience: B+ Easy To Operate: B Instructions: B Overall: B 1/2 
I was looking for a cheap, dependable printer and found exactly what I needed just to print out invoices. That's all we do with the printer. Can't beat this printer for the price and quality of print. We also received it when in a timely manner in good condition. I love ordering on Amazon!! 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
The advancements in technology never cease to amaze me. They continue to get smaller and smaller even when you didn't think it was possible. Such is the case for the Panasonic SD Memory card as well. Not only is it small, but it has a large capacity for adapting to a variety of digital content types. This SD Memory Card can write data at a rate of 10 MB per second! I mainly use my SD Memory card to save music from my MP3 player. I normally get about 5 1/2 hours out of the card. I highly recommend this to anyone who uses audio, video, communications and information devices and appliances. It is the wave of the future 
When I bought my 3G 20GB iPod, this part was included. Fortunately when I sold the iPod, I forgot to include it, because we are getting a Video today, and now I learn this item is not included. Way to go Apple...I believe it is called fleecing your customers. At least there is an alternative way to charge these... Very useful item, I agree, as much as I hate paying more, I also hate burning out a high dollar piece of electronics (iPod/Cell Phone/PDA/Laptop) because some company had monkeys putting them together in a remote jungle in Indonesia or something. I have had too many friends lose cells in particular because of the $5 charger they found online or at the flea market 
Functionally, this works fine. Compact design, AC plug folds in for a smooth case, easy to pack, hard to damage, and since there is no cord associated with the input to the AC outlet, there is one less thing to lose or damage. There is a USB cord from the unit to the IPOD, but that is it. A little more expensive, since it has an Apple logo associated with it, but it works 
Yes, Apple should include this thing -- with the higher end iPods, at least. But they don't. The point of this post is to remind prospective USB-Power-Adapter buyers this: with electronics, you tend to get what you pay for. So, you're tempted by those three-dollar, off-brand USB adapters? Stay away from them. You have, probably, a couple hundred bucks tied up in your iPod(s); it doesn't make sense to cheap-out now and take a risk with shoddy, fly-by-night electronics for your iPod....the same iPod that you scrupulously protect from scratches and such. Apple designed their USB Power Adapter to work with their iPods. And they do work. Very well. Shame on Apple for fleecing us, though. But, shame on you if you damage the electronics of your iPod by using some third-rate, flea market power adapter. Just buy Apple's 
I don't understand why people spend money on this charger, when you can pay half as much for the same thing. I bought an iPod charger for my 5G iPod video from Sonnet Technologies and I am very satisfied. It is small and the connectors retract for easy carrying around. Search Amazon for "Sonnet USB Wall Charger for Ipod with USB-to-Dock Cable" at about HALF the price. It comes in black or white to go with the color of your iPo 
...this should be included in the box when you buy the iPod. Shame on you, Apple 
I have a USB AC charger and car charger that came with my Palm PDA, and they work just fine with my Nano. Don't waste your money supporting Apple when it charges $30 for basically a piece of plastic 
When you use the video function on your iPod it depletes the battery pretty quick. I can keep this nifty little gadget with me and juice up my iPod anytime I want. Great product, I highly recommend it 
Not much to say about the item other than it works as expected without any issues whatsoever 
Not a coaster in the bunch. I started using these a year back and have stuck with a winner. I won't buy anything else. And a bargain at that too 
I have had no problem using these disks. I have bought several packs and all disks seem to work and have been great in transferring home movies, doing computer backups, etc 
I have used over 100 of the dics to burn movies and otehr files and have never had a problem with the quiait. they work great 
I've burned about 200 memorex 4.7gb DVDs and havent had a single coaster.. works for me 
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done. Were it a compatibility issue I could understand, but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media. I'm going back to using my cheap disks! The lesson here is: " If it works, dont fix it! 
The Memorex DVD+R 16x discs are great. I have a LaCie external 16x burner that I use with my mac and I have not yet burned a bad disc. I would reccommend this product to anyone looking for lots of media for a good price 
In each pack there have been several dvd's that aren't any good. Too many bad discs in my opinio 
Manufactured of a soft gray felt like material, a tough leather bottom, and draw string closure at the top, this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements. I store my lenses in a camera bag, and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space. This case is meant for use with the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L USM, 17-40mm f/4L USM, 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 EF/EFS lenses. These L lenses normally come with the case when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. However if your case is worn, replacing it to protect your lens is recommended. PROS: Protects your glass investment CONS: I cannot think of an 
It would not download; it just stopped about 1/4 the way through. I will have to send it back 
I bought this flash drive about 4 months ago, and it's worked perfectly, I use it everyday, it has a great feature for hidding important information, a password restricted area on the flash drive, it's perfect because you don't have to worry anymore when lending your flash drive about compromising your info..... 
It worked file with Win 2k, but as soon as I switched to Windows Xp, this device was rendered utterly useless to me - it won't shut down or eject, and windows explorer won't see it. Grrrrrrrr ..... 
This flashdrive does its job well under normal circumstances. It works fine for transfering data between computers running Windows when network is not avail, or when large filesize is involved. Its impressively quick at uploading big files. And best of all you can take it right out of the package and use it. No fuss or setup time involved. Windows XP recognizes it in seconds. 
I'm a school teacher and use the cruzer to store all of my lesson plans and school related documents. The 2.0 GB replaced my 1.0 GB that went through the wash twice, and still worked, but was starting to come apart, they take abuse and keep going. The amount of memory is great. Its very simple to use, all you need to do is plug it into the USB port and its ready to use just like an old floppy disk. I have 3 years worth of documents on it and I haven't even made a dent in the amount of memory. I would highly recommend this product. Its a great buy for the price 
I have had 2 different brands of flash drives. One was a lexar that i went through 2 in about a 4 month span. I have 2 of the SanDisk Cruzer Mini 2GB drives and I had NO problems what so ever with speed and durablity. In fact, both of the drives accidently went through the laundry. And they both still work. Greatest drive I EVER got. Highly recommended! 
I've had this drive over a year and have used it continuously to store notes and documents both at school and at work. This device is slender enough to fit in a laptop USB slot and allow the slot beneath it to be available for another device (Mouse, Thumb drive, etc). Also, I've accidentally sent this baby through the washer a couple of times. I don't think it's been in the dryer (yet), but the fact that it's been in water twice and still works makes me glad that I purchased the device I did. By the way, I use my drive to transfer files from every computer I work on, which includes my Mac Mini, my Dell at work, my Macbook Pro at school, and my Linux box serving my web site. No drivers were needed for OSX, XP, or Suse Linux. One last positive statement... The lanyard that comes with the drive works great... It's soft and has a great little clip that has worked hundreds of times for me. This is a very appropriate drive to wear as a necklace if you need to move a lot of geek tools or data around daily. One negative for thumb drives in general - they stick out of your laptop, and if you tilt your laptop towards them they may bend or crack... External devices should have built-in joints to mitigate this problem 
When I was shopping for a flash drive, I saw that someone complained about the slow speed of this drive. It almost scared me away from buying it, but now I'm glad I don't believe everything I hear. This is the fastest media I've ever used, and if someone has one that doesn't run fast, the problem is with their own system or files. A hundred megs in the blink of an eye is plenty fast enough for me. I'm a hands down believer in the SanDisk Cruzer Mini 2GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive. Stop looking, cause you just found the best buy 
I use my Cruzer Mini constantly at work. It's great for quick data transfers, small utilities, drivers or patching systems that are off the network. It's slim and lightweight enough that I tend to drop it in my shirt pocket and forget about it. You probably see where this is going...but yes, it's been run through the washing machine at least four times. What may be even more impressive is that it's been run through the dryer three times (once I did catch it after being washed and saved it from the dryer, allowing it to air dry instead). It still works as well as the day I took it out of the package, never missing a beat 
Like any good piece of technology, this card stays out of the way, operating fast (I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT), trouble-free (so far), and behind the scenes. I bought this model because it was the best price per storage space solution for the format at the time. I'm sure that very soon, that magical price point will shift to 4 GB or higher 
Bought this CF card for my new Olympus E500 back in May. So far this card is great. Really fast transfer rate from the card to the computer. About a month ago, 3 of the photos I took corrupted, I just reformated the card with the camera, so far so good 
I use this with my Canon Rebel XT, and it works fantastic. With 8+ MP camera, you need to have fast media or you might miss a moment. I have had many SanDisk cards, and they have all worked flawlessly. This one stays in my camera all the time, and I am hard-pressed to fill it up on a single shoot. This is the equivalent of dozens of rolls of film... (I dont shoot in RAW, but even if I did, it would be fine) 
With the large file size of pro DSLR's shot in RAW, every little bit of speed counts, whether at capture or download. There are faster Compact Flash cards out there, and there are definately slower ones, but for the price, this is a great card 
I use this card with my Nikon D200. The card writes data incredibly quickly, saving my raw 10.2 MP images with no problem. I've used this card in all sorts of conditions, from below freezing to well over 100 degrees with no problems. The data recovery software included is equally amazing. I was able to salvage pictures on my card I accidentally erased quite long ago with no loss. This comes with a warning--pictures you "deleted" remain on the camera, so it needs to be wiped securely before exchanging hands. Finally, this card while fast, is only as fast as the camera. If you don't need this speed, there are slower, cheaper ones available 
I purchased several of these cards .... they work great and as advertised. The D200 has a memory buffer ... but these are still FAST cards! I have used them in the D70 as well. 
I usually purchase Lexar cards for my 20D. The sandisk was a better price so I decided to try it. It is fast with its write speed. I can pop off a number of images without having to wait for it to write to the card. The image quality is excellent...I think that the colors may be a little more vibrant than the ones I have on the Lexar cards. I think that I am going to switch to Sandisk 
I purchased this card to go with my Canon DSLR. Initially was worried about the speed of transfer from camera to this card then from card to desktop. My concerns were unfounded 
After having great experience with the 1GB extreme III card, I ordered the 2GB just before I went on a short vacation. I love the speed of the extreme III cards - writing to the card I can actually exceed the camera's stated continuous frame (manual says about 9, but I've gotten over 20 in a row with before a delay) and reading the large amount of data off the card is similarly speedy when using a good usb 2.0 card reader. Sandisk just released the extreme IV cards, but for the price difference I think this card is a better deal 
I am hard on cards and these take it well - they keep up with my d2x and have the space promised. I like the soft keychain protector case they come i 
Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly. 
It comes in the retail packaging and a little clear plastic case which holds both the card and the regular SD adapter. I got it for my LG CU500 phone and so far no problems at all 
It does what its supposed to do, but its kind of slow. I bought it for my LG Fusion phone. I am not sure if it is the phone or the card, but when it is pulling images from the card it is extremely slow. Have no problem playing MP3s through 
Didn't realize exactly how small this chip would be. Has worked well with no problems so far. Have had it about 2 months. Would recommend to others 
It seems that the micro age really is here. These MicroSD chips are big on storage. I bought this chip for my LG Chocolate phone of all things. Its a cheap way to store pictures, notes, music(MP3's) etc. Great price. 
The transaction was easy and the response was immediate. I received the product well within the time it was expected and I have been happy with the memory card since I received it. 
Bought the card from Emartbuy since they were the cheapest, I got the card after like 4 days later, their great. Yea the card seems to be good, sandisk doesn't make garbage, unlike other brands. Good card, get i 
I bought this card to replace the 128MB card that came with my Garmin i3 GPS. Works great! I was able to use the included SD adapter for my 128MB card 
I use the memory card in my Samsung d807 phone. Works perfecty 
Start off with the bad news. I have a Motorola DVR / Converter box with my Comcast cable service, and the Comcast remote sends the ADS box into gonzo fits. Attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ADS box to switch inputs. Using the cable DVR fast-forward button cycles the ADS through screen formats with each button push, etc. I contacted ADS tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time. Obviously, this is not acceptable. Too bad because this box does a much better job than my Philips Cineos at upscaling. Tivo, analog cable, DVD, Laserdisc all look better. The improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle, but definitely not worth it if you have a Motorola cable box that will conflict. 5 stars for video quality, 3 stars for user interface (which is not so great), subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict. 
For the Price, I doubt you could do better. True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments. This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price. One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range 
This is about the least expensive Scaler you will find, Period. I have a Home Theater system which includes a Front projection system with a D-Theater 40000u JVC VCR and a high end DVD Player. The Projectors native resolution is 1024x768. I set the HD VCR for 1080i and use the HDUP1500 HDTV to downconvert the D-theater to my projectors maximum resolution. The Picture looks great. I also use the Scaler to upscale DVD and it does a good job. When you enlarge a dvd Image without the use of the upconverter on a 100" screen it doesnt stand up too well and Normal Televison fairs even worse. This scaler upconverts both and I cant begin to tell what an improvement this scaler makes on quality. One improvement they should make is to include an rgb connection. My projector does not have a component connection so I use a KDS Transcoder. While there are scalers that do a better job they dont come close to the bang for buck you get out of this unit 
I still have to review some of the finer functions of the unit, but overall, it does its job. One major bonus that most overlook, it eliminates a ton of wires going to the monitor/tv. That is a huge saving right offthe bat. The native pass-through of 1080i looks good. A 408i Directv/Tivo looks great upconverted too. I found the remote to be a bit clunky when changing inputs and using PIP. It might be just a case of getting used to it. I am looking for a way of hiding select inputs. Overall this product simplifies installation of multiple devices and looks good too 
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house). I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable. When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought. She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on. I said "it IS ON!!" This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it. The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different. It was NOT noticably better. In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse. I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for). So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter. It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture. Save your money. If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing 
This charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully. I thought that my rechargable batteries were "out of life", but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully. My Daughter brought home a cheap Sakar overnight charger when visiting. I popped in a set of batteries I thought were done for, and found them to be just fine using her Sakar charger. What happens on my charger is that the lights (indicating that the batteries have been fully charged) all go off, and the batteries are "cool to the touch" (indicating that they have been fully recharged). Nope! Only about half way recharged 
I was impressed with the charger for about 1 month---than it stopped charging the NiMh batteries it came with. I took it back to Best Buy only to find that ALL of the Rapid Chargers on thier shelf did not work either. A sales person and I tested them all, hoping I would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked. It was more disappointing after calling Kodak ---they were unable to replace it or get my money back. I thought purchasing a Kodak was a smart decision, however, they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing. 
While traveling in China I hooked up this charger to a Sharper Image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking. A much better buy would be the Sony charger with worldwide voltage and for 5 dollars less 
I have two of these chargers that I bought directly from Kodak for about $10 each. Each of them came with 4 AAA batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package. One of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use. Battery charger technology is not all that complicated but Kodak doesn't seem to have mastered it yet. No wonder they were practically giving these away. I'd avoid purchasing these now at any price 
I have had this Kodak Charger for almost 2 years now. I liked it so well I went back and order another one for my daughter. I use mine to charge AA batteries for my Olympus and S series Canon digital cameras. My daughter recharges her C-Series Olympus camera and for re-charging battery operated toys for her twins. Between the two of us, we have 3 years experience using this model charger. We like it because it is so portable. Just fold in the AC prongs and toss it in your bag, purse, or coat pocket. No need to carry the charger, plus an AC adapter and cord with you. This charger easily fits in our camera bags. I have used the Kodak Rapid Charger to charge various batteries rated in power from 1600 to 2200 milliamps (mA) with no problem. It usually takes about 3 hours. What sold me was the portability and the trickle charge. With some battery chargers, you have to be sure to unplug it after so many hours before it overheats and becomes a fire hazard. The Kodak Rapid Charger can be plugged in and it will not overheat or overcharge the batteries. So, if I forget the batteries are charging it is no problem. I can unplug this charger "whenever". I especially appreciate that when I travel and can recharge the batteries in an afternoon or overnight in my hotel room. When I travel is when I am most distracted and not following my normal routine, so that is when I am most apt to forget that I have batteries charging. Not a problem with this charger. You can leave the charger plugged in indefinitely. This charger lights up with green lights when it is charging. When the batteries are charged, the lights go out, so it is easy to see when the batteries are fully charged. Even from across the room. Some folks have mentioned that the batteries fall out. I believe that is because when you plug this charger into a wall outlet, the batteries are in a vertical position in the charger. Gravity will tend to pull them out of the charger if the batteries are not firmly seated in the charger, or you slap the charger against the wall so hard, the batteries will bounce out of the charger. I have had this happen too. However, all I had to do is put the batteries the charger and gently insert the charger into the wall outlet. When I am in a hurry is when I have had the batteries fall out. Besides, I figured if I cannot gently insert this charger in the wall, I can always use a short extension cord so I can lay the charger in a horizontal position. However, that would mean I have to carry a cord around and I think that would defeat the portability of this charger though. I have found it is easier for me to slow down and put the charger gently into the wall so the batteries don't fall out. I highly recommend this battery charger. 
I bought this charger 11 months ago. It came with 4 Kodak 1850 mA NiMH batteries. After a few months of light use, the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 mA batteries should. If I use the batteries immediately after charging them, I can take about 20 pictures (while my 2000 mA NiMH batteries can do &gt;60). If I charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves, they won't be useful after only a week. The charger is capable of charging both AA and AAA batteries. But a few months ago, 1 spring for switching between AA and AAA stopped working properly. This was after very light use. I only charge AAA batteries once a month. The market for NiMH batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago. I would not buy this Kodak if I were to buy today 
This worked fine at first but after a few months, the charger could not hold the AAA batteries in place. The spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the AAA batteries. Thus, I could no longer charge the AAA batteries. Then after a while, the charger just quit working all together 
This CF card is perfect for anybody who needs a high capacity (e.g. for hi-res pics) but doesn't care about the transfer speed. It may be a bit annoying though - especially if you try to download all the 2GBs from the card to your hard drive because it takes some time. I do still consider it a real good purchase ; 
I am new to digital photography. Till now I have mainly used point shoot film cameras. I purchased this card for my Canon 350D SLR and I am completely satisfied. It stores more than 500 photos at highest quality and I found no delay whatsoever in storing images. The card perfomed very well in continuos shots! People who are complaining about speed must note that this is one of the cheapest branded cards available in the market and should not be compared with higher speed costlier cards 
I had bought a lexar professional 512 when the digital rebal first came out at a whopping $230. It has a write speed of 40x. I needed to buy a bigger card becuase when I took pictures at events I did not have enough memory and had to keep changing my jpeg quality. The kingston was a great choice. Not only did it have four times the memory but a great price to go with it. I would recommend this product to most photographers. The only down side I have had is the write speed claims to be 50x and my lexar at 40x seems to be faster. If you are a action photographer this is not the card for you, this is why I did not give it a five star rating. I went on vacation this month and had plenty of room to spare on the card. It did everything I needed it to do. 
I have been using this on my Canon Rebel XT for about 9 months. I also have a similar CF card made by Sandisk (Ultra II) which I paid much more. I'm fully satisfied with this and don't see any difference in performance between the two. Btw, I shoot in RAW format and the 8 megapixel RAW files are pretty big. 
I love the memory size of the card but however when you want to shoot withing a very shot time frame, the card is slow. An excellent example would be a birthday party. You take a snap and want to take the next one, you may have to wait at times and you may end up losing the shot. (Initially I thought it was okay but when it kept repeating I felt a bit disappointed) I have the SanDisk Ultra II 1 GB and it has never had a delay. I would used this card for situations where I have plenty of time between shots. Maybe a still life. 
This memory card handles the job really well. Unless maybe you're a professional sports photographer, it's plenty fast enough. No problems using it with my Canon Rebel XT. It holds about 550 pictures (JPEGs) at the highest resolution (8.2 MP) 
The card works well in my camera and was purchased at a good price compared to several other sources. No problems with delivery 
Beware of KINGSTON rebates! Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible. I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate. I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way. Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date. My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer). The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1 business cards when flattened. No problem. About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer." Well, now WHAT? I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession). I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said. I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase. After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam. They simply wouldn't honor the rebate. And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements. If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair. If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk. For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products. Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices. Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced. I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams 
Lots of room.. I don't have to worry about running out of pictures- even in RAW format. And a Ton of pcitures in hi-res JPEG format. Plus, it was very affordable. I have no complaints. I shoot with a Canon digital Rebel. I'm very happy with this purchase 
cost is low because the company no longer exists - no tech support, no company website (just be prepared) for Win 2000 and XP, you must download your own drivers - http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/KBGearTablet.zip has at least the XP driver It takes some monkeying to get used to, have to press a little harder than you first expect to get it to do anything. Draws like a charm, best value for mone 
I bought this recently not knowing much about what was out on the market in terms of tablets, and I have some advice if you're going to buy this product. Pros: It's a shame Wacom doesn't make tablets that are 5x7 since I have found out that this is the perfect size- it's not so small that you have no room to draw properly, and it's not big enough that you have to hurt your arm with long movements after a tiring day at work. The price- I bought this for 20 C dollars at the local Radioshack, but you can get one for much cheaper online compared to a Wacom Graphire which is 4x5 and upwards of around 50 US dollars. It's compatible with almost every graphics software and works remarkably well. Unless you're a professional graphics designer, you won't need any of the costly Wacom tablets if you've got this. Cons: When I first unpackaged it, I was tearing my hair out for two days trying to figure out how to make this work in Windows XP. For all of you out there with a similar problem, download this driver for the newer versions of Windows and relax: http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/KBGearTablet.zip The pen sensitivity will need to be set to your desired pressure-sensitivity first, so don't try it out before going to Control Panel and changing the settings. I find that the best setting to use for the barrel button option is Left double-click. :) Hope that helped a bit 
I'm a computer artist and use the jam studio a bunch. Yes there are driver issues. If you tinker with it some you're fine. The software bundle is useless, but it works with any application. I've tried most tablets, a lot of them make me feel like I'm etching glass. The jam studio has a more natural (not to mention perfect size!) drawing surface than the rest. I even like the corded pen. I don't have to go far when it gets dropped. More pressure levels would be nice but not a must. Hey at this price I would buy two. It's a shame the company went under, this product got written off rather quickly...it's too bad 
I did not read the prior reviews, I bought this item &amp; loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from Target.com. The MFG SOFTWARE disc contains TWO VIRUSES one in Quicktime &amp; the other in Totally Hip files. Target has been notified that the software is CORUPT with viruses &amp; that the MFG has gone out of business. This item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no WEB SITE ACCESS or tech support available for this item 
I just received my sketch pad - mainly for the use of playing Isketch (isketch.net) - but I tried it out in my PSP program, and it works just fine in there also. I didn't even use the software/disks that came with it. I have WinXP and got the drivers for it @ http://www.virtualinformation.com/support/index.htm and everything works just fine! :) It does take a little bit to get used to using (been using a mouse for so long) but I love it 
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
This is now my go-to bag. It has excellent build quality and it's pretty much the perfect size. I really like the style and the way it fits, staying very close to my body, and it it easy to pull around to the front. I have mine holding my Digital Rebel with my 70-200 4L, 50mm 1.8, EFS 60mm, and Kit lens. That pretty much fills up the main comparment. The front pocket is big enough for all of my accessories (except flash). I have only 2 minor gripes. 1: The color is a little different than in the online images. 2: The shoulder strap starts off nice and wide, but becomes very thin by the time it reaches my shoulder. Carrying it fully loaded can start to bother my shoulder after a few hours. I think i'm going to have to try to add some padding or widen the strap myself somehow. This shouldn't be a problemif you have lighter gear. It's probably the best value bag i have seen 
This camera bag is better than my $140 Tamrac bag. It holds my D60 camera with a 70 lens attached, my 100-400 lens fits nicely next to it and the pockets provide plenty of room for all the misc. stuff. The quality of materials and stitching are exceptional.The strap is comfortable and versatile. 
I have only had this monitor for a couple of day's but I am verry happy with it. It came well packaged and you cant beat the price. I shopped around and this was the one for me. I dont know about the other review but with in 5 min of opening the box I was using the monitor and it worked verry well!! THANK'S AMAZON 
I had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up...but after a little tweaking, it works beautifully. Previously owned regular CRT...what an improvement! Superb clarity and brightness. For the money you just can't go wrong with this one 
I first tried these blank DVDs and they did not work for me and I was very frustrated. There was clear labeling on the package that new firmware was needed for many DVD writers to work with these discs. However, my DVD writer was a variation of what was listed. So I tried about 10 discs and only 1 worked. Tonight I downloaded the firmware for a variation of my HP drive and all works fine. Bottom line - expect to download the firmware and these will work great 
First Time user of memorex. A friend recommended them. works absolutely perfect. used over 30 of these dvds with only 4 defectives burns and that was because of an OS problem 
Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully. I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media. Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well. I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter. I'd try something else 
... Especially for DVDs. These have been working perfectly for me. I haven't wasted one disk. I had similar problems before when I purchased the incorrect media. I would try and try to burn a dvd and got an error every time. After tons of trouble-shooting, I realized that I needed this type for the hardware that I have. I haven't had one problem since I changed. CHECK YOUR HARDWARE/SOFTWARE prior to purchasing to make sure it is all compatible. It will save you a lot of time and trouble 
I purchased this item and was excited to get them, but burning my first DVDs.. they're all coasters! ARG.. pass Memorex and go for a more expensive media, like Verbatim 
Bad bad bad. I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs, whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable. I purchased a 50 spindle and from the first 28 used only one worked properly. This is an expensive waste. I suggest going with better quality discs at the outset. It will save on headache later 
I would avoid these discs. I have been using these discs for some time doing backups. Recently, I've had a few problems and decided to look at these further. I noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the Memorex brand as are others like TDK, etc.. I used to DVD info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by CMC and I'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors. One disk has strange ring in the die. I have the NEC 1300a burner. I also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer. Less trouble playing on my Sony DVD player. Just based on this (not a clear indication of what you're getting when you purchase), I would go with something else. These discs are not cheap enough for this reason. 
I use the pink circles to buff the cd/dvd, and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd, as I thought it would. Well, I thought that those marks would disappear after I used the repair paste with the yellow circles, but they're still there. Is it supposed to be like this? The reason I bought the thing was to make the cds look like new, but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over. Could someone answer this question for me please 
I've been looking for a way to fix the DVDs our toddler "enjoys". Obviously he shouldn't handle them, but he loves "helping" so how can I resist. Unfortunately he scratched up his favorite DVD to the point it won't play most sections. So this device arrives and I run the repair, buffer then repair, repair and clean. And to my disappointment the disc wasn't playable... until, I tried using more than a few (small) drops of the repair paste. Using three big drops and his DVD is playable once again. I'm repairing and cleaning DVDs from the Library too. If we still had Netflix this would be indispensable. The instructions are clear and the device works quickly. Its pretty noisy though 
I had a rare DVD disc that had developed a tangle of faint cracks, making later tracks unplayable. I used the advice given in an earlier review to use two drops of the repair fluid (aluminum oxide) for the initial cycle and single drops thereafter. This was good advice and made some improvements, but there was persistent stalling and break-up in some tracks. The unit works by having an electric motor spin two cylinders, each of which rubs an annulus-shaped surface against the CD or DVD. The set comes with each repair surface attached to a flat disc with three prongs, mounted into a clear plastic base. The buffing surface comes only on its disc-tripod. To go between repair and buffing, one must use an enclosed small plastic brush-crowbar to pry open the surface between the disc-tripod and the clear plastic base. This is not mentioned in the instructions. Also not mentioned is that one may buff more than once. I ended up buffing four times. This was probably more than necessary. Sometimes one may put on too much of the repair fluid, which may find itself spread unevenly or left in small clumps. The result is that areas of the DVD that had played all right before now break up because of irregularities or waves in the fluid coating itself. My final cycle involved two larger drops, followed by using the repair cycle without putting any extra fluid on. This may have smoothed the coating without the more severe action a buffing would have given. Now the disc works all right throughout. There is some loss of picture sharpness, but it's acceptable. Along the way, I sent the customer service rep at Aleratec two e-mails seeking advice. The responses were fast, courteous, and helpful. The product does work but needs more complete instructions and suggestions. Skill rises with practice. Be patient at first. 
As far as I can tell this thing doesn't work at all. I have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them. I should have just replaced the cds 
I used the repair feature one time and the unit would never turn on again and the disc I did do the repair on still didn't work. Don't waste your money on this 
With boys aged 2 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I'm driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units. Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn't take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children's cds in the car I don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also. I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit. Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products. I'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped. This product repairs a disc to "useable" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible. I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches. It's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance. If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair. I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible. I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair. I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine. My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great. I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair. It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable. I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. 
Much to my dismay, the item arrived DOA, and even tech support was not readily available. I eventually filed an RMA with the seller, but I had to pay for return shipping costs. There apparently is no such thing as "quality control" from the seller in an item as simple as this, and for this I rate this item such. While the replacement works, I would recommend others to not buy this until they have tried the age-old "soap water" solution first 
I use this card in my DSLR and it works as expected. I haven't run into any problems 
I've used many brands of CF card, and some others are slow and sketchy--seem to need reformatting way too often. These SanDisk Ultra cards, however, are blazingly quick when storing images or transferring data and have never given me any trouble at all with data loss or corruption 
I brought this product for my Olympus E-500 Digital camera .It worked fine with camera .If sandisk can come with better firmware update I believe it can performe wonderful with camera .The tranfer speed of data is ok and Sandisk can think about improvement by updated firmware .Overall my experience with Product is satisfied.So far there is crash . Price difference between 2Gb and 1GB is too high ,otherwise I will go for 2GB in the sameproduct line.It come in sealed retail package.I upgraded my camera firmware to latest in order to use this product trouble free 
I have not had any problems with this memory card. It is very fast when taking pictures as well as downloading them. Great Bu 
The card seems to be very high quality. I haven't had any problems so far. It holds about 600 pictures in the large format in my 3.2 megapixel camera. I would definitely recommend it 
So far I havent filled up my disc yet using it. The disc that came with it would fill up after 3 minutes of talking. So far its great 
After purchasing this memory card, I realized I should have purchased it with my camera instead of waiting as long as I did. Before this upgrade, my camera had a maximum of 18 3.2mp pictures. Now I can take 611. I can also now use the video feature of my camera without fear of filling it up. Why wait? This is the best card I could find for the money. If you're thinking about more memory than this, I wouldn't bother unless you take a huge number of photos or have an extremely high res camera. 
Love the Ultra II 1Gb card. I use a lot of SanDisk products without any problems 
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to "reset" and work correctly. It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working. Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand 
I researched what was the best 5 disc changer and this has all the needed features. Continues to get high marks from various consumer groups. Sometimes I have trouble with the automatic play the next dics but I think that is due to a setting I have incorrect. This is the second one I have purchased. First one the power switch is bad we think and it was less money to purchase new than fix. Will probably fix first on the cheap and give to a friend. Then if second one does same thing we know how to fix it. Overall a great playe 
I received this unit via my home insurance after my RCA 5-disc changer was stolen. The unit itself is solidly built, and I don't have any issues with the playback performance or picture quality. I think if you get this unit, you'll be pretty happy with it. What stinks is the documentation, remote, and setup. The manual is your typical poorly-translated engrish guide that most people have come to expect from inexpensive electronics. Fortunately, if you've had any experience setting up a DVD player, there's not much different here. Unless you want progressive scan. Here's what you have to do if you want to use progressive scan mode: 1. Connect both the component cables AND an S-Video (or composite) cable to your TV. Hopefully it has both inputs (most HDTVs do). 2. Put your TV on the S-Video (or composite) input. 3. Enter the Setup menu (not to be confused with the Options menu!) and choose Progressive output. 4. Now you can unhook the S-Video (or composite) cable and put your TV on Component input mode. Thankfully this is a one-time hassle, but it's still assinine that Panasonic couldn't have either designed an autodetect or used a physical switch like my old RCA had. With the RCA, I just hooked up the component cables, flipped the switch, and set up the DVD player for 16:9 aspect ratio and I was done. Lastly, the dreaded H07 error. I think I figured out what's probably causing the majority of them: when you eject the tray, the currently playing CD/DVD is still on the motor and continues to play. A neat feature for swapping the other discs without interrupting your music, but the upshot is that the ejected tray has an empty slot in it. Can you guess what happens if you accidently put another CD/DVD into the seemingly empty slot by mistake? To avoid this, instead of using the Eject function, use the Swap function. This will stop the playback and make sure all the discs are out of the drive and avoid damage. Overall, a great player for the price. Just be careful with it and bear with the tricky setup 
After reading some of the previous reviews, I wanted to state that this player definitely plays back multichannel DVD-Audio discs. If you're only hearing sound out of 2 speakers, then there must be a setting you need to change in the setup menu. Also, I've burned many DVD-R's on various DVD burners (not Panasonic branded) and they've all played back flawlessly on this Panasonic DVD-F87S player. Haven't had any problems with this player and I've owned it for 18 months now. 
It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box. The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would get 'trapped' inside the unit. And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether. Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should. If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully; a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one. Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances. 
I love this DVD player. A huge step up from my old one, which was not a progressive scan. I didn't have too difficult of a time getting used to the controller, which is always a pain when you get a new system. And the on-screen features are fun. I like the ability to adjust the position of the subtitles. I watch movies a lot with them on and it's just nice to have some more freedom with that. Overall, this DVD player isn't the absolute "Best" DVD player out there, but if you're looking for a high quality player for a low budget price, this is definitely the perfect item. 
Excellent quality for its intended use. The price was unbelieveably low,. You can't beat either 
This DVD player is a great, mid-range player that encompasses a wide variety of disc formats. One of the best features is that it can store the exact position of playback for 5 discs so that if you stop watching one movie and move on to another, you can go back the next day and pick right up where you left off. I have tried playing DVDs, DVD+R and CD-R (with JPG images) and all have worked successfully 
I have purchased three of these dvd players in the past 2 1/2 years, every one of them has had the same problems. Trouble reading dvds, dvds skipping, discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units. The price is right on the unit, but not for the time it worked. I would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than 6 months without a problem. If I could give it less than 1 star I would because thats really what it is worth, nothing 
I've had this DVD player for over two years now and it has worked perfectly even with the scratched up DVDs you get from a rental store. I have never put a disc in this player and it not play. Not only is it a wonderful player but it can be set to region free this was a very much appreciated added bonus for me because I buy a lot of Region 2 DVDs. If you are looking for a cheap, very good, and region free DVD player this one is the right choice. The picture is great, the sound is great and its performance is wonderful. 
I bought this player because I wanted to play dvds from various regions. The good news is that it plays discs from all regions outside of region 1 just as well as it plays those in region 1. The bad news is that I never found a disc which the unit could play through in its entirety. It would click, grind and sputter along for 30 or, on a good day, 50 minutes before just freezing up. Save your money or buy a coby dvd-224, which is an infinitely superior unit 
This dvd player is potentially a great, cheap and versatile machine BUT... The two i bought from Worldwide Distributers were faulty. I have a friend who owns a CH-DVD 300 which works perfectly with my Region 2 (English) DVDs. I have a CyberHome DVD player in England which works perfectly as well. The two machine i received didnt work very well and didnt play some discs at all. This is why i would recommend spending a bit more on another machine. After returning two players i decided to buy a Philips DVP5140 (Multiformat DVD Player with Divx, MP3, Windows Media Support) which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly! It cost $60 with free shipping through amazon so wasn't actually much more expensive than the other player! (See the reviews of this player for the code!) I would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the service from Worldwide Distributors and that they refunded most of the shipping costs. The problem was ONLY with the DVD players they sent me 
I ordered the Cyber-Home DVD on 07/21/2006 and so far I have no problems. The quality of the picture is great. I like the fack that the DVD unit is little and fits everywhere, you almost don't see it. It's light and easy to install. Thanks, Kati 
BAD DISC ERROR - possible fix After about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working. I kept getting bad disc error on a new DVD I bought. I tried good discs that worked before but now got the same Bad Disc error. This is not the first time I had problems loading. Previously, unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem. This time after two weeks of Bad Disc errors, I was about to toss it when I decided what the heck, I'll check inside to see if it's dirty or something. FIRST I UNPLUGGED THE UNIT. I removed the 6 screws holding the cover. You may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off. With my expertise knowledge. *eyeroll* I nudged the lense mechanism. It apparently slides to read the discs. I plugged the DVD in and loaded a disc again to see what happens. The lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc. I'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day! lol So hopefully this will last a little longer. But at least I can use it again for now ... I am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error. The viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers 
I use it outside on my deck for watching DVDs in the summer. It is sturdy, easy to move around, and the quality is excellent. I would highly recommend it 
Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's. After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo 
This is a nice product,i buught it beacause i needed to play DVDs from foreign country and my fancy "sony" dvd vcr player can't read them but this little thing can,it reads all the standards i'm glad i've got it. 
I bought this power supply because the breastpump that I used did not have a car adapter. Instead of buying a new breastpump, this Linksys Car Cigarette Power Supply saved the day. It works wonderfully and has a safety mode that will disconnect the power if you are trying to power something out of reach of what the Power Supply can do. It would work wonderfully for laptops as well as other small electrical items that you need mobility with 
It worked. All the labels from the side of the power supply just fell off. Kind of looked cheap, but it did the job 
It came with the stickers all peeling off. Used it for about a month and the item failed on me. Then the bad news, it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working. Tried it on a friends car and I blew his fuses (car and person). Look for something else. Seems to be a common problem. UPDATE: Linksys replaced this product instantly. Works but a little worried it will fail again. UPDATE ON UPDATE: Died again... 
I use this with a Dell Inspiron 8600. It works fine even when the laptop is being used and charging at the same time. I haven't observed the heating problems others have -- it gets only moderately warm 
Bought one several years ago for camping trips. Use it in a Dodge Caravan with a laptop and with gameboys. It takes a beating by 2 boys in the family car. Has always been reliable and worked just fine 
This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec. In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that 
I bought these for my elderly Father who doesn't hear very well. Lets just say, I'm the favorite Son once again 
These headphones do not possess the latest technology, but just work. You do need 'line of sight' to the transmitter, for them to work, but that is just about the only con I've found. They are really comfortable to wear, even after a few hours, but the best thing they have is the battery life. With the supplied rechargeable batteries, they are supposed to last up to 40 hours on a single charge. The longest I've used them is for 12 hours straight and for another 8 hours the next day before recharging them and did not fail. Recharging them is a matter of leaving them on the cradle/transmitter overnight, and they will be ready for the next day. If you go with regular batteries (optional) they are supposed to last for over 60 hours before they need to be replaced, which is a great option, allowing you to use regular batteries after the rechargeable ones finally wear out and get another set. I bought them to use with my computer to replace regular headphones, and installation was as simple as plugging in the connectors, and the transmitter power supply. They just worked. I've also hooked them up to my stereo and TV with the same ease, and am seriously thinking about purchasing another pair to save me from plugging and unplugging them from different appliances 
The first unit worked OK for about a month but then just stopped transmitting, if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about 5 minutes and then stop again. Returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in 2 weeks. Returned second unit for credit and will buy something else. Both units had a lot of static, even at low to moderate volume level 
I bought these headphones to watch TV while on the treadmill. They don't work at all for that purpose. Interference from the motor causes them to cut-out. They work great when I stop the treadmill 
Excellent Headphone System.  The reach is of approximately 3 meters and it is listened very well, it is also quite comfortable 
Great buy! It is easy to use, fun, and helps motivate. 
This is a great product, not olny that combines technology and sports, also gives new meaning to running..just buy it and hit the road 
While the sports kit is very reliable and fun to use, I found it still to be more of an mp3 player than a training tool. Better for the more casual mid-week run than speed work or keeping track of the details of a long training run. This is not to say it's not a great running tool. The website is great and offers a lot of motivation. And, you don't need to be wearing Nike shoes to use this. There are many options on ebay and in sports stores that will attach the pode to your current running shoe. ...but I still like my garmin forerunner better.. 
And that is saying something. This plus a Nano is the ideal road companion 
This device is awesome. I absolutley highly recommend it, especially since I used it on the treadmill and discovered the treadmill, all this time, has given me inaccurate distances. I don't wear Nike sneakers, but it was easy enough to make a little pouch for the transmitter and pin it under my laces onto the tongue of the sneaker. I love that it tracks my runs for me and graphs them so I can see my progress. If you're considering it, buy it, you won't regret it 
This is an amazing product that has pushed me to exercise at another level. Easy to use, tried with old NB shoes and new Nike+ shoes. I did calibration only once, tradmill shows a slighty different reading, but at the end, it has pushed me to record an amazing number of miles that I never thought I could do in a short period of time. 
The Nike+iPod Sport Kit is an excellent addition to the iPod line. Unfortunately, it only works with Nike+ shoes. Which are hard to find and a number of us don't like how they fit or prefer other shoe types. You can still use the Nike+iPod with other shoes. There are a number of home brewed ways and retail products. We like the $5.99 Shoe Pouch. You can find the Shoe Pouch at [...]It will securely attach the sensor to any type shoe. Otherwise, way to go Nike and Apple, great product 
I was very interested in buying this product even before it came out, but I have to say I am disappointed. This product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run, a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill. I say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you, and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run. This product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is. I am a fan of Apple products, have owned 4 Ipod, 2 Ibooks, an Imac and a MacMini but after buying this product I have decided to sell it because it doesn't do any thing that can do on your own. I don't think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they up-charge for that probably into the 60-dollar range. I have been running for the past 3 months on a daily basis, and have run 5K-10K and half marathons in the past. 
 At age 52, overweight with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol, I decided to save my life and buy new nano and nike+ unit here. The unit is a joy to use. Autosync-ing your runs to the nike+ website couldn't be easier. Note I have dial-up only connection (&lt;32kbps). Watching your run data collect on the nice nike+ graphical interface is great fun! As stated by several here, nike+ shoes are not necessary. I put my shoe unit in an unused luggage tag and stuffed between my New Balance tongue and laces. Minor complaint: During workout, I can't fast-forward/reverse within songs that are playing (a minor complaint when one considers I am now running 2 miles daily!) Try the "PODRUNNER" podcast at iTunes to find free and extended workout mixes tailored to your desired beats-per-minute (BPM) 
This is a very good sd card and is a great size for its value. I am using it with the panasonic sv-av20 digital cam and it works perfect for it. plays mp3s great, and can handle video very well. Overall great SD card 
i got the right decision when i brought it. it functionned instantly when i put it in my hp 720 camera. it is provided with a lifetime warranty and you recieve a plastic box to put the card in. it is also the cheapest 128 mb card in the market. beware the transfer speed is 2 mb/ 
Sandeep's review was informative, but for photographers like myself, I'm not going to be too concerned about a difference of 6 MB (actual 122 MB instead of 128 MB). All I'm concerned about is will the card retain the data in a consistent, accurate and dependable manner; not like what happened to the poor guy who lost his using a Sandisk memory card. The price is right, too. I've had this Simpletech 128 MB SD card for 2 years now, and haven't had one single problem with it 
I bought one of these for my Magellan Meridian GPS (green / brown). It works flawlessly and is MUCH cheaper than the Magellan brand Secure Digital Cards. Note: depending upon what version of the firmware you have for your Magellan Meridian, you may need to upgrade to access this large of a memory card 
I never recieved any replacement paln informtion regarding my warenty. I had customer service email stating they would send me the paperwork for the plan but never did. II sure hope when I need to use it I will be able to. 
Some sort of insurance policy is always a good idea for expensive electronics, so this was a no brainer 
I was burned by another company with I bought their product and they didn't offer a replacement plan. The item died and no one can repair it 
I am very happy with my ebookman-901, there are one or two things that I am not too pleased about. Number one being the MMC , once you load one that you have stored books on, back into your ebookman to read later on, is that its takes forever for it to bring the books up to read, also its makes up the ebookman infor., you end up having to download the os applications again or it won't sync. The second thing is its hard finding places that you can find to download music from onto your ebookman. But since I mainly use mine to for ebooks that's is great by me. Thanks again for this product I can carry so my books with me now to choose to read from now 
Straight forward: you should buy this. Here's the pro's and cons Pro's: 1 It has a nice screen, even though it is B, that would never get in the way. The screen is nice and large, perfect for the ebook-type person. With 3 different font sizes, you can see it in your way. 2 It has a lot of features. It has a book reader (Mobipocket Reader, a nice program), MP3 player, Date Book, To-Do, Calculater, Audio Book Player, and Address Book. Plus, you can download programs from places such as Windows Market Place or C Net downloads.com 3 It has handwriting recignition (or a touch screen keyboard). I always found this handy and while it's not always right, the people at Franklin really got this down. 4 The whole thing is touch screen. This means you can play games on it and not be restricted to only a certian area. I had this problem with my last PDA. This also means you can download games. 5 MMC cababilty. You can have gigabytes plus the 8mb on the RAM. The ebookman also allows you to back up data, a handy feature for battery drainage. 6 The software is easy to use. The simple drag and drop-download system is a breeze. While some people say that downloading the OS (operating system) from the site is a pain, they didn't mention that the CD already comes with the OS. 7 Convienient side scroll wheel with push in ability. You can use this instead of the scroll bars, and you can push the wheel in to enter. It's cool! Con's: 1 The batteries go fast! I advise to have a spare set, and back up the data on an MMC. Don't use the backlight, that is what burns it up. The handy thing is that it has a battery indicator, so you know when it is time to change up. 2 Limited file types. The ebookman allows mostly its own versions of files, such as audio books and ebooks. However, it does accept .txt (Notepad) and .MP3 (music), plus a bunch more. 3 While it has a speaker, if you plan to lisen to something you should bring some headphones. The speaker is nice, yet quiet. 4 The date book's alarm is very quick. What is cool about the alarms is that there is over 20 alarms that you can choose. However, the alarm only does one cycle, and then it stops. It uses an internal speaker, so you can barely here it while it is in a pocket. Otherwise, the ebookman is pretty good. While I got this from my aunt and didn't pay a penny, I think that if this is your first PDA, it's a good choice to get it for your money. And if it is true that this is your first time, you also want to get a case, screen protectors, and MMC cards (for more memory). This won't total up to more than $20. Many say the batteries are drained quickly. This is true (in about 2 weeks for frequent users), however if you do not use the backlight much you will be ok. The backlight for the 7 inch screen is the burner of all batteries. Watch the convienient battery power indicator, and you should be ok. That's what I think; the desision is up to you 
I bought one of these when they were on clearance for less than $30 and it works wonderfully. A lot of the complaints out there are because people don't know how to use this device correctly 1) You have approximately 30 seconds to change the batteries. Once the AAAs are out of the unit, the memory is kept alive through the use of a capacitor. I know, I've tried it myself. So don't wait until the batteries are dead to change them. That defeats the purpose. And as with any electronic device, you should have a spare set of batteries on hand. 30 seconds is a lot of time. If you can't change the batteries in 30 seconds, well, then... 2) The little humming noise that I've experienced is only when the backlight is on. This is nothing more than stepped up voltage powering the EL backlight. 3) There is an onboard file manager if you can't find the file you're looking for. You can even assign to each file the folder under which it should appear (to a limited extent - works better with program files). If that doesn't work, then the synch software should display your file. 4) I have a scr***le-like game, pacman, periodic table of the elements, a few songs on my 64MB mmc, some books that were free off the internet, and lots of other neat little programs. Everything works fine. Music quality is amazing for something that i think is slower than my 386DX. Ok, it's not THAT good, but for less than $30 it makes one cheap "mp3" player. 5) The character recognition system is in my opinion, much easier to use and remember than that of other PDAs (Palm comes to mind). It more closely matches how normal people write. 6) You can backup all of your files to a 64MB mmc. That way if you forget to change the batteries in a few months, you can always restore the system from the mmc, which is much faster and more convenient than reinstalling from scratch. Again, all it takes is a standard backup, like you would a PC. All in all, this is a great device. There are a lot of free software out there for this device, and if you know how to use it correctly, it should be a joy to have 
I bought the Ebookman 901 without knowing anything about it, and I have been very pleasantly surprised at how versatile it is. Just add a 128 MB MMC card (which are now pretty reasonable on E-bay) and you can have 2 hours of music to go! I have another 64 MB MMC card in it on which I have all the books I have downloaded. A 64 MB card will hold almost 100 regular books! The MobiPocket Reader is great for casual reading, and the Franklin Reader has all the navigation features to make it great for references. I can read any book in HTML or TXT format, and there are thousands for free on the web. The Ebookman also has some nice accessories like a car stereo adaptor and an AC adaptor for home use. The PDA functions like Address Book and Memo Book and Date Book are very handy. There are some really fun games. I take this unit when I am traveling, and am never bored. I think if you read the manual and learn how to use it properly, you will love this device. And now you can find them on E-bay and Heartland America for less than 50 bucks. WOW 
I've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull. First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries. Pretty simple, huh? Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%. I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it 
This product stinks. Typically, the documentation is not written in standard English, but in some cyber-patois that no civilized person understands. Their support material is exhaustive and exhausting and solves no user problem. I bought it primarily for book reading and, so far, have not been able to access a single one. The "desktop manager" tells me the "synchronization" went ok, but that proves to be false. The stories I downloaded are nowhere to be found. I look under Franklin Reader and find nothing. I look under Mobi Reader and find the same. I don't need another calculator, or memo book, or solitaire game, or voice recorder, or mp3 player, or phone book. I wanted a portable library for fiction, nonfiction, whatever, and this gadget will not give it to me. If you remember the Seinfeld episode in which the foreign professor threw the electronic organizer out the window, you have an idea of what I feel like doing with this thing. I bought it from a clearance company on ebay for 50 bucks, so it's not a huge loss. But I did want an ebook reader. Apparently, there are a lot of ebooks online for the taking (or buying), but I'll never see them, not with the Franklin ebookman anyway. And I'm certainly not going in search of another device. Once burned, twice shy 
Needed a large quantity of CDs for a college course; these did the job nicely 
I used several high speed CD-R disks to burn music CD for my 1998 car. However, they just cannot be readable. But this CD-R has multiple written speeds, so it can burn a great CD suitbale for the old CD in my car as well as new CD of course. 
I've been using these Memorex CD-Rs for years and have no problems with their reliability. Have used them with multiple CD and DVD burners without compatibility issues. This was another re-order and I continue to be happy with this product 
I like these cdrs the payback sounds great, only problem I have is that I use nero and I dont know if its nero or the cdr's sometimes they dont burn right, so I will have to assume its the program or my burner. I like these they take abuse good Cdrs for the money I reccomend i 
We buy these because the price is low and you get 50 cd's in a pack. This is handy for backing up the PC (uh, when DID you last back up YOUR data?) You can put pictures, files, music on these cds. We use them just for data backup, and use Fellowes software and labels to make custom labels with contents. These are filed in an album and it's easy to reload or retrieve data in this manner. We have not had any problem writing or reading these cds 
I have found that, for the most part, if I purchase a name brand product I usually get good quality. These Memorex CD's have been working just fine for me 
the product arrive to me in very good condition, will recommend this product to anyone who needs blank cd 
Not sure what it is but my rom seems to find these disks quicker and likes burning to them because there done faster then others with the same ratings 
best price Great bargain for good quality medi 
I use these primarily to record music compilations from my CD collection... I originally intended to use them in the car during long trips. I was very please and surprised to find that they sound teriffic on my high end stereo rig as well... giving up only the smallest amount of resolution and detail...losses that only an audio nut like myself would detect. 
First off--I'm old(ish) in my 50's and I watched my daughter using her iPod nano. Then she started playing me songs from her iPod, then I started really liking some of the songs, then I got jealous, so I asked for my own for my birthday. So I got the biggest and newest, and I love it. It has fantastic sound. I play it in my car. I also use it to listen to audiobooks. I can't wait to watch movies on it. It is also very easy to use. So I give it 5 stars 
I love my new iPod. I bought this one after my 60GB iPod Photo was "misplaced". I had a library of about 6,000 songs (small for what this thing can hold) and the first time I updated the new iPod with the library I got error messages every 700 songs or so. I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time). Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are. That didn't happen with my old iPod. But all in all, it's a great product and I would buy it all over again if I had to 
When trying to download information to the Ipod, I keep getting error messages reading Ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the Ipod. Sometimes the software will recognize the Ipod and other times it won't. I have installed and reinstalled the software several times, but it does not seem to fix the problem. 
I have the 60GB black video iPod and it's awesome. Sleek, well-designed, sexy and built like a little tank. I love iTunes, and the latest version is great 
What else can I say but "it's excellent!!! I enjoy using it, traveling with it, using it to carry music and video's, and talking books, back and forth to work. The only thing it needs is a convienient way to hook it up to my car speaker system with out major surgery 
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME. THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD 
I love it, but I think I would like the the 80GB ipod 
I am happy with my purchase. I haven't had a chance to test it fully yet but it has been performing as expected to this point. And with 60G (twice the capacity of my laptop!) I've got a lot of room to work with 
I have a number of toys in my older age, and the Apple I-Pod is clearly a favorite! I use it in the car. I use it with my high-end home system. I use it for music enjoyment first and then and occasional audio book. I also use it during a workout. When I travel or get stuck waiting somewhere for something I will use the video. All the functions work great. It's easy to use and it does so much it's just about ridiculous. It's the Mother of all gadgets. If you buy one (and you will be glad) I recommend getting a protective case for it just to keep it looking like new. This compact wonder is one of the few things in life that will give me my moneys worth (and more). 
Hi, I recently got this system from overstock.com and put it with the Philips 23" flat screen LCD TV I bought from Amazon.com. Together these are great. I have had no problem with the DVD play and I love having a radio tuner built in... one less appliance needed and with lovely sound. Granted, I live in a small apartment and I doubt I would turn the sound up to really take advantage of the system (don't want the neighbors calling). But for the price it is perfect and the two together look great in my home and perform very well 
While the price for this HTS is very nice, the performance is substandard. There's a hissing sound when the unit is off. The DVD player has trouble playing DVDs. I have a large DVD collection most of them don't play. The surround quality is also very poor. It's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don't put out much sound. In order to get this serviced, I have to send it out for up to 3 months. I bought a progressive DVD player, put the audio through the Phillips HTS 3400 and the video to the TV and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better. 
The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies. It drove me nuts. I had to return it. 
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics. I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and A. Isaicu all talke about these problems 
I purchased this amazing Home Theater system at Sam's Club. I also purchased a Phillips plasma tv. Together these two make beautiful music. When i first heard this amazing Home Theater, i couldn't believe how good it sounded. It reminded me of a more expensive Bose system for a fraction of the price. My friends always ask me how much i paid for it thinking i spent a fortune, but i did not. I paid $189 on sale. I even use it as my regular home stereo. I gotta tell you, my CD's have never sounded better. The subwoofer produces amazing deep bass and the highs are out of this world. Get this, you won't regret it! P.s, I've had mine for 3 weeks with no problem at all!!! 
It came down to a choice between a $40 sound system with a seperate dvd player or this $200 system. The reason I purchased it was because it would save on space. Well, it may save on space, but the functionality was reduced to nearly ZERO. The cons: -Audio popped in and out when playing MP3 CD's. Also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio. -Hissing (especially from the rear speakers) when the unit was turned off. -Low volume from the rear speakers. -Didn't play many DVD's right (it would just stop, as if it couldn't read it). -Will not read DVD-R/RW's. -STUTTERING PICTURE. It did this on ALL DVD'S PLAYED. Every few seconds (it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences) it looked as if it would drop a few frames. The audio never varied from being spot on, but it looked as if the player couldn't keep up with the DVD. This is what killed it for me. This COULD BE because of a defective unit, however, I will not be risking my money on another Philips player. The pros: -Good audio output. That's about it. My expectations were disappointed HORRIBLY. I will not be buying another philips if I can help it at all. Instead, I bought a Sony slimline DVD player($75 with a $40 sound system) and it is far superior. Far. AND it plays DVD-R/RW's 
July 31st 2005: I was looking for a DVD player for my bedroom at Costco and couldn't resist the $179 price for this brand new Philips HTS3400 (HTS3410 is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than silver/black). I played some DVDs and CDs and after 2 days i decided to return it for 2 reasons: 1. It makes a hissing sound when it's turned off. Now, it wouldn't bother me too much in a basement (althought it would still be anoying), but it's a definite NO NO in the bedroom. 2. Rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them. If you don't mind these 2 things, then by all means go for it. Aug 2005 UPDATE: Having nothing better to do, I went and purchased another unit from Costco to see if indeed I have a bad unit or it's a design/manufacturing issue. Surprise surprise...second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder! Curious enough (i'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics) i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from. It is the AC/DC transformer, more specific two 330uF capacitors making this noise. That is really poor design and/or low quality components!!! I did not expect this from a brand name like Philips. This is no different than any no name units out there at half price. As a result I am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product, this one is definately not worth the money. I cannot update the stars but this time I would rate it with 0 stars. Oct 2006 Update: It stopped reading CDs but it reads DVDs no problem. Returned to Costco! 
Works very well. I ran my CD and DVD "test subjects" thru about 10 times and the discs would physically start to curl up, like a potato chip. Which would further prevent any attempt to read them. Of course, I was just playing around with this new toy, but I think just once thru the unit will really mess up any chances at recovery of data. Also, my box, bought via Office Depot included FIVE software titles: [reportedly worth $149.99] 1. Hacker smacker - firewall 2. Stop Spam 3. Internet Cleanup 4. Stuffit - standard edition 5. Restore it 3 And 2 more bonuses: 1. FREE subscription to the spamslicer program [Home edition] or $50.00 off the business edition. [I'm not going to type it all out, but details of what spam slicer is and the program available to anyone that buys this unit, are available at (...)]. 2. ID theft prevention - (...) FINAL CONCLUSION: I think this item is more than sufficient for the home and/or small business user. Norazza company offers larger data disc destroyer units for folks that need to destroy massive quantities of discs, on a regular basis. 2 thumbs up 
I was looking for an innovative product that could quickly and affordably destroy a large number of cd/dvds. I work for a small business and we have lots of disks to be destroyed on a regular basis. This was an instant solution and very affordable. We are so pleased that we plan on making it mandatory to have on everyone's desktop! DON'T HESITATE, BUY IT NOW!!! 
I work for a small business and we can't afford the risks of data theft. Having this unit has put my mind to ease, especially since I work with very sensitive data. If you love gadgets, this is an extremely cool product to have. Its sleek and within seconds destroys your data. Its very compact and heavy duty, so its durable and can easily fit in a home office, as well as any place at work. You just insert the disc and within seconds thousand of tiny imprints are made on both sides of the disc making the disc unreadable. This is a great product because it securely destroys the data without having to shred the disc and having shattered broken pieces of plastic everywhere. For anyone who has owned or operated a disc shredder, they are very messy. This is an excellent alternative. Is so quick and easy to use, anyone can operate it. This should be a household requirement, as much as any other appliance in your home. I received my Norazza Data Destroyer within a couple days of placing my order which was very fast service. I strongly recommend this product for personal as well as for business use!!! 
He usado esta memoria desde marzo de 2004 y la adquir� por su compatibilidad con LINUX. Hoy d�a la mayor�a cumplen con esto, pero en aquella �poca no todas ten�an este requisito. La memoria cumple muy bien con todas sus funciones, a�n que a veces tuve problemas con la tapa al meter el producto en el bolsillo y esta se sal�a. Pero en fin, solo hay que tener un poco de cuidad y listo. Sugiero a la fecha los productos Lexa 
i dont speak english, i am from Paraguay.. your product is verry good... thanks 
For an inexpensive jump drive I found this one to be very good. It was easy to use and convenient for transferring pictures from my computer to a printing station at the local photo developers 
This is truely an awesome product, it is so easy to use and holds a ton of data. 
Pros -Smaller than other flash drives -Has a lock switch -Has a ring so you can hook it up with your keys. -Survived being washed in the washing machine. I waited a day for it to dry up. When I plugged it back in the pc the data that I had before remained intact. Cons -Plastic purple body scratches easily, especially if you keep it with your keys. -128 mb might be a little too small for some people 
I bought my Lexar 128mb JumpDrive when the cost was much higher, and I still consider it a bargain. Large enough for most storage requirements, small enough to carry around in my pocket -- it's a perfect solution to so many computer needs! I have to switch files among several computers: my Mac at home, my PC at work, a Mac laptop and a PC laptop. I don't know how I did it before I had my Lexar 
I puchased this jumpdrive over 2 years ago and I have no complaints in fact I would like to purchase the 1 GB jumpdrive 
This is a fantastic product. I use it to store work on and my boss and I swap back and forth using each other's jump drives. Great for making your business portable 
Nine bucks??? for 128mb??? I still have a lap top with a 250mb hard drive. This little baby is so low priced and convenient it makes zip disks and cdr's seem just stupid. The clear colored plastic is cool because you can see the guts. This one is a no brainer if you want to be able to grab stuff on the fly. Don't leave home without it 
I didn't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning. The cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned (30 minutes) It didn't 
This product really does make a difference. I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all. I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine. Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player 
I was ready to replace the CD player in my Honda Odyssey, much skipping and would not even play many of my CDs. Two quick cycles with this product (less than two minutes) and the player is as good as new 
Over the course of the last few months my CD player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a CD at all. 5 minutes after my package arrived with this CD cleaner in it and I was playing CDs again. I can also play CDRs now, something my stereo hasn't been able to do for six months 
My CD player was very dusty and it would not play very clearly. I used this product and it helped greatly 
When you first look at this cleaner one can't think how simple! It looks like a Compact Disc with tiny brushes on it. My CD player was not playing correctly. After using the cleaner it works perfectly. Great product 
I bought for our computer cd-rom because it wasn't working properly and once i put in my cd cleaner it started working very good so now everytime the cd-rom on my computer starts acting up and just pop in my cd-rom cleaner and it's good to go 
this product is awesome. like another reviewer , i had a problem with my cd player playing my homemade mix cds. but i used this cleaner and 30 seconds later everything is perfect!!! thanks 
When I first started using this, I loved it. It worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound. In fact, I bought a second one for my wife. Then, after about two weeks, it stopped working. It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time. I tried contacting Coby's support on the Web, but they were unresponsive. Luckily, Amazon took it back for a refund. Note that they no longer sell these directly. Bet they had too many returns.. 
i first bought a monster product equivalent in bestbuy, and it absolutely sucked. after buying this i am very happy i did. It works just how it says it does 
Before I had this, I had a generic cassette adapter. The sound was horrible and it made a terrible, tinny echo. I bought it for my Ford Taurus which costs $800 to add a CD changer to. My wireless FM adapter sounded better than my generic cassette adapter, and it was static city since the antenna is on the opposite side of the car (station wagon). I was pleasantly surprised when I got this adapter to replace my old one. The sound quality is better than the strongest FM station here, and the coiled cord really reduces the mess in my car. I only had one problem with this, and I think that is because of my car stereo, but I will note it anyway. After 10 minutes of playing, my car stereo would switch to side 2, then side 1, and display TDE1 and eject the tape. After getting very angry, I found a solution. Simply take the adapter apart, spray WD40 on all the gears, and remove the small gear assembly that prevents the rape from being rewound (was this even necessary? there is no physical tape so it doesn't matter if someone tries to rewind it). Problem solved! I would definitely get this over any other adapter 
Somebody was thinking when they designed this adapter. The plug that works for either style cassete player, the one where the small end of the cassete goes in first, or the one where the wide side goes in first. Plus the curly cord that doesn't get in the way. The big bonus is the price, it's half the cost of the Monster adapter, and it works great. The reviews of the Monster adapter are very poor. I first bought a DLO Transpod 2 FM Transmitter, big mistake. The sound was about 80% static as there wasn't any line of sight between the Transpod and the car antenna. If you have a car where the antenna is molded into the rear window, it probably would work better. Anyway this adapter and my iPod sound great over my car stereo. There are a few car cassette players that won't work with a adapter, if one adapter doesn't work, none will 
I agree with the others that have provided a favorable review. I am pleasantly surprised with many aspects of the product. It feels like a quality product. It is very quiet in the player having only a light sound of "clicking", which does not impair the reproduction of the music. The sound is very clear and not distorted. I am very pleased with it. 
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother. Maybe it seemed a little quiet, but that depends on the volume adjustings... I might buy another for the other car. And, its value definitely exceeds the price that I paid. : 
This adapter would not work AT ALL in my 1996 Ford Ranger. The vehicle's cassette player kept ejecting it. However, it DID work in a co-worker's 1993 Ford Ranger. It also would not work in a 1993 Monte Carlo...same problem 
I used to buy Energizers and Duracells at $3-4 a pop for four batteries. Now I buy generic Alkalines at Costco. Cost: $8 for 10 four packs. It's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer. According to a recent coprehensive story in Consumer Reports, there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries 
theyre friggin' batteries. what else can I say. they last ok and cost ok. no big deal 
I have used Energizer Batteries for many years and I have found that they work much better than Duracell or anyother battery. These batteries are especiall great for handheld devices like walkmans and Gameboys. the battery life is extrodinary 
For the most part I just want to keep it short. I usually always by Energizer cause they're reasonably priced and seem to last much MUCH longer then most other battery products that I have used in the past 
these batteries are as good as any and well priced to 
These batteries are great, and seem to fit my Rio 500 better than some discount batteries. Good price too 
These are by far, the best batteries you can get. They last 5 times longer than standard Alkaline batteries, they look cool, and they weigh almost nothing. You'll love being able to save lots of cash by not constantly running to the store for batteries, and the fact that your portable electronic will weigh less! I've used these numerious times in many different electronic devices, and I LOVE THESE BATTERIES! TRY THEM! You won't be sorry 
I really like this key board. I find it to be verys responsive and unlike some other reviewers I haven't found that I have to press the keys and longer or harder then I do with a normal keyboard. I often leave a gaming keyset on even when I'm not playing. My only complaint is that there is not a good instruction manual. I got this keyboard mainly to play WOW. As anyone knows there are many commands in that game and in that respect the learning curve to fully use my keyset has been a little high. I also have the Age of Empires III keyset and I have the same complaint. All in all I am very happy with this product. I only wish it had better support 
I ordered the keyboard and BF2 keypad combo for $53. The BF2 keyset comes from Tigerdirect and shipped immediatly. The Zboard shipped from Amazon took a week to ship and 11 days to arrive??!! ummm.. someone explain this one to me? amazon? The product is great tho-it has all the necessary keys. believe me, Ive tried the merc, nostromo2, and the zboard Fang, all of those didnt have critical keys. like change vehicle position or camera, or map. But for some reason on all their zboard units they swap enter/exit with cycle weapons. E with F. WHY?? I liked enter/exit where it was and was used to it. I never used cycle weps, i would just hit the number key for that wep or scroll the mouse (both faster), *sigh* I wish these guys would just quit thinking they know better how to lay out my controls. They could just give us a pad of some sort with all map-able keys and let us set it up to suit us, but they have to muck it up. At least just leave the keys postions alone guys. 
The ZBoard is the next best thing to having a voice activated keyboard that writes for you. Its great for anything you want to do. If your a gamer, get this keyboard, it has changeable keypads for all the best new games and it helps a lot! If your new or experienced this is a great keyboard. And the best part is, it works for typing as well. The ZBoard has a layout specifically . designed for typing AND searching on the web so it's good for everyone not just hardcore gamers. I love this keyboard. 
The Good: When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited. I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen. But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it. The Bad: The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard. The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much. The Ugly: About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead. I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail. I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH! They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit. Conclusion: The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good 
This is a very good keyboard for games 'cause it's cool to have bigger directional keys, very comfortable. It's kinda hard at the beginning to type because now u have like a reduced version of ur keyboard in the right side, but it's just a matter of time and practice. Very good keyboard, I really like it 
The Z-Board is great. But If you are playing Battlefield 2 and then switch to the ZBoard you are in a fix. The controls are totally different and very hard to get use to. If you start with it, it might be alright but I think the regular keyboard will be just fine 
I purchased the Zboard after seeing it for sale in the store. I have long wanted a keyboard that made gaming easier and this seemed to fit the bill. The keyboard is easy to use with its interchanging lay overs for normal qwerty style typing or its many custom game styles. Although it took a little getting used to a first, I have found that gaming goes smoother and easier now. Equally important, no more mistaken keyboard keys being hit while in active, bullets flying, bombs bursting, combat. I have used the Battlefield 2 set and qwerty set. The only downside to the keyboard is that if you intend to type a message while gaming, you will get really screwed up trying to figure out where the keys are now located on the keyboard. I try to use the in-game speech channels instead of typing. Was it worth the money? Yes certainly after I bought it on Amazon.com where the cost was lower, so after shipping I saved a couple of bucks under the suggested retail price on the company web site (and no shipping expense on top of that) 
Well constructed and worked right out of the box. We are anxious for more gaming templates. How about templates for MS Flight Simulator and the different planes? 
hello as i said this keyboard made my play a lot easier with the shortcute that it have on it and i can change the keys as i like from game to game but i hope they expande the coverage of the games that they have there keys it worth to try it 
The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them. That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go. We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash. Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping. This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste. Save your time and money and buy another machine 
I bought this DVD player after my Sony player died prematurely. Is it just me, or are DVD players supposed to have a longer life?? This DVD player looks nice and works fine when it is working. The player is a bit noisy when reading the discs, though. But the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only 1 year of use. I expected an improvement over my Sony player and I am sorely disappointed 
good while it lasted, POS broke yesterday for no reason, won't read anything i put in it, phillips customer service was no help, I have to buy and new dvd player... and it won't be a phillips 
I bought one... Just bought 2 more. This DVD player is a gem for the money. I'm on a very busy schedule so I can't verify what I'm going to say here, but I belive I'm playing HD on this unit. I downloaded some HD clips thru bittorrent and usually have to play these on my pc connected to the HD monitor. I copied these AVI and MPEG clips to a dvd, popped them in this player and watched outstanding clear HD quality vid on my HDTV monitors. I don't know if there is some upscanning or down scanning going on between this dvd player and my NORCENT 32" HDTV, but my eye is seeing 1080 resolution and images so sharp I cna see the goose bumps on an olympic swimmer.  I don't know about reliability, but there's junk in all batches of china made electronics. But if this player was sold for $[...] I would still buy one of them after seeing hd quality content on my monitor.  I'd say unless you're spending your last $[...], buy this unit and take a chance on the claimed quality issues here. I'm sold! Bill www.streetglo.ne 
I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon. It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections. the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it. But like other reviews, it stopped working after 3-6 months. In my case, it was 3 months. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead. I don't watch DVDs much, so it's not like I overused it. Go with another model. This one has problems. I thought mines would be the exception, but I guess not. And now I can't return it because it's been over 30 days. 
THIS LITTLE PLAYER PERFORMS EXCELLENTLY-----THE REMOTE TAKES A LOT OF GETTING THE FEEL OF IT, IF YOU ARE IN THE DARK.USE THE FORMALA AND IT TURNS INTO A MULTI-REGION PLAYER. THE DVD PLAYER IS EXCELLENT BUT THE ROMOTE COULD DEFINITLY BE IMPROVED 
I was looking for an affordable DVD player and found this one. It has been working very well for nearly a month and I am very satisfied. It cannot play absolutely everything but it is a bargain especially if you don't play too different DVD formats. Recommended 
This DVD player played movies which I could not run even on my laptop. Almost every CD DVD in my huge movie collection written using a variety of different formats (divx, mpeg, etc) all ran smoothly without absolutely any problems. For the price this deal is a steal 
Well, this is a simple USB 2.0 hub. Everything worked as advertised. I had a problem when plugging the AC unit into a socket that already has another power adaptor from Compusa. It made my Compusa adaptor whine 
Great product. Never had a single problem with it to date, and I've now been using it for 2.5 months. Plug and play and that's it. Beauty. I'm considering ordering a 2nd one for all my usb1.0 stuff 
I have been using this D-Link hub for about six months. The power light started flickering after about three months and now doesn't light at all. The hub works great, but I wonder how long it will last 
For my older PC this made it easy to access a USB 2 port without crawling around to the back of the computer. It does require power for full functionality but does just what I need it to do for a reasonable price 
We bought this powered hub for a desktop because some of our devices were not being recognized as USB 2.0 and we finally tracked the problem down to a power issue. The D-Link was immediately recognized by Windows XP. Further, TWO devices, that previously registered individually as USB 1 when connected directly to a USB port, were immediately shown as USB 2 when both were simultaneously connected to the hub. The price was right as is the performance. We recommend it 
I had been using a Belkin F5U021 4-Port hub. My computer was constantly reporting Low USB power, I'd have to unplug something to get something else working. Since I replaced it with the D-link. No more Low USB messages; No more un-plugging. As a matter of fact I had previously replaced my LinkSys router (which I had to reset from time to time) with a D-Link. I've never had to reset the D-Link. Obviously, D-Link makes very good products. I highly recommend D-Link products 
Does just what it says it will do. Was easy to install. 
I use my USB hub every day and it works fine with every device I plug into it 
I've had this hub for two months and have had no problems with it. Installation was a snap, as it should be for a basic hub. The hub is small and a bit too light, but it's definitely not for laptop users, as it needs an AC adapter. The power brick is actually smaller than most other brick-style adapters and rises straight up from the prongs, saving you space on power strips that have the plugs aligned vertically or on wall outlets (a nice touch). I have an iPod and a multifunction printer attached to the hub, and have had no problems with either. A word of warning, however--as other reviewers have noted, if you plug a USB 1.0 device into the hub, all USB 2.0 devices will slow down to 1.0 speeds 
This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices 
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
PROS Small Cute Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup. USB 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well. Runs cool. CONS Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them. The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated. Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough. Overall good value for price 
This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs). It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer. And I still have 3 more ports. And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub. It does what it says 
This system is just what I wanted. It is small, powerful and easy to us 
This truly was so easy to set up including programming all the wonderful features. The sound is fabulous and the unit is so compact and looks very nice. I'm very happy with my purchase and the price was great too 
Wonderful sound and nice bass...small and compact.. easy directions to understand.. remote simple to use..just a great complete uni 
I've had it for about 2 months already, and it has worked without any flaws. The only thing you have to be aware is to use good media to burn audio cds and MP3, because if not it will skip seconds while playing. But other than that, sound is perfect and it has lots of power for it's size. You won't go wrong with Panasonic 
This Panasonic is all right, except I would die to get my old Sony system back. They just don't have the sound quality at Panasonic that Sony had with these small systems. I don't like that I don't have a clock display at all times and sometimes the CD changer is confusing to me, but it will just take time to figure it out. Since these kind of bookshelf stereos are becoming more obsolete, I am happy to have this one. With all the sound quality of the Sonys I have owned (I've gone through a half dozen) it will please me if this just hangs on and does not become a disappointment in functionality. I would like this one to hang around longer. Hopefully, the CD reader will not go out like my Sonys did 
Hands down, this is the best budget stereo system for the price. Period. 
The Panasonic CD player has a good sound quality, but does not automatically change from one CD to the next. It requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one CD to another. This feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications, and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five CD's 
I recently bought this stereo for my living room. I'm very very satisfied. It was pretty easy to set up. The sound is also very wonderful. The bass and treble features are great too. 5 disc changer is a plus. I recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a good stereo. *note- iPod users need to buy a line-in in order to plug their iPod into the music port. 
I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner. Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint. Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band. It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses. The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual. Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning. Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector. It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota. The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling. The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture. 
It was very easy to put together and takes up minimum space. However, the sound is not minimal and is great for my needs. I particularly like the equalizer for both my pop and classical music. The radio, with the antenna, has great sound with little static. The cd player is great for my needs; easy to play just one cd or the entire deck. My only quibble is that it has a single cassette deck and is not auto reversible. But that's a small price for having a system with great sound. Instruction book, as most books are, could use a little ironing out but I was able to get started and if you have set up a shelf system before, this should be a breeze. If you haven't set one up before, you should have no trouble 
I mainly bought this for its reliability, # of outlets and (most of all) the CleanPower feature. Funky / dirty AC power is one of the leading causes of shortened life expectancy for electronics. Some things I noticed: Yes, it is plastic, but it has that good, thick plastic feel, NOT the cheap thin stuff that seems like it would crack when dropped. It can be hung in virtually any direction (horiz, diag, vert) from two screws/nails by two plus-sign (+) hole patterns on the back of the unit. The cord is long and thick. The plug is a wall-hugging 90-degree angle type that can be used in either the top or bottom outlet receptacle. Huh? It is not only wall-hugging but it doesnt hang straight down from the receptacle - imagine you plugged this into a clock face: the plug would be angled toward the "4" or "5" on the face so that you aren't limited to plugging it in the bottom plug. You could actually have two of these plugged into the same outlet. Enough about that... The plug connectors are REALLY tight fitting. You'll see what I mean when you go to plug in the computer or whatever. ALL Monster outlets are this way, and are intended to help keep the plug from falling out or being ripped out by accident. Another way Monster Cable thinks about the small things that bug us. Mine came with a phone cable that was a couple feet (or so) in length. Cool, now I can plug the fax through the connectors on the unit. (Nothing to report there.) The power switch lights up in red. Comes with labels to help indentify BOTH ends of the power cabes you are plugging in. The three "transformer" positions are great for those old box plugs for the cameras and such. Plenty of room built in. I HIGHLY recommend this unit for your computer 
This is the 3rd surge plug that I have purchased. The first one met an untimely death do to a major water spill from a fish aquarium, but all the equipment attached to it survived. All in all, these plugs are the best. Each plug is labled and you get tags to label your cords (a nice feature if all your plugs are same color and style). the added area for power packs is a nice touch as those take up so much room 
It is worth the $$$$. I hooked up all my electronics to it. The plugs are held extremely tight, and they will not fall out. The picture on my Monitor is less shaky. Also, the cord on it is extremely long, and the plug is almost flat to the wall. It is also a great deal because it comes with labels for the wires, and locking cable ties. I have bought one for my PC, and TV 
I just bought a new computer and I new if I ever needed a new surge protector, monster would have what I need. This baby has it all. Clearly marked, 3 prong, plugs for the computer, monitor, printer, scanner, modem, speakers and two extras... It also includes phone line protection from impulses and discharges caused from surge pulses (you need this! without this, I've lost two modems from storms 30 minutes away!). It includes a since 8ft long power line which is heavily insolated. Other bonuses include the 1665 joule rating, the 24k gold contact grounded plug, little stickers to mark your cables with and a Monster phone line cable. I also like its attractive look. Most are white and stand out. Since this model is black, it appears a little secluded on my desk. But that's not all. You're backed with a grantee this baby will not fail. If it does, you are covered my Monster's insurance! That's worth 50 bucks alone 
I purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad. It will run my cable modem, router, PC, and LCD monitor for 5 minutes. This is more than enough time to save work and shut down. Equally important, I know that my electronics are receiving clean power. I feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply. As always, Amazon had it to me in &lt;2 business days 
First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin 
We bought this to backup the iMac G5 that I got my wife for Christmas. I have had an APC since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area. The overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money. I'm not sure if the Powerchute software was updated to run on Mac Tiger, howvever, so I did not install it. Steve Reis 
It's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw -- beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power. This person obviously didn't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the UPS. The notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software. I agree that I was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem. Luckily, it was easy to turn this feature off. Five stars for this product, for sure. 
I ordered 3 APC Back-UPS ES 500s on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at APC. I've had them for about a month now without any problems. They've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions. I'll gladly order more if the need arises. Pros: - Large plug spacing, good for power adapters - Simple design - Long cord Cons: - No line conditioning (usually an expensive option 
I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage. 
I already knew how good this product was before we bought it. We had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer. I have recently learned I might have been able to have that replaced if I had thought to follow up. But I was just so thrilled to have only lost an $80.00 (at that time) product and not a $1,200 computer. When ordering mine, the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one, I got free shipping, I never even had to leave the house! I couldn't be happier!! 
Wish the unit had a separate online/offline light. When power to the unit is missing, the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds. The warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it isn't always easy to tell what is happening 
Electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks, usually at night, but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day. Very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work. This backup battery takes care of that problem very well. It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works. No linux software but it can still be used without it. The unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery. I have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it 
Sandisk CF is all I use.I have never had a problem. One card went through the wash and still works perfectly 
I purchased this memory card for a camera I was also purchasing. It was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page. When I received the card first and then the camera, I was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit. Because I had opened the plastic package to the card, I was unable to return it. In fact, when I emailed the company who sent it, I never even received a response. 
In general, I have realised that CF cards have a 1-2 years life. This is my 3rd CF card in 5 years, and my 2nd Sandisk card to-date. My first (also Sandisk) is still working, but its only 32MB so not very useful on long trips except as backup. With a 5 Megapixel Canon, this 512Mb card stores about 200 highest resolution images. Have used this for only 3 months so far, but have noted that the Ultra II is definitely faster than others. Quality and life seems to be better than the Viking cards I have used, but time will have to tell how true that is 
my compact flash card works just fine good here very fast. a very happy custome 
I was thinking about buying a 1G card, but after reading one of the reviews,I bought two 512 card,just in case that something went wrong. Which to me made a lot of sense. I'm please 
I bought this card about 6 months ago when I received a Nikon Coolpix 5700 as a gift. I have to say, this card has never let me down. It writes images like there's no tomorrow, and it hasn't failed me once. I haven't lost a single image, and I don't plan on it while using this card. SanDisk has done it once again. Buy from Amazon, I paid $20 more @ Staples for it 
I'm not beholden to the SanDisk brand, and did quite a bit of research, and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value. In fact, the "Ultra II" title does live up to its name, and am very happy with the performance of this product. Canon 350D takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode, and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace, even at the highest resolution. Download is speedy, too. I went for two 512MB cards instead of a single 1GB card, for redundancy (keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer), and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason. Highly recommended 
I have always been very pleased with the SanDisk products. I would highly recommend them 
After reading reviews on every brand sold at Amazon I picked Pioneer since it was about the only brand that didn't have any complaints. I have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent. It uses DVD- disks only but since I never have used DVD+ disks that option is irrevelent to me. 
When I first got the headphones, I was frustrated...they seemed quiet...not much bass...didn't sound that great. What I've read in other reviews is very true. Having them seated in your ear properly makes ALL the difference! I don't normally like things inside my ears, but I pushed it in farther and made them seat right...and now...VERY nice. Not as loud as my other pairs of headphones...but they don't need to be. They also cut out like 25-35db of outside noise...which means you don't need as much volume. I've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though I wasn't listening to music at the time. I hope you enjoy them as I do 
Great sound quality, although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt. I recommend keeping the setting on "Bass" because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak. Prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear. The case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of effort/time it takes to get them properly in there. Other than those minor issues, its great...I prefer these over any sony/ipod/or creative earbuds. 
One thing you will read in reviews when people first use the IM716 headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running. Had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are NOT reccomended to use while running, bycycling or driving a car. I use them for long airplane flights, long walks between classes and relaxing at home, and these headphones are fantastic. Once you get it situated in your ear correctly, it takes a few tries to figure it out, you won't want to take them off. They are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible; this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format. If all of your music is encoded in .mp3 at 128kbs you arn't doing yourself justice. I have some songs in apple losses and some in ACC 192kbs (w/ vbr) and I am very happy with the sound quality. The clip, located about 6-8 inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla, Bass and High Definition. The Bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly (for those who complain that the earphones aren't loud enough) and the High Definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them. They are worth MUCH more than the 67.00 I paid for them 
These earphones are great quality. The sound is good and they fit comfortably in the ear once you get used to them. Two minuses make them only 4 out of 5 stars: first, the customer support is weak. There is supposed to be a website for the product for customer support and replacement parts, but Altec Lansing his it linked to a seemingly unrelated product; second, the volume control is a little heavy unless you have somewhere to clip it to (this might be a problem for runners) 
I purchased these headphones because I needed isolation from noise and these did the trick. The sound quality is great and the quality of the headphones themselves is first rate. The noise isolation is good for work, planes, anywhere the noise level is too high. Irecommend them for the price 
First,these phones are great but I want them in black.Now if you don't get a good ear seal they will sound horrible.The treble is silky,the mids are natural and the bass is tight,well defined and deep.I should know bass,I'm a bass player of 40 years and it's like being at a live show.Amazon sells these for $73 with nextday shipping.Get yours NOW.They take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price,it's the best deal out there.The sound quality is amazing.My sony 71s are history.Enjoy from Bassin J. 
After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them. 1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site. $70 is a steal. 2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak. 3) Performance: Bar none best I've had. These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in. These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. 4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way. When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise. This can get quite annoying. I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module. It is removeable and I was able to bend it back. If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route. With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod 
This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in "hi-fi" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion. The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening. 
I had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since I work in a loud environment. I had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews weren't favorable. I was nervous. However, I bought these because of the name Altec Lansing has in audio. I was shocked when I first listened to them. I had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable. But wow! The clarity of these phones are incredible. No matter what others said about these, I found the bass to be tight, but not booming. If someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs, then they need to stay away from headphones period. If you are searching for a pair of IEMs, then if I were you, I would seriously consider this pair. Just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way, which I never really found that to be an issue. I don't really understand what others were doing wrong with that. If you bought these, I highly recommend it, you would not be sorry. I am thouroughly impressed with mine 
Grossly over-priced and useless - Sony's $10 headphones sounded just as good. The headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best 
This product works well. You can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders. Theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside. I can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient 
I was so excited to get this for my iPod. I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy. There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit. If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box. 
great produce. much more conveinient when you have multilpe riders in the car so that they can share 
After I bought my iPod a charger, a tape adapter, an FM broadcaster, a case, a running wheel, and a water bottle, I decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car. These little Belkin numbers are quite nifty. They hold the iPod in a nice position in my cupholder such that I can glance down at it instead of picking it up when I need to review the playlists/switch songs. Overall a nifty product - now even better that it's a little cheaper. 
With a price here on Amazon far better than some of the brick-and-mortar stores, this was an easy purchase to make. My car has unusually large cupholders yet, by simply flipping the base of the TuneDok over, I still managed to get a tight fit with no wobbling for my 3G iPod 
If your iPod has a protective cover (e.g. skin, casing, etc.), then the iPod will not fit in the holder of this kit. Otherwise, you can fit a bare (uncovered) iPod on it well. * The kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes, including adjustable cupholders. * The holder swivels, so you can have your iPod facing straight up or at various angles. * The opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the iPod. * The holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the iPod. It actually holds the iPod well. 
Other reviews mention three cup sizes. More specifically, there are *two* cupholder inserts (small and large), a special bottom attachment (for either of those) to be used in adjustably-sized cupholders, plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability. That makes (at least) six possible combinations, enough to fit any need. And, yes, the holder tilts (and the cupholder insert swivels) to give you the best reading angle. But it doesnt tilt too loosely - you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs; it's even a bit bounce-tolerant, allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt. Lastly, the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down, with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom (now top) of the insert, making a very nice desk stand for when I'm not in the car 
This item is very useful for my car because it doesn't have any unocuppied space near to the cigarette lighter socket. I find it very useful 
This is perfect for my iPod and keeps it totally secure while driving. Great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly. 
I purchased this to use in my LG VX8100 mobile phone. I have used it for MP3's and has been working fine. I initially had some problems with playing the MP3's but found that Verizon had the MP3 setting turned off on the phone. Once I corrected this, the Mini SD has been working fine. Only once I had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the LG not the Mini SD card. No problems since 
I purchased the Mini SD 512 MB flash memory card for my LG 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone. It was easy to install and I could use it right away. Also it came with an adapter for the larger SD, so I can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if I so desired 
It work very good and I have found nothing wrong with it 
This expansion is great, now I have over 120 songs loaded in my phone. Great Media player 
If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more. This device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight. No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time. Looks aside, what does it do? It diffuses your flash's light so you get a softer and more spread-out look to your flash. No more pictures looking like you're shining a spotlight on people. This has a more "natural soft light" look to it. I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room. The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output. You may have to dial up your exposure (meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage). The tradeoff is irritating sometimes, but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos. 
This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed. The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect. PROS: Inexpensive solution for better flash photography. A quality product that works. CONS: Reduces the amount of light cast upon subject (should be expected with these types of products) 
I am probably one of the most musically/sound impared people on the planet. I rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards. I only notice substantial jumps in sound technology. I am very reserved about getting soundcards, as I dont think I ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound. I have gone from a adlib, to a SB, to SB16, to Audigy LS and now to this card. That being said, this is probably the last card I will even pick up or need. The sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards, and is amazing clear. I love the front panel for adding my headphones if I need them. I couldnt be happier with the price I paid or the product itself. Amazing buy. I cant say enough good things. I dont speak geek about the improvements, its like art.. you know what you like, and I love this card 
Everything I have tried to do with the sound card has been easy to do. Great sound, great hardware and good software. 
I have had the X-Fi Platinum for about one month. I upgraded from Soundblaster 5.1, a big upgrade. I have an Asus Motherboard, AMD processor and NVidia video and have not had any problems at all. I got the card to record vinyl to CD. I have about 500 albums. The advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point. I have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine. The recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects. I have put recordings from the records on my mp3 and burned cd's. Better sound than a casette tape and I've just scratched the surface with the software features. I have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it. All I need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features. The card is expensive but worth it, particularly if you have a specific use for it. Take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available, you deserve it. 
First off, not a perfect product far from infact, takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions arn't really clear. I had the Audigy 2 ZS before this sound card and it was a simple install card, install drivers and your good to go; huge improvement over the onboard AC97. This was the first problem, the fact that I had drivers on my system from a previous Sound Blaster card, had to sweep them from my system. my next problem was that the X-Fi drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards, but nothing that updates from there website won't fix (the original drivers must be installed first). Now why would I give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5, the sound is incredible. If the Audigy was step up from the onboard, then the X-Fi is a giant leap. Great for games and movies 
Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issues Cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless. This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for "X-Fi popping/crackling". Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial "hacked" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the "the fastest sound processor" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars. UPDATE 06/12/2006 I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work) 
Hardware was A breeze to install.took about 20 minuets including the bay.Same for the software, no problems.Sound Quality is much improved over my old live card.In battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 2.4/radeon 9700 pro/512.Before I would freeze framing during start in rooms, and during game play in intense situations.Now with the X-Fi I have none of that, and the game runs much smoother overall. Dvd movies sound much improved. Music is also much improved. The only problem Ive had burning expanded mp3's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far. Software interface is also A bit lack luster, but is functional. Card is worth the price, hopefully upgrades will improve interface. 
The last soundblaster I had used was a soundblaster Live a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been relying on onboard sound on Nforce based motherboards. Sound quality was okay, but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs. I decided to upgrade to the X-fi when I started to have sound dropouts while playing Oblivion. Sound quality from the X-Fi is great, especially with headphones. I'm only using the Drive bay I/O panel for the headphone jack, but the price of the Platinum version wasn't much more than just the basic card, so it was money well spent. If I had this set up as a media center PC, the remote control functions would make this an even better deal. A few notes: -I had no problems installing this on an NForce4 based motherboard (Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe) -The I/O drive bay only comes in black. If you still have a tan case you're out of luck -There is a digital SPDIF output available on the back of the card. It's a mini 1/8" jack, and unfortunately no adapter to RCA jack is included 
I've been a Turtle Beach lover because I'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but can't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio. The quality Turtle Beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value. Been using Santa Cruz for years and it runs great. After upgrading CPU/Motherboard and to Z-5500, found the Santa Cruz seems to be lagging, usually about 3-5 glitches (sudden stop of sound) during mp3 playback. It might be my system's problem but anyway upgrade to Montego DDL fixed the problem. Used optical output on Montego DDL and it sounds good enough to me. But Montego DDL has a microphone problem (too low volume) that I can't live with. So I tried X-Fi, only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality. When I put it with Z-5500, I can't believe the quality it delivers. I'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell. Some people complain about no optical output on XtremeMusic and no DDL on the whole X-Fi line. But you really don't need to. Man, the quality from 3 stereo cables at X-Fi is way better than optical output from Montego. This is when I reallized that for audio products, you need listening to compare, instead of looking (the spec) to compare. XtremeMusic should be good for most people but I still bought Platinum version for future proof anyway. In my value, not quality, oriented mind, I still vote for Creative this time. Creative beats Turtle Beach this time. Beats it really hard. Of course, the microphone is fixed too 
All I can say is that they are good sleeves and they are nice to have to protect CD's/DVD's 
I thought this would be a great buy, but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy. Screw that 
Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves! The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. I agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another. They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room. Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases. 
I purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at Circuit City without first looking at the price. I was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax. I purchased the same sleeves at Walmart later the same day for 2.99. Ciruit City has great prices on many things (particularly electronics) but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced. (Same is true of many items at Office Max). I am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves (when purchased from Walmart or a simlar discounter at least) and they get the job done. These sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the open-ended sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in. These sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected 
These are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds. Can't say anything else about them - except this - I noticed when I opened the box they came in 'my' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band. It did not really affect them adversely, but just be aware that yours may come this way also 
The 50 pack are all white, and the window in the front is a useful feature - lets you see what's on there without resorting to opening the envelope. The tab on the back helps keep the disc from falling out - a nice touch 
What's to say? They're paper sleeves for CD's .. 
I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase. However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check. I was astonished. I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this. With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item. If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item. In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks! I cancelled the contract immediately. It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract. I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss. But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice. 
I paid for it and got an e-mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation. Called the 1800#. It's been a month. If it's this hard to get the plan I wonder how it will be if I need to replace my product 
Always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year 
The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home. Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before. I will address the concerns of a few reviews here. 1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound. 2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc. 3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc. 4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black. Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00. 5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle. Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one. But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables. 
I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point 
I was blown away by the sound quality. Good system at a reasonable price. I would recommend this system to all my friend 
I had read some other reviews stating that this Home Theater System makes a buzzing noise. However, I had my doubts so I ordered it anyway and it's great. No buzzing noise on mine at all. I have an apartment and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that I couldn't really use anyway because of noise restrictions. This system is nice and clear and gives me the Home Theater Experience I was looking for. They give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall. Granted the speaker wire isn't all that thick, and has a proprietary male/female connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain. It still sounds great and for under $200 bucks why would you care anyway. 
We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco. It is possible that the newer "D" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode. We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder. When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room. It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful. I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all. Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again 
A very good player at a very reasonable price. 
This is prob. the best item I`ve boughten this year..!!! Totaly awsome system TV, Radio, Surround all in one..! Great buy. 
Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more 
This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers 
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG! Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't). Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 player 
Great battery life, easy to use, all around good. The only minus is the dependency on ITunes 
I bought this as a gift and the person loved it. Great deal for the money 
It's conviently small, but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc, but it has HORRIBLE battery life. I'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and I have to recharge just about every other day. Other than that it's great, just be prepared to have to recharge it ALL the time 
Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use. Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition. Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good. 
Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it 
This iPod was great while I could use it. Then my wife took it and now I only see it when she needs me to recharge it!! I guess it is safe to say that she likes it too!! 
Very happy with the Nano. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly. She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening! Good buy, good product, good amazon! 
This is a TV card I used to replace my aged Lifeview FlyVideo98FM card, so I could watch/record (Trinidad Tobago) games from TV during the world cup in June '06. The TV quality is the best I ever seen from a TV card to date. Give that it is an ATI based card, this is really good stuff. Unfortunately, the software package has let me down. The card came Bundled with Cyberlink PowerCinema. In day to day usage of my computer, I like to have the FM Radio function on. With the old card and 3rd party FM Radio software, there was no issues at all... With this new card, I often can't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering - this on a computer with 1GB RAM and 2 hard drives! I definitely blame the software for this. If the sticking becomes too much then the Radio stops altogether. I'm forced to close and re-open Power Cinema to listen to Radio again. TV is at least stable while doing other stuff, but you can't shrink Powercinema down to a 320x240 window. also there is a 2 second lag between TV and computer watching the same TV station. This never occured with the old card. Intervideo's WinDVR used with this card had no such issue. It's a pity I don't have XP Media Center Edition (XP Pro I have) to compare XP's Media Center software with Cyberlink's.. Somehow I think Media Center will perform better. WinDVR works better too, barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card. PowerCinema works, but it's not very intuitive. The software is written for the novice user with NO advanced options at all. When recording, you do not know exactly what quality you're using outside of "good", "better" or "best". You can't even change the default recording folder! I am sure that this occurs with other brands of Theatre 550 Pro cards, not just MSI's version. As a side note, the remote that comes with the card works well. In conclusion, It's a card worth getting if you can deal with PowerCinema's Issues, or find a better program to use with the card. 
Just finished burning through my first box of these and they are terrific. Not one was a dud. I always trust all Khypermedia Blank disks cause I have never had a problem with them. Don't hesitate to buy yourself a box of these to use for your own project because they will last you forever. Great bargain for a great produc 
I can neither rate nor review this item, because I just realized I have to have two of them to use it. They call it an intercom system, but it is really only half a system. Amazon says there are only two left, so if this seems to be what you are looking for, better buy both. I bought a second one tonight 
I own many Lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance. However, I must add that LEXAR (USA) provides EXCELLENT service. I live in Cape Town, South Africa..... whilst I was formatting one of my LEXAR cards in my Nikon D70, I terminated the formatting halfway (accidentally).... card was damaged..... sent card to LEXAR USA after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days I had a brand new card couried to me by LEXAR..... no questions asked.... This is outstanding service!!! Well done Lexar.....Exceeded expectations 
Fast read/write times are a must for me. I am pleased so far with the card 
awesome product. fast data collection, and holds about 450 photos. i would purchase again 
Lexar Compact Flash Cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals. The "WA" (write-acceleration) feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition. Excellent return on investment! A MUST buy. ~"O 
About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, I've used all of them, had their (file removal) tech help give up. In this day age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself. If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care. How important are your pictures to you? Frederic 
When I bought my camera, the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package. It was very quick--far faster than any of the 512MB cards I had on hand, even those that were of the previous generation of "professional" Lexar cards. My camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card, to the point that I can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly. My only complaint is in the card's reliability. After about a month of medium-load use (about 1000 photos taken), the card ceased functioning while within the camera. Neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers (including the PC Card slot on my laptop with a CF adapter). The image "rescue" software provided by Lexar on the card was of no use, either. Lexar replaced the card, which has worked fine ever since. However, I purchased a second one, which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken. Again, the included ImageRescue software failed to help--it found errors but could not do anything about them--but a commercial image recovery tool I purchased was able to read, then reformat, the card, and it has worked reliably since 
This CF card is so fast that I can run my shutter on my camera non stop until the card is full at a frame rate of 3.5 fps. No lag or slow down. That is amazing. It makes my camera perform better. (Canon Rebel XT 
I purchased the Lexar 1GB 80x Pro CF card for use with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT 8 mega pixel DSLR camera. I also have a SanDisk 1GB CF card which I also use with the DSLR. Of the two cards the Lexar is far and away the fastest in recording reading, I can take multiple shots at the camera's highest resolution (8 Mega Pixels)yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more. There are also no compatibility problems. To be fair to the Sandisk, it's an older model I purchased a few years ago for a MP3 player, however I now use it only as a backup to the Lexar. I plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future 
I just purchased the Canon 20D and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities. Plenty of picture room and I plan to purchase a 2GB prior to my trip to IRELAND. Price wise I did great and the turnaround time was excellent. This card was ranked No 1# in two seperate on line test so I was very sold prior to my purchase. 
If you find that they UPS is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up, there's something wrong with your configuration. The UPS is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer BIOS to restart the computer. This happens only after the UPS has sent a shutdown signal to the computer. You should not power on the computer until the UPS is done with its power up procedure. If you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after AC power is back, you should set your computer BIOS to Power On when AC power is restored. Since, while the computer is off, it doesn't know when the power comes back on, when the UPS cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on 
I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor. Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced. The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total. All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup. Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets. The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service. The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer. Also included is "PowerChute Personal Edition" software. This software replaces the UPS option used under the "Power" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel. PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs. PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar. It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference. In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets. Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the "surge only" outlet row. When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load. It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly . The default method it uses is to place the PC into "hibernation mode", saving the desktop exactly "as is" for future start-up. It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly. If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased. However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks. 
I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005. I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker. Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long. Only load was computer, monitor, and router). At any rate, the shut down was successful. But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so. Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here 
Most people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works. I tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage. I set it to shutdown Windows after 1 minute. Only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it. After power was cut, it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down. Then I restored power to the UPS. AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted. That is unacceptable. A UPS should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it. 
I would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime. Under a 200W load it only lasted 3 minutes while the Back-UPS ES 500 lasted almost 12 minutes. The ES 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime. In my opinion this UPS is only good for very small loads (less than the average computer) 
The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit. This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time. I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers. You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead. You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit) 
I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products. My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC. NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs). I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs. I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless 
I bought 5 of these for the computers in the house. I would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all I need is about 30 seconds of power. I noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on... To my understanding this unit detects (dirty power) and when it detects it, it will then stop accepting ac power. I think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up 
If you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS. They denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage (even though the modem wasn't hurt?) 
Designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes Delorme No support!!!!!!!!! 
I have had this for about 2 years and I travel about 100 days a year by car. I have it hooked up to my laptop, which is on the passanger seat. It has never left me down. In fact I would be lost without it, literly. I tracks where I go anywhere in the US with the existing software. Nothing else to buy !!! It pinpoints where I am at anytime. It's GREAT. If you travel a lot like me via car, and have a laptop, a VERY GOOD, AND LOGICAL PURCHASE 
I have an earlier version of this program and the antenna. It works well in the car with my laptop. I did not have the trouble others had with service. I ordered their latest version of their 3_D Topo map program. It was scheduled to be shipped in late March, 2001. I had an immediate need for the program and called them. I talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to. I asked for a Beta version to use until the new version was released. In less than a week I received the full version (not the Beta version). You can't get better service. Every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily 
fast and reliable..well worth the mone 
Perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera. I used my camera with a SanDisk Pro Duo (the blue one...) and while most times it was fine, when I needed to take pictures in quick succession - it let me down. The Ultra II is noticably faster. You will not regret buying this 
Ultra II gives very good speed to make sure your camera isn't waiting on memory. 
I've had this product for over a year and use it with my Nikon D50. It has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments, example: blowing beach sand, salt water mists, and in high heat and humidity.I bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her Canon SD600. Would buy this brand again 
I used it in Brasil and had it developed. I was very happy with it. It was the very first time I've used a digital camera 
The Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digitial Ultra II (SDSDH-512-901) sent to me was not the item I ordered. I returned the item, unopened 
The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event. I still can't believe it happened. If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this 
This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii. Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD 
It's the fastest and most realiable SD card I ever used. I heard SanDisk has released a newer one that's even faster, but this one is all I need. I bought two 512MB cards to be used with a digital camera (Nikon D50) and never lost anything 
I can only say positive things about this memory card. It does a fabulous job for my 7.1 mega-pixel digital camera. Anyone who is in the market for a fast memory card with lots of storage this is the one I recommend. 
I have several Sandisk products USB Compact Flash and SD, have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days (10MB 15MB cards) Have allways found them to work great and a good value (dollar cost) for the quality. The new ultra II SD card is my second SD, also have a 256MB card (also Sandisk not ultra however) These cards work well and keep on going like the Duracell Bunny! There are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality 
There's a review here where someone takes their COMPUTER and analyzes the performance of the card. Unfortunately, most of the time what matters is how the card works with your CAMERA. A camera generally doesn't move data as fast as a computer, and it has to process it first - so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images (or other files) to your hard drive. If that matters to you, great. For the rest of you, especially camera users, here's the real story: - You need a faster than standard card if you plan to use 30fps 640x480 video. It's also a good idea with high resolution cameras, if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images. - But ... I just bought a different 512MB SD card for $10 after rebate. It's hard to beat that price / performance ratio if you're just storing photographs. Sure, video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year, but other than that, regular speed cards work fine for many uses. Always buy what's right for your needs. And, if the price differences are small, go with the faster card. There are promotions every week on various memory cards, look for one if you have time. Those can make higher speed cards a good value, though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well 
I am still awaiting resolution of a problem I have with these drives. In writing DVDs I get verification errors. This proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure. The drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the IDE bus, but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire 
This is an excellent cd burner. I have purchased so many and all of them are great. I have no complaints and I feel that this product is of the best quality, long lasting and very durable. When I build computers for my customers I always purchase this burner. 
This is my first DVD Burner and the first time I used one of Amazons merchants. I had some concerns about ordering, but everything went very smoothly. Its a good way of purchasing a bargain and I'm very happy with the Sony DVD Burner 
This DVD burner has exceeded my expectations. Additionally the price was right including a rebate offer with my effective price lower than some no-name brands 
also import a cd , money down the drai 
Amazon service was fast. Drive installed easily and is working well after 3 weeks 
The drive arrived at the end of December, was quick to get up and running, and worked fine until yesterday. Then it got the machine equivalent of "lockjaw" and I've been unable to get the tray to release. So, it's a good drive while it operates, but I'll probably make sure I pay for at least a 1-year warranty on my next purchase. As far as my recommendation goes, it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one's drive fails. Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I'd have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage. Computer hardware is never 100% reliable, but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year 
The drive works great. It was a bit difficult to install in my Sony computer as the two faceplates that came with the unit were different than the ones on my computer case--seems like Sony could pay attention to a bit more standardization on such simple things. Service from Amazon was great as expected 
i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true...and sure enough they rejected my upcs (i kept copies) only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional 
Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised! To date, I've been denied twice. The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode! I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted." Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint. The product itself is average. I've used better and worse. That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price 
No free lunch you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product? Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it. I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey. Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership). But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause..... So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business. Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product.. 
This product was perfect. it's a sturdy case that holds my large collection of cd's and dvd's. My other cases were flimsy and wore out fast. This one has a hard outside shell and the inside holds my dvd's nicely. So i have no complaints. and at the price i paid i'd say this was a great deal 
I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T. I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email. I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through! The product itself seems okay. I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet. However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around. A very dishonest company if you ask me. Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate 
I also bought this item. Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC. Rebate denied because UPC was not included. I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it . Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained. To date, have heard nothing from them. I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC. Ji 
I have a collection of over 1500 disks so I have bought many cd/dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that I have purchased. I would avoid this brand. [... 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

definitely recommend this memory card, download time is great . . 
This card is lightning fast. I am using it with my Canon SD700 and works great. Only drawback is that it is slightly expensive, but quality never comes cheap. : 
I recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through Amazon. It did NOT have the notch at the bottom (as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake), so I phoned SanDisk and was informed, based on the serial number, that the card IS authentic. So apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern 
I am happy to have several Sandisk products, and all of them are excellent. 
The SanDisk SDSDH-1024-901 is absoultely worth the extra money if you love to take many pictures without worrying about how many pictures are left for you to take. It is great to use with mini-videos if your camera has this feature 
This memory card is great - great quality and allows my 6 mp camera to take TONS of pictures. I highly recommend this product 
It's a memory card and it works! I have never had a problem with any memory card I have owned including this one. I was told SanDisk was a good brand and so far (5th memory card of theirs I have owned) they have all been reliable 
This card allows me to store 330 pictures at the highest resolution and the lowest compression. If you want less resolution and/or more compression, you can store over 1,000 pictures on this one card. The other big advantage is the very fast transfer times to and from my PC 
Works well, especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use. I have my NES and SNES, both of which have huge AC adapters, plugged into this. It saves tons of space on my power strip. The design is a little clumsy though, so it's only getting 4/5 
This is a very practical way to use the "lost" spot on outlets by the transformers that will use at least 2 spaces with this you can even add 2 in one contruction is good and again is practical 
I was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand, and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic, but when I received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work. Holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely. It does come with book page holders, but I don't really use them 
So I was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages... could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality... So i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11$. AND it works, I used it for two weeks now and I am pretty satisfied. Just like there is one more review on this item... and it says that it is strong and sturdy.. I AGREE. It is a great item for the money. Vitalijus Stony 
It worked much better than expected. The page clips also were very good, but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning/using the item (I put it back on, but fell off a couple more times). I also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well. 
I have tried a dozen holders; this is the best available. Others tip over easily, or they hold only books of a limited size, or they are large, heavy, bulky, and therefore absurdly expensive, etc... This is light, yet sturdy. Hint: I included a few large metal clips, the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place. With the clips, this bookholder works excellently well. In addition, it is also preforated to fit into any three-ring binder. The manufacturer thought of everything on this one. I keep one in the car for when I read in restaurants, another at home, and still a third on my office desk 
Because I'm a free lance writer and reviewer, I often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when I'm direct quoting. I had a book holder from another company, but it was a piece of junk. It wouldn't hold up thicker books and the thin, rounded "holders" at the bottom kept popping off. I even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such. It kept breaking and out of frustration, I went to an office supply store to look for another one. The silver Fellowes Book Holder was all they had. Although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy, I was skeptical. I had him go into the office, get me a thick, hardcover book--and proceeded to take the Book Holder out of the box to test it. (Yes, right there in the store!) I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom. The plastic looks flimsy, but I'm tellin' ya, this baby really does well for holding open thick books! I've been using mine for about a week now and love it. No more headaches when I need to get a quote! YAY 
I read a lot and I was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page. I also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page. Well, I finally decide to try this nice little invention, and let me tell you, it's definitely worth it! It's cheap, but the plastic works fine and does the job well. It stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised. The stand is adjustable. It's great, it makes my life so much easier, and I'm sure glad I bought it 
Sometimes I need to have a few books open at the same time, and still have clear desk space for note taking. I used to keep one in my lap, or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page, or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so I could open another. Not any more! Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway?? This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares? You're not going to loose them unless you've got a silver shag rug that's three inches deep, and it's not a big deal to pop them back in. In truth I have two of these pretty good book things 
This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs. It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders. The page holders are easy to put back in. It saves space on your desk. I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks. It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find 
I wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different PCs. The first, a Dell M50 Precision laptop with 1 GB memory and a 1.8 GHz processor, would capture sound just fine, but only color haze for video. I thought that it was because the M50 has underpowered USB 1.1 ports, so I wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop (also 1GB memory). The best that I got was audio with the sound speeded up (voices sounded like they were on helium) and the same color haze for video. Apparently, it doesn't pay to scrimp in this area. I will promptly return the product and look for something better. From the other reviews, it doesn't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent 
Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought. It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work. Don't buy. 
First of all, here are my computer specs: Pentium 4 2.8 GHz/800 FSB 1 GB DDR2 RAM 2 SATA 7200 RPM hard drives: 80 GB (boot drive), 250 GB (movie drive) Graphics card: ATI Radeon X300 PCIe 128mb Sound card: SoundBlaster Live 24-bit VCR: consumer-grade Sony SLV-N750 My DVD Xpress model number: USBAV-701 Rev. 2 My purpose: To archive old tapes to DVD. Installation of the drivers/software was a quick and painless process. Within minutes, I was already capturing my very first video. This unit works very nicely with retail VHS tapes (I found that it does not respond to Macrovision, though I only tested one tape), home movies, and off-air master tapes (tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts). At first, I captured a short promotional music video at 8 Mb/s in a resolution of 720x480. This produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape. There are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer, but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen. Then I captured a longer home movie, which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a single-layer DVD. My original bitrate of 8 Mb/s was too high, and the higher bitrate wasn't really helping the video quality too much. But if my bitrate is too low, the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a TV. Perform a google search for "videohelp bitrate calculator" and click on the Videohelp bitrate calculator link. I use the calculator to figure out what bitrate I should capture in, according to the total time of all the programs I want to put on DVD. Below 7 Mb/s seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback, but it's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies. After capturing this longer movie, I found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot. Now, whenever I operate it, I point a small fan at it, and this seems to keep it cool and running well. But keeping the unit cool shouldn't be the user's responsibility, so it loses points for temperature. While this device works well if the input video has a stable picture, a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss (being copied several times). I tried capturing one of these tapes, which was of a TV show from 1993, and the DVD Xpress did not handle it very well. The result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory. I am disappointed with this. On the other hand, I have a tape that was recorded from TV in 1988. It is the master copy, so there is no generational loss. DVD Xpress was able to capture it just fine. Not once during any of my captures did audio video get out of sync, so credit where credit's due to ADS Tech for that. After a few days of experimenting with this capture device, I definitely want to keep it. I look forward to finally being able to clean out my VHS closet. My recommendations to other buyers: Understand your source, and you won't be disappointed. There is no way you can make your 10-20 year old tapes look pristine again. But if the video signal is strong and stable, the DVD Xpress should be able to capture it with no problems 
I'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users. Currently I'm running an AMD64 3500+ with 1.5gig ram. The software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time I was recording my first transfer from a VHS player. I'm very comfortable using Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 so that's what I decided to use instead of the bundled software. I've created over 25 DVD's successfully and tonight I decided to give the "Direct to disk" a try. I recorded directly from the video source to the DVD and just like that, I had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my DVD player. I have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version 3.7. I have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes, there were many problems. But after upgrading to something with more power like the AMD64 with 1.5gig ram...well...it was a whole new ballgame. Everything worked as advertised. Just as it should 
if you don't want to spend a ton of money and you want the best quality possible. i am using the ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my DirecTV DVR onto DVD. The quality is outstanding. 2 quick complaints, but really these are only minor things: 1) setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure. the message should have said...."MAKE SURE THE USB CABLE IS PLUGGED IN DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOTHER BOARD"....in other words, in the back of your computer and with a USB port that came with your computer instead of an add on. easy enough fix, but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple. 2) on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video. This has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise, but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100% pure video with no errors. this is a great product....don't look any where else 
The DVD Express 2.0 worked the first time I tried it. It always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have. I agree that Ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit. If you are having trouble getting this little baby going I would suggest a computer class would be apropriate. 
I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well. JU 
This flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months. I used Viking's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response. They offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed, they gave me an RMA to ship it back for a replacement. I had a new one within a week, no hassle, no fees (other than the $1.50 to mail it back to them). I never expected such great customer service. The new drive is working fine, so hopefully that was just a bad batch 
I never even traveled with it. It just stopped working completely making me lose data. NEVER AGAIN I'll buy anything from this company. This drive is a piece of rubbish! 
This USB Flash Memory Drive works exactly as described, and I'm glad I bought it. I didn't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use. My laptop has two USB ports, one directly under the other. This device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second USB device to the other port at the same time. I've given up on the rebate. It's been nearly 5 months, and follow-ups have not helped 
the USB flash frive is super easy to use and and it so small to cary anywhere. I use it for presentations and to load other computers that I'm working with. I would recommend it for not only the great price but the size and value. 
It works sweet it saves my from dragging around my laptop 
nice simple design, easy to use, worked great for me so far 
It works great! I really like it. There is one small problem though. The lid is REALLY hard to take off! I've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little, but not much. There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it. I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion 
When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before. The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home. After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods. In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair! What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable. I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular Memorex product 
I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5. 
I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are. However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks. [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.] I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it. If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away. My main complaint is that I can't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid. I hate to have to pay $7-$8 for stuff I don't need. [My collection is now at over 1800 different DVDs, so I have some experience with cleaning them. 
got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it -100 good thing i could return it 
I had a DVD that was scratched during shipping. One repair kit did nothing to help it. I considered using the Skip Dr., but I never cared for what it did to the disks. My church's Media Center uses the Optifix system, so I decided to try it, too. The scratch was gone, and the DVD plays with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way; some scratches cannot be repaired at all. I just know that it worked great for me 
I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability. It's going back in the morning. This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches. I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc. For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine 
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD. After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable. Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer? 
I'd had quite a few previously viwed DVDs that had scratches. As a result, my DVD player would freeze. This product fixed a couple of DVDs for me. As far as the haze, you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of Optrix afterwards. I stopped buying DVDs new unless I can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin 
This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second. Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second. That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed. For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important. So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures. I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes. In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card. I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings. This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed 
Great value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product. 
This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price! 
This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home. It's a great card at a very good price 
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again 
This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures. When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology. I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos. I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow. Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy. Hope this is some hel 
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500. At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop. After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb. I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update. Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first 
It looks stupid on the picture but wen u get it it looks awesome. That light color is becuz its a little curvy. It looks Awesome and Plays Grea 
Nice package for the beginning guitarist. Everything you need to start playing right out of the box. Guitar is well made and has a nice sound. Only problem was I had to change the strings, as they were tarnished and would not hold their tune. Good value for the mone 
It is a compact flash reader/writer and it does exactly that. So I am happy with it 
I use this little device with my Apple Powerbook to transfer photos taken with Canon digital cameras. Mac OS X recognizes the unit with no additional drivers required, and it works great. Much more convenient than attaching the camera itself to the computer every time 
I bought this becuase downloading pictures from my Digital Rebel XT Camera took forever and a day to complete. Using this drive only took about a minute to download 2 Gigs of pictures! You don't need the CD if you have windows XP. 
Works well with or without software installed. Good for home use and school or traveling. 
i have a card reader slot in my computer, but i purchased this to keep in my camera bag just in case i want to download to a computer that doesn't. it works great, but my only complaint is that it's a little bulky. other than that it's a great card reader 
This SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMate USB 2.0 Reader/Writer is a neat little device. I just pull the Compact Flash card out of my camera, stick it in the ImageMate, plug the USB cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a camera/computer transfer or worry about draining the camera's battery. I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing. I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it. The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable 
I spent $10 on a MediaGrear keychain CF card reader first. That reader is usable, but it is hard to pull my CF card out. I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card. When I plug the reader into my computer, it works immediately, no need to install any driver if you don't need to use that transfer button. 
From appearances and description, this appears to be identical to my SDDR-92 (no A15) except for the shape of the button. This SanDisk is an excellent unit - compact and reasonably slim, with a detachable USB cord. It is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case (unlike my Dazzle which is fine for a desk top, but awkwardly shaped for compact storage). The unit is reliable and fast, and, unlike the 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters, this unit only uses one hard-drive letter. It supports reading, writing, deleting, etc., and works with either USB 2.0 or USB 1.1. If you do not care about the button software, this unit installs plug-n-play, without needing a driver CD (at least on Win 2000 and XP). It simply appears as a removable hard-drive letter in Explorer. I did not install the button software because I am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer. I would rather be in full, manual control of how and when things happen, and where files are put. I think that this is a 5-star unit, but I downgrade my own unit to 4 1/2 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions. In both the instructions, and on a sticky label on the unit (which I still have not been able to fully remove), it proclaims that you MUST install the button software before connecting the unit. I ignored that warning, and the unit worked fine without any installation needed. One of the important requirements in a card reader is portability. Since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer, the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the USB port. The SanDisk SDDR-92 meets this requirement, although it proclaims not to. This is a good choice for a CompactFlash Reader/Writer. 
This controller is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is it wireless, but it corrects my only gripe about the Microsoft S-Controller: I'm 6'3", and have fairly large hands. I love the layout of the S-Controller, but the "arms" are too short for my hands. This leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions, and ends runs in Forza and Call of Duty long before I'm ready to quit. The Logitech controller's arms can't honestly be more than a half-inch longer than the S-Controller's, but it makes a world of difference. I highly recommend this controller not only for it's fantastic wireless performance, but for actually being *more* comfortable than the S-Controller. Another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a memcard/headset slot, and it's a valid complaint. I found the perfect solution in the Logitech Wireless Headset, which can be had here for $20. It works great, and it should be noted that Microsoft still wants $30 for the standard wired headset, which comes with an incredibly-weak clip for the boom mic. All in all, this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the Xbox. Pair it up with the wireless headset from Logitech, and you have a completely wireless control/chat setup for $50 a pop. You honestly can't do better, for any amount of money 
I bought this Controller at Walmat for around 32.00 worth the money no lag whatsoever buy this Controller Le 
The controller is exactly like the Microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the T.V. and not having a cord in the way. The controller works perfect 
Wireless is the way to go! When I put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place... Singular and clean looking this Sweet little controller is, IMO, another triumph by Logitech! Though a little smaller than the S-type, it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance. I got mine used and, once again, put old batteries in it(takes 2)...even four months later, I am just now getting the low battery light flashing... Still Vibrates Still Responds Acurately And the analog sensitivity is better than the wired. Get it, get it... GET IT!! 
I love this controller. I have small hands for an adult, and the pad fits me well. I like the shape better than even the now-standard Controller S shape. I have no problems with delay or drift. I haven't used the D-pad, but the thumbsticks and buttons work great, though I'm not a terribly heavy user. This pad works better than either the Pelican Eclipse or Soul that I own. My Madcatz Lynx is better, but way too big for my hands. I like the feel of the plastic. The only thing I would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top, though I've never had a problem with grip 
I bought this card to go with my Canon 30D and have not been let down. I can get about 500 JPEGs and 300 RAW. SanDisk makes highly constant products. I can set the 30D to take high speed continuos shooting and take 5 RAW pic's and not have the card slow down my camera. Very happy with it 
I received this item for use in a new digital SLR 8.3mgpxl camera. It is fast and stores excellent pictures 
This card is fast and is the right price. It holds tons of high res JPEGS, and around 200 RAW images (on my Rebel XTi). Highly recommended 
Bought this card along with a Rebel XT as a gift for my girlfriend. It's been performing without a hitch so far, though on burst mode, there is transfer lag: in that, the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card, and so after the burst, the pictures are still being written to memory 
I have an EOS Digital Rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade, at first I thought to buy a 1Gb Sandisk memory, but due to the price fall of memory cards I decided to buy the 2Gb card instead. When I inserted the card into the camera, it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in Large/Fine format or 262 in RAW format, that's more than I need even for a one week vacation trip, but if I upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for JPEG+RAW storage. I may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old 128Mb memory card, about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures. I have always trusted in SanDisk products and this card is no exception, quality and performance is as good as I expected 
I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone 
I have been using CF card now for a while in my Nikon d-200. I have been very pleased with its response time. In multi shot mode it keeps up with the camera and I never have to wait. Highly recommended 
Hard to be verbose about a CF card...but it has performed without a hitch in my Rebel XT. Used a 1GB Ultra II when I bought the camera a year ago, picked up the 2GB card before a family vacation in August. Excellent product, no worries 
I have had nothing but good experiences with SanDisk products. This 2GB Ultra II card keeps up with my new Nikon D200 without any problems. It's speed is also a plus when transferring the files to my PC 
I use a laptop since I am always on the go. I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time. I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop. It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great, but it really doesn't do much, if anything at all. I think the idea of the cooling pad is great, but not effective 
Arrived on time and in excellant condition. It works very well, my laptop is much more comfortable to use 
You're money is better spent on another product. It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made. A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged. I had one fan made a scraping noise. The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in. 
I like it. It moves the air out the back pretty fast. Keeps my legs from melting with my HP shooting all the air down. Now I can actually work in longer stretches because I don't have to take time to air out my lap 
really like the chill pad. Keeps my laptop cool!! does its job and i would recomend it to anyone. Lizz 
I have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap, bought the Chill Pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down. It would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable 
This product is cheaply made and noisy. The USB power cable developed a problem after 30 days. Don't get ripped off. Avoid this unreliable product 
This technically works well. I am finding learning to use it difficult. I really wish I had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one!!!!! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger 
I love this Tablet, It's just like working with the real thing with out all that mess, just got to get used to it, I never thought I woulde use the modern art tech but I gave it a chance and I love it. 
I love this tablet! I get the functionality of a tablet computer on my little thin Sony. I almost bought a tablet notebook, but it was so heavy. I have the best of both worlds now! 
What an amazing product for such a small price. It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers. The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics. I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures. It really makes a difference. The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice. I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost. The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools. The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed. Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher 
Before purchasing this Wacom, I did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation. I have no complaints. I can't complain about the size because I knew what 4" X 5" amounted to before I bought it. The clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to, but what doesn't? Like the title says, it's just what I was hoping for 
This is a wonderful item. I upgraded my tablet and it is amazing! I had fast shipment, product was in great shape, and I love it. Thanks! 
If you do a lot of photo retouching, the Graphire4 will give you a lot more control than a mouse. The pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking. The lighter you press, the less dense the mask is. It allows you to "paint" in the correction/effect. The absolute mode (location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you touch/move the pen) of the pen takes a little while to get used to and I still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse. But after a minute or so of using it, it comes pretty easily. I think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet. It's fun to use too 
I was considering purchasing a tablet and Wacom was consistantly recommended. I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line). I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong. Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes. It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop). The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard). Other than that, its an amazing product 
I'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuaI, and have owned several previous models of Wacom tablet. For the life of me, I just couldn't get the Graphire4 working on my Mac at all. The installer crashed (Kernal panic!) my otherwise rock solid Tiger installation. Downloading the latest driver from Wacom's web site was only marginally useful; the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how I adjusted the control panel, and even moderately fast motion caused it to "submarine" from one side of the screen to the other. Wacom's sparse FAQ suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit, and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away. It didn't work, and besides, I have no plans use the tablet from across the room. Phone support was no better: Wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff July 3rd off! Too bad, it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it. Looks like my trusty workhorse Intuos2 tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service, if this is the level to which Wacom's legendary tech support has fallen. 
This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second. Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second. That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed. For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important. So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures. I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes. In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card. I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings. This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed 
Great value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product. 
This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price! 
This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home. It's a great card at a very good price 
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again 
This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures. When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology. I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos. I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow. Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy. Hope this is some hel 
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500. At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop. After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb. I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update. Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first 
This adaptor is great, especially for the price. Installation was as easy as it gets, right out of the box. I had it up and running through a WEP-enabled local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes. It locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection. Both FrontPage and ClieMail ran fine. Speed is maybe 80% of what I get on my laptop running a 333 MHz. Celeron and a PC card 802.11b adaptor. Just be sure your PDA is on the (small) list of supported devices. Negatives: it's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world. I wouldn't leave it in the Clie when not in use and I sure wouldn't want to drop it on the floor. It does chew through the battery, but not any more than the backlight. I did a test with my UX40, with the backlight set at minimum (ie. not off entirely) and using CliePet's UnderClock app to slow it down to 96 MHz. This is a good combination of power saving and usability. Then I got on the net and loaded pages non-stop. Starting from a fully charged battery, it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm. I was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that. I consider that perfectly acceptable. With an EB40 extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it. Overall, a great add-on for a fraction of the price of a UX50 
I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless: - It comes with a web browser that doesn't work. - Even if the browser DID work, it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version. - The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible). - The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail, software that comes with Internet-enabled CLIE devices... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card. These programs are not available separately. - The card wouldn't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors', even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either, no additional configuration required. - While attempting to connect, the card would often stop responding, and then lock up the handheld. Bottom line: if you want a web-enabled PDA, buy a web-enabled PDA. Don't buy this 
I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though. #1 There is no case for the card. #2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1 #3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it. Otherwise its a great little expansion card 
This item gives wireless capability to Clie users, and it's the only option if you dont have a wireless integrated handheld. It is compatible with the models PEG-TJ27, PEG-TJ35, PEG-TJ25, PEG-UX40, PEG-TG50, PEG-NZ90, PEG-NX70V, and PEG-NX60. The WLAN card works great and I recomend this for every Clie user who wants to go wireless (... 
I bought this for my digital camera because my other batteries didn't last very long. These work great and last for a long time. 
It tells you what it is doing. Some communication is better than none 
Voltage input can be either 110VAC or 220VAC, which is very important in other countries. Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are better than old fashioned rechargables because they do not necessarily have to be totally discharged before recharging. Charging units are compact and light 
gives me charged cells in quick time..added advantage is the world wide voltage capabilit 
I bought this to replace original Canon batteries that came with my Canon A280. This is really good and I am happy with battery life, charge time etc. The best features I like: - Short charge time - Compact cas 
We recharge batteries all the time with this charger and it does an excellent job, all the time 
This WorldWide charger is the best that i have ever used. I use this mainly for my camera. Nowadays I don't even bother to charge frequently. But a small drawback would be then can have provide AAA batteries as well in there pack so that we do not buy them individually. 
Great batteries for cameras. They charge quickly, and it's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time "just in case" 
The charger arrived with in 2 days., [ Amazon PRIME ]. I used this battery for my Canon A 530 and it works like a charm.

I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone. I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

We had purchased a DVD recorder and within 5/6 months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor, I contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last 5/6 months. We bought this product and from the time of cleaning it has worked perfectly. I will recommend anyone having problems with their DVD player/recorder to try this first before sending the unit to the repair shop as I was about to do. 
I've not found anything from Memorex that works right, try Maxell products from Amazon, you can't find better products and the best customer service on the net. 
Can't see spending tons of money to clean a product that has been out in the market for lots of years. It works just fine, and cleans just as stated. 
I got it at very reasonable price approx 4 bucks sells for 9-10 at retail stores. Works great and nothing can beat this deal!!!! only if its free...!! ha!ha 
It is inexpensive and works. My daughters CD maching kept getting error messages. Popped this in, cleand the lens and no longer get error messages. What more can you say 
I have a Sony DVD player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time, and would still be good today if functioning. Recently however, it was seriously malfunctioning. I would put a DVD in, and it would keep spinning, but then not recognize it at all. It would recognize and play CDs, but they would skip constantly. I decided to give this a chance for $5 to see if I could recover my player. I ran it once and it seemed to skip less, but would still not recognize DVDs. I thought , maybe if I put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work. Voila!!! I couldn't believe it, DVDs were recognized and played again. So give it a try, maybe run it a few times!!! 
Hi, Hey, don't run to the repair shop just yet and don't kick that DVP/DVR to the curb too soon.......help is on the way!!! My DVR was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until I fed it this Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner. WOW, it worked like magic!!! It's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day I purchased it. If you own a CDP/DVP/DVR a Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop......it certainly did in my case!!! Just my two cents. -paul 
I like the use of this product. i think it did solve solve the problem my computer cd/dvd drive was facing which was slow reading the cds... with the low price its a must for every computer owner to use this 
i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much). but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before. ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer 
I don't have much room on my desk, but this copy holder fits perfectly and is still sturdy enough to hold up most texts. 
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks. If you put a textbook on it and turn the page, it collapses and or tears the page. I wouldn't even use this for a notebook. 
This is working out real well as a notebook stand for me. You can't beat the pric 
This product is [retty good, but don't even try putting a bood on it, the holder will tip over and it doesn't clip the pages of a book very well. But for papers it's good and it's adjustable, which is convient. It did hold my notebook very well, but for books it sucks. 
This holder keeps papers upright and in position, but it doesn't handle books particularly well, as the clip cannot grip surfaces as thick as most books and the base isn't as wide as most books when they're opened. I have this AND a book stand so I keep myself covered on both ends 
I purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows I couldn't wait to get my hands on one.Why wouldn't I? it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. At first it looked like a really cool product, and is, if your system is a Mac. Logitech has done a great job of selling the Nulooq to Windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on. There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product. I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech. What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users. So if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you....and I know where there is one for sale!!! 
I love my tooldial and its' software. My only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively. I frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little. Overall great product and I expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs. Works very well in tandem with a WACOM tablet 
Been waiting for the Windows version since I saw the product at PMA on Mac earlier this year. Used the Windows version from the very moment it was available. I touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great. Tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end. Adjusting brush size is the best. Bracket keys never cut it for me. I think the product does more, but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver. If you do touch up work in Photoshop all day long, this is a must have 
The NuLOOQ is an inexpensive and really fun way to fly through images in Photoshop when cloning out specks or needing to move throughout an image with lightning speed. The Pan/Zoom function is tremendous! It's a programmable tool where you can add photoshop tools and actions to the Tooldial for instant access at the mouse location, rather than moving to the menu bar all the time. This is a great time saver because you can program in redundant tasks to appear on the tool dial to be clicked in a moments notice. Changing brush size is as simple as turning the tool tuner to the appropriate brush size, in real time. I highly recommend it to speed and simplify one's workflow 
I bought a NuLOOQ when it first came out for the Mac. I've been an Illustrator Visualization Artist for 17 years now. I have an iMac at home and a PC at my full-time job. It takes a little while to break some old habbits, but once you do, and get used to the NuLOOQ device, you'll never go back! I love this smart toy! I got so hooked on it, I recently purchased one for my PC here at work. If there is anyone out there that thinks it's just for the Mac your wrong! The PC version is just as good! It's become part of my left hand and I still use my Wacom tablet all the time also! To me, this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer; cross platform. Bravo to Logitech for making another great product! Get one...I'll guarantee you'll get hooked on it 
Logitech scored a big plus with this item. The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly. The first review is really unfair. Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous. Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did. Good job on this one. I recommend it highly 
I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today. One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found 1) Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response. Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand. Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead. 2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod, but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad. 3) The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly heavy pressure to operate, at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week.... There may be a device out there that will someday "revolutionize my workflow", but this isnt it, Back it goes... 
I am a photographer whop purchased this for use in Photoshop. It exceeded my expectations, and continues to amaze me daily. I now use it for everything from my Safari Browser and iTunes to games. It is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications! It is by far the most innovative product I have ever used...and the Tooldial software it comes with is AWSOME! 
I bought the NuLOOQ product a few weeks ago with little expectation and actually with some doubts it'd do anything for me, as I'm a keyboard junkie. The product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot. But what a surprise. Just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price. The pop-up menu thing is cool. I don't use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place. I guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around, but I don't seem to use that as much. I still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around. Hey, I was skeptical about the product like anyone else, but found myself a rare surprise. Good job Logitech 
I've had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my XP machine and am now using it with my Apple Mac Mini. Works great with both Windows and Mac OS X, with no hassles. The removable stand is a nice touch, as you can pack the reader into a laptop bag or lay it horizontally if you prefer. Highly recommended 
I bought this card reader in Feb. 2004 to use with SD cards. Since then I have moved over to CF cards (Sandisk Ultra II's both 1 and 4 gig) and it has worked great every time 
I have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera. 
I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card. I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins. To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't. I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing. For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process. Not a quality reader. Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in. Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it. Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick. Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader 
This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably. The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine. This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green). This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it 
The Reader worked as advertised. I'm very pleased with the purchase.. 
The Sandisk reader is impossible to misuse. It loads quickly and it's compact shape offers most options for memory. It can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet. I would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn't move around on my desk so I'm giving it only 4 stars. If I had to replace this reader, I would buy another SanDisk 
No problem reading and burning on NEC 2500A. The media code is MCC which is highly rated in most media guides online (albeit not the best). I also burn DVDs as slow as I can unless I am in a hurry, less chance for errors that way 
I am very happy with these. They are fast and with very good qualit 
At least for my Sony DVD burner in my Powermac. Completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot 
Some of the worst DVDs that I have purchased. I wouldn't waste my money on any more of these POS discs. I wish I could return them to amazon, but for what I paid (it was pretty cheap), its not worth the effort. 
I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media. I always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case. It takes longer, but I get good results. I am rarely in a hurry to burn a DVD. I would buy these again. ** Updated on 7/3/2005 ** I have bought a new computer recently and I have been burning these DVDs with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever. Very happy with this product 
If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star. Media code: MCC 01RG20. 2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008 
They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up). These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used. The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK. I am going to return these package to Amazon. 
I have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters, They are burning at 8X in my NEC 2500A burner. That is pretty considering that it is advertised at 4X. Hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years 
No problems with this SanDisk. I can take about 300 pictures from my Nikon camera. Quality is perfect. 
shipping was outrageous, thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a F'n postage stamp, but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than I did for the item, could have bought it at walmart for less this way. Buyer beware, I got took 
Good price. What else can one say about a Secure Digital Card 
Excellent service from Amazon, Best quality in lowest price, I am really very happywith Amazo 
This is an excellent, reliable product. I bought 2 because of the outstanding sale price 
I love this 512mb SD card, its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a 1gig SD card too. works great with my GPS unit 
This card works great and is significantly less expensive than it is at local retail stores. As a matter of fact, I just ordered another one yesterday 
This sandisk digital card has been very useful and worked perfectly fine. Thank you 
The card performs exactly the way that I expected it to, and I have had zero issues with speed downloading images from the care to my PC 
You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store 
I was impressed with the quality of pictures I got with this memory card. I have a very inexpensive camera but the pictures are terrific 
This is a high quality product, and can be used in several digital cameras with great results 
I gave this to my nephew for his birthday--hold lots of pics and videos (at least 250 pics). I wouldn't say it ever cost as much as the "marked down" price, but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores--about $15 cheaper. I am pleased. 
Bought this item over a year ago and have had no problems with this card. It holds lots of pictures (depending on your settings) and hasn't caused me any problems. Well worth the money! I take lots of pictures of my son and anytime we go anywhere new, so it gets used a lot 
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries. The Kingston 128MB Secure Digital Memory Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera. I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs 
SD cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems. I don't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at Disney took place. I had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera (which I have since trashed for this incident and bought a new Nikon) but anyway I had over 300+ pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of DisneyWorld. I cried. So as a suggestion...clean off your Memory cards after each event and don't go for the 512MB or the 1GB cards unless you are putting video on it or etc. Now I am a happy person once again since my hubby's going to take me back to DW to replenish those missing pics! =) 
Bought this card for my XDA I PDA. Worked fine right out of the box. However, this only showed up as 118mb card !!! not sure if this is the SD card itself or the PDA causing the loss of some 10mb worth of space. Also it is slow to write to the card, but quite fast when reading from the card. 
The card works great in my camera. What more is there to say 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
I was attracted to this remote by the web programming interface: I have friends who have to hold their remotes head-to-head and program each command one at a time, and then build the macros. By contrast, I was able to configure my system even before I bought the remote (there is a trial SW available on the Harmony web page which took me 15 minutes to set up once I had a list of my devices): once I had the Harmony box opened, it took me about 4 minutes to start using it to control my TV, DVD etc since the web site remembers your setup. A couple of commands did not work right away, so I ended up having to add them in individually ("Exit" and "OK" were not correct in the Harmony database for my Panasonic TV). I also noticed that the cradle does not contact well, but it's easy to see when contact is made, and it doesn't take much to adjust it. Besides, the remote doesn't need charging all the time - only once a week for moderate usage. Even my gadget-phobe wife loves this remote - just having one remote is a joy for her. And trust me, web-programming of the remote is the way to go. I'm only pissed that there is now a $30 rebate, like the week after I bought mine 
Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue 
Easy to use, and fairly easy to set up. However, as stated in most previous reviews I read, initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use. Wish that macro creation was more detailed; for example, more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a DVD, including ejecting and closing the DVD tray. Pleased with purchase 
Best remote product I ever purchased. I have the older version of the Harmony and This newer version is 10 times better. Lipo battery last for ever and you dont need to worry about it going dead because you charge it to much 
This was a breeze to set up. Just install the software on you computer, enter the model numbers of your components. For those few items that aren't in the list, the 880 can learn from an old remote. As a very nice bonus, if you don't have the old remote, the software will try to pick a device (example : you have an RCA tv Model XYZ , if model XYZ isn't in the list, it might suggest ZxY) , and that suggestion should work. I liked how I could create a list of favorite channels, and how I could upload icons for those channels to the remote. So that it shows the icon instead of the number. Or better yet. Open the icon in paint and in the icon put the number (the channel number right in/on the icon). It looks good and works great! I love how the database for the IR codes for all the different devices can be added to by the users of the remote. I understand that no company could ever hope to have ALL of the IR codes for ALL devices ever made. To think that a company could do that would be insane. Logitech realized there is power in numbers. Let the end users help to improve things. It also allows you to leave any components on permanently, for example my TIVO box. I don't want that to turn off. It can be turned off, and as a default the Harmony 880 will turn it off (to save power). I prefer it on. And making that change was pretty simple, you just go into the preferences for the TIVO (in the harmony software), and tell it "Always leave this device on". Now when you hit the off button on the harmony remote, everything else turns off and the harmony 880 leave the TIVO on. My only complaints are these items: The buttons to the left and right of the screen are a little tough to push. I personally think they should have been a little easier to activate. Also I would have liked to have had the pause button a little more centered and more separated from the other buttons. That way it would have been easier to pause a tv show/dvd/vcr tape. And last but not least the Media and Device buttons should have been separated more from the left and right arrows that are just above those buttons. It's a little tough to hit them without thinking about what you are doing. Given to have made the improvements I have just said would require adding a little width to the remote, but the trade off would have been for the better. All in all I suggest the remote for anyone who has a number of components for their home theater. It works wonders. It might just be that I am a little to picky on my technology. 
I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database. Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package. In any event the process was hassle free and I now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great. (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.) My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off. However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again. The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base. Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880. 
If you have basic PC skills this remote is for you. With its USB connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it. The small LCD screen is very easy to set up and you. If your to lazy to customize your remote(me), it also has a learning port. The learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one. My favorite feature is turning everything on. The button "Play DVD" turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv, additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres tv/video. The only problem that I have with this remote is the recharge base. It sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed on/off and gives off a beep. All in all this is probably the best remote ive ever had 
This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months. About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono. Had to send it in for repairs. After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred. Had to send it for repairs again. A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease. In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged. I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night. So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely. When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message . Resetting does not work. The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195. Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit. I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again 
I had an iPod for about a year, and had a lot of problems with it, having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired. After the third time, I sold it to a friend and invested in the iAudio instead. This is a great product, as it can record sound, play movies, radio, and play tons of file formats. I highly reccomend this product, especially over the iPod...they are crap compared to this. The only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts m4p files (songs from iTunes if you purchase music from them) as the iAudio can't read m4a or m4p. It's easy enough to get a converter, just might cost you a little more money. Outstanding use of my money though....thumbs up 
I bought this player in December 2005,since then , this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well. I have no complaint about it, because I'm extremely dependent of this player, so that means that i use it, around 5 hours in my days off,and 2 hours in a regular day.Another example of how durable this player is, because I like to exercise(running) with the music as my main powerï¿½ï¿½, therefore with the really hard to find function(anti-shock) in portable hard drives, the iaudio x5 is one the most functional PMP on the market. About the sound is just incredible clear with the right earphones.the unique complaint is about the non-sync with WMP,so I'm still waiting the right firmware... As a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products. 
I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works 
When I started looking for an mp3 player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level. The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects: -Superb sound quality, especially from something that weighs under 8 oz. (I am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable) -Rugged all metal construction and overall great feel -Simple design and intuitive joystick/buttons (I found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes; converts from the iPod may take some getting used to) -A plethera of options: mach3 bass, surround sound, pan, wallpaper, 5 band equalizer, fm radio, voice recorder, surround sound and MP enhance -The ability to play video -A 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time -Very powerful, I normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it -Priced about the same as equal or lesser mp3 players -Extremely easy program to use for transferring ANY type of file to the iAudio. It is a drag and drop system; it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music. -Everything you need is included in the box - earphones, usb 2.0 transfer cable, another cable, a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player, charger and jetshell software -Great storage space (20 GB) which can be used to store much more than mp3s There are some negative attributes to the iAudio X5 however: -The most glaring problem I had was with the in-ear headphones; they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable. They also have an assymetrical length cord. I consider myself to have average size ear canals so I imagine this is a major problem for other users. I suggest Cowon completely redesigns these. -Because the brand is widely unknown, the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews. -No place online to buy mp3s particulary for this player (however I read somewhere that there would soon be one just like iTunes.) This being my first mp3 player I am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price, because I would rather pay more for the quality. The iAudio X5 is an all around outstanding media player and I believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out. If I were to rate everything that came in the box I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones. Other than that this mp3 player is close to perfect. 
I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat. This is a quibble, however, that one can live with. Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good. 
I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail. Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research. If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want. iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully). This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for. If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked. Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal. Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40. I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing. I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player). I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool. Absolutley buy this unit. I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it 
I am not going to rehash what the other comments have said. Most that mention pros and cons are accurate. Here is my addition. Joystick is not as good as the Ipod. On the other hand, the Ipod was designed by Apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a PC. I have not even installed any software to use my iAudio! I use it as a hard drive, Mp3 player, and sometimes I record radio shows to listen to later. I got the 30gb for extra storage. The iAudio seems to be quality made and doesn't scratch as bad as my son's iPod. I would buy this product if I had to do it all over again! 
This is the second G15 keyboard I've purchased, not because the first one broke, because it's such a great keyboard. Now I keep one at home, and take one with me when I go LANning. The only issue with the keyboard is the LCD is pretty useless is fast paced FPS games, otherwise it's good for keeping the clock up so one doesn't lose track of the time 
I bought this a few months back, and I use it mostly for playing WoW. PROS: Very high quality product, strong enough to endure long keyboard-smashing combat sessions. The LCD is very useful if [like me] you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game, because it allows me to control iTunes whithout alt-tabbing out of the full-screen game. Macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites, and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your in-game action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard (I use flexbar with WoW). CONS: The software needs a bit of improvement: If I put my computer to hybernate, the software seems to hang when I bring it back up, and I can't use the macro keys, so I have to reboot or kill the software's process and restart it manually. The interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability (it forces me to use the mouse a lot, and i like being able to use the keyboard). Even though the LCD offers other posibilities [like displaying available ammo], I don't use most of them, because I can get most of these values from my game's UI and I dont have to look away from the monitor to do so. Overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming. Wouldn't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming 
Overall, this keyboard is great. Here are what I like about it: 1. I can fly on this key due to it's relatively soft keys (I think there are softer keyboards, i.e. less resistance when pressing down. God, I miss my SPAR station keyboard, but can't use it with a PC :( ) 2. LCD screen has huge growth potential for other info display. 3. lighted keys (this can be a bad thing too). 4. Programmable keys, lots of them! (can be a headache to remember them too) The flaws: 1. The lighted keys uses a bright blue color, even at the dimmest setting it's still not good. Here's some physics for the designers: The human eye doesn't sense blue well in the dark, and thus the pupil stays wide open, and the blue lights can be seen as a bad glare. Same effect of having one of those expensive HID xeon headlights beaming at you. So why is this a problem on a keyboard? well, you would most likely use it in the dark with the key lights on. However, your peripheral vision will have this blinding glare, it could make some people dizzy or have some optical illusion that's not going to sit well with your eye's scan rate. Suggestion for the designer: use other less intrusive color for the LED, possibly red, orange, green. Hell, make them selectable! Blue would not be my first choice. 2. The USB plugs on this keyboard doesn't support my USB 2.0 flash drive, BAD!!!! If you are going to provide an USB port, do it right! 3. The black soft rubber surface on the edge and LCD back cover is a dust magnet. They provide some good traction when you grab them, but they also grab dust like nothing else, so you'll endup with an impossible to clean black surface. Lesson learned, don't eat snacks near the keyboard, or your keyboard will end up with lots of nice snacks for the dog to lick :D Ok, duck tape would fix that, but... I'm lazy! Other than that, it's a solid keyboard 
I've had the Logitech G15 for several months now and it has many features which I use regularly. The paint doesn't seem to wear off even if I rub or scratch at the keys. Installation was somewhat time consuming because the keyboard has drivers for each part rather than one driver for the entire thing. Pros- Lights look great Screen is easily readable Third party LCD apps are highly customizable I can use chat on Trillian and access my buddy list with the screen. (Keystrokes go directly to the screen when you hit the button for reply, then I can send it by hitting enter) I can view a winamp visualization and song title, view my playlist, change various volume controls and use standard playback functions I can view network activity Macros are easy to program The key feel is awesome compared to my old keyboard. They have a nice solid click to them, but the pressure necessary and the keystroke length are both small.  Cons- Included LCD apps are terrible and useless to me Long setup More G-Keys than you'll ever use Minimal game support LCD apps take up valuable RAM (although not much) Keyboard profiler takes up RAM and must run to maintain full functionality Invisible lettering when the lights are off Light brightness levels are pointless. The options are: Off-can't see it! 1-Visable but dim. 2-Slightly more visible but still dim. USB ports are USB 1.1 "Gaming mode switch"... I never hit the windows key while gaming even though I usually use ctrl and alt frequently. I think you'd really have to be fumbling with the keys to need that feature The wrist rest is flimsy The default LCD setting is to cycle through the APPS (which I hate) and if I don't shut down properly, the LCD profiler resets all its settings to default. The included POP3 checker doesn't have SSL, you need to get some ridiculous add on which sucks up more resources. The mail checker APP+ the SSL thing ends up being a little too resource heavy for me to appreciate. In other words, its a big pain to get Gmail working with the included checker. If you play a lot of World of Warcraft or really like to tweak your settings and streamline your interface, you might enjoy having all the macros. The screen is more useful for non-gaming purposes, so don't buy it with intent to improve your HL2 experience (since the LCD doesn't display anything for HL2 anyway). There are many 3rd party LCD apps out there and you can probably find one that will make you love the screen. Be warned, unless you use the 3rd party apps, you probably will be disappointed with the LCD's functionality. Bottom line- Recently the priced spiked up for these keyboards, I wouldn't pay the new higher price for one. This isn't the kind of item I would say that I can't live without. Its mainly a luxury, and unless you're a serious computer geek (like myself), you probably won't even know how to utilize the more advanced features. The hardware is solid and powerful if you know how to use it. The included software cd ended up in my trash can. 
Just like others have stated. The paint comes off the keys after a few months of use. You would think logitech would have made a better product. 
Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws. I called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices. All-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger 
This fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical ho-hum keyboard. The LCD screen is a nice feature (toy) but I find myself rarely using it as most apps and games don't support it. The two USB ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside USB on their towers. It is worth buying for anyone in that situation. The blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but doesn't help much in a truly dark room. The macro keys are plentiful and easy to use. All-in-all well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard, anyone needing easy access to USB ports and for anyone needing macro keys. People may also want to give the new Vista keyboard from Microsoft a look 
I'm very happy with the set. Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable. I was thrilled when I made this discovery. Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness. The picture quality for analog channels is only so-so. I really wish the remote was illuminated. Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised. Other than these negatives, I'm very happy 
We bought this TV 3 months ago and don't regret it one bit. It was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition. We do not have satellite or cable (only reg. antenna) and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the "digital" signals. Again, we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to HD 
I searched far and wide and compared many tv's. It came down to the Panasonic Plasma TV vs. the Sony KDFE42A10. I went with the Sony due to price; but I'm glad I did. I can't see putting [...]in a TV. I am really pleased with the Sony; particularly the price I paid. It was so much cheaper here at Amazon.com than at the big box retail stores 
I purchased this television at a bricks-and-mortar store, on sale, for less money than the 32" LCD screen that I was considering. I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV. For comparison, I am moving from a 26" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great. My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault. I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200. My last "pro" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet. I can scoot this TV on my stand without scratching the wood surface, and when trying to center a TV which is nearly 40" wide across the front, that's a good thing 
My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it. I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well). Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves. My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me. Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite. My first impression had me rather worried. I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out. I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others. In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them. I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time. The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great. The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen. The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video. I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs. The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking. Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual. Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon. Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level. I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation. I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off. Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that. I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon. I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away. But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery. I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer. Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place. All in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner 
I got mine locally for $1100 dollars. The going rate was 1399-1599. I saw it at a competitor for $1198. So I went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another $100 off the price for HDTV installation. What a picture. I started to get turned off by sony because I had 2 32 inch CRT's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners. But I remained loyal and I'm glad I did. I was iniitally wanting a DLP by Samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away. I didn't go for the $500 dollar service contract because that's half of the price of the television. I'll take my chances on this one. Hopefully bulbs will come down too. You'll love the picture with or without HDTV. I love all the features and they're pretty intuitive. There probably won't be too many left. I think they're phasing the model out. Not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it. Sorry about the other bad reviews here 
I bought this TV in March of this year (2006) and it has worked perfectly until the Sony Techs came out and "updated" my firmware. I was not having any problems with the TV but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty. As soon as the tech left and I turned on the TV, the fan is running on "high" and is loud. This did not happen until the software was updated. I went into the functions and tried to use the High Alt function to turn the fan to low (off) but that would work. The good news is I bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed, or replaced......... Word of caution, you may consider not updating the firmware if the TV is working, and buy the extended warranty. I paid $300 for 4 years and figure I'll get at least one $250 bulb out of the deal (yes, it is covered). Otherwise, the TV is perfect 
I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran 
Well, I can't give an honest review of this product because I haven't yet received it. I ordered it on June 15, and it was promised, by Amazon direct, not another seller via Amazon, between June 21 and June 23. So I'm sitting here on July 15 with no TV....... It really isn't Amazon's fault, it's the shipper, Eagle. But whatever, I'm less than satisfied with this Amazon.com transaction. I have seen the TV in stores and it looks good though.................. 
Brilliant images. Highest quality. You simply cannot beat this system for the price. Also, this particular projection TV handles the non-HDTV channels very well - not all HDTV models do this. The fact is that most channels are not available in HDTV yet, so it's nice to have a high quality TV that can deliver non-HDTV channels to you in a high quality rendering. This TV does that very well. Yes it's nothing like HDTV, but all the same they do a fine job with this model 
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution 
We have the original Itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in. The originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station. After reading the instructions I plugged the new Itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals. Not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away. That is better than I expected after reading all the feedback. I'm not sure what everyones problem is. It's not a radio tower, it's a transmitter the size of your finger. I get the feeling that some people think it should power the City block. 
I was a little tentative to order the iTrip LCD because of some of the bad reviews I read. It seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item. Buyers either love it or hate it.  I was leaving for a trip and hoped the iTrip would arrive so I could use it on my drive. As luck would have it, it was in my mailbox the day before I left. I unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it.  I plugged it into my 20GB iPod photo and right off the bat thought I had trouble. It wouldn't power up, I tried plugging and unplugging, cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort, read the instructions. After plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on. This immediately explains why so many poeple complain of DOAs right out of the box.  I set the frequency to the lowest available on the FM band and presto!!! instant music. I don't live in an extremely populated area so I can't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet. Many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this. It doesn't matter how great the quality of the song is on your iPod, you are playing it over FM radio so it will never sound better than FM radio. I inherited my father's '91 Accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones AM/FM radio with a tone control(bass AND treble all rolled into one handy knob!!!) and cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers in the front doors. When I drive I like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music. The sound quality was exactly what I expected, no better and no worse. I also tested it in my wife's '01 Focus. It has a nice factory 6 speaker CD system and the sound from the iPod was just fine. The bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all. I am completely satisfied with the product. One strange thing that I noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the iTrip, the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone. If you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road. Unless there was a defective batch sent out, I don't know where all of the complaints come from. I got mine for $15 from a private seller on Amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money. Don't hesitate to buy one, it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is. If you keep these things in mind, you won't be disappointed 
it was not what i was expecting... but still ok... probably 96kbps... quality... still all right for the price... but if u want something with 320kbps quality... do not buy this product.. 
i was using the tape player for my ipod. but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter. i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency. i was very very disappointed. it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease. i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear. so i blame the transmitter. i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it. i'm glad target took it back. 
Some people seem to have had issues but I loved mine. I live in the Boston area and the iTrip always worked fine in the 88.3-88.5 range. Not fantastic sound but more than adequate. The portability is a huge plus as well - I used it for playing my iPod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling, radios at friends' houses, on and on. The iTrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable. I have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently. For the price and the convenience you can't beat this thing. The only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of iPods 
I purchased 1 of the old model when I bought my ipod. As hard as I tried I was unable to switch stations on it. "Okay" I thought, "I must have got the one bad one..." So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the "radio stations" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are "just not tuned in right" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the "station fuzz" goes away. Only a fool walks on thin ice twice - and I've done it 3 times now...Never again! Don't follow in my footsteps! Please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage 
So, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an "ipod to car" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio. 
It's goo 
I've used this to burn about 3 CDs and my husband has done a couple as well. We haven't had any problem so far 
I have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an "ABC" book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use 
It was a little complicated to install (but I'm not very technical) but it is very easy to use - I have been happy with it 
I bought this about 7 months ago and never had a problem with it. It take 7 minutes to burn an 80 minute cd. The program reminds you to close any other open programs before burning a disc, very easy to use. I brun cd's every single day. It is my baby!! 
It is an excellent product, easy to install, really powerful, the only minus is the burner software, if you have or you can purchase Nero or CDRWin then you can obtain the maximum performance from this unit 
I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned. Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market. The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it. Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on. On other occasions it completely locks up. The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG". The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes. There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner. I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system. First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load. To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk. If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over. Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be. On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful. I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception. Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review. Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great. It's average. Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass. The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it. But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now. I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon. 
I ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here. BIG MISTAKE. Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded "UNPLUG/PROTECT" screen came up. Now it won't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it's not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!! On top of that, even out of the box, NONE of the video inputs worked. Audio was fine, but video was dead as a doornail, right from the start. And even on top of the fact that this machine CAME broken... it sucks even when it works right! The DVDs take forever to load, and it comes with HDMI out, but NO HDMI IN! So if you're an HDMI user, I hope you have multiple HDMI inputs on your television... one for your cable box, one for this crappy system. This is a piece of junk. For the love of god, don't waste your money 
I bought this "dream system" to compliment my Samsung HL-R5087W 50" HDTV DLP television. If looks could kill these two products together win hands down. Overall I am pleased with the system for the amount of money I invested for it. Sound is decent. I feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with Monster Cables. As like many others thoughts I was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and "wireless" seemed to be the answer. Problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a WIRE. So if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because Sony has figured out how to eliminate point A to point B but point B to point C remain dreamless 
This product is awesome....of course, it's a Sony :) What else can I say 
I started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment. A wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my TV. After searching for a while, there were only a couple options available: the Sony DAV-FX100W, a system by Panasonic that had an optional wireless option, and a wireless receiver kit made by Kenwood. After looking at reviews of all of the different options, the Sony DAV-FX100W appeared like the best choice. I'm very happy with that decision. DVDs look great on my HDTV with the 1080i upscaling feature. Be forewarned, if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive HDMI cable and your TV will need to be support it. I bought a 3ft Belkin cable (instead of Monster) and it was still over $100. DVDs also sound terrific; the surround is impressive for a wireless solution. Like any stereo, it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker, and I pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel. The subwoofer, as others have stated, is pretty powerful for a passive speaker. There could be more depth to the sound, however, it is an out of the box solution and I think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it's default sound level. Others have complained that CDs don't sound good; I disagree. I've played several CDs and I think they sound great. I also input my iPod through the Video1 audio inputs, and that sounds pretty great too. Again, like any receive, you'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking. Overall, I'm very happy with this system 
I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one. Some Dream System. The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well. After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas. I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!! And i haven't even watched a movie ye 
I purchased the Sony DAV-FX100W system over the internet. It surprisingly arrived in only a few days. Assembly and wiring instructions were done well. It looks good and matches well with my Sony HDTV. The sound quality is just fine for movies and TV programs but fair at best for listening to music on CD's or from the FM tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo. The base is not tight and kind of whoompy, although there is plenty of it. I actually had to decrease it by 3 db. The many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the "sport" which does sound like being in a stadium. Most of the time it is best in "auto" performing in the method the audio was recorded. The IR transmitter/receiver works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as AC power for the amp, a wire from the IR receive to the amp, and wires from the amp to both rear speakers. Not as clean as one might imagine from the product description. As mentioned in previous reviews, the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack. A 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with DVD's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple CD's to listen for music. I certainly would prefer my stereo for that! Over all I am satisfied with it and recommend it. It performs well for what it was intended, to reproduce sound from movies and TV. Again it is a good looking system. 
The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating. The compact flash card slot still works, though. I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it didn't work with their 4GB SD card. It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card. 
Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards, type M, doesn't recognize them. Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar, they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed 
I ordered a Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. I didn't know there was such a thing. When it came everything worked perfect and for a price everyone could afford 
Buyer beware. This reader does not work with large SD cards. I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card. My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work. I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet 
Completely satisfied with the Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. Simple and easy to use 
Easy to hookup and Windows XP displays the drives of the Lexar. Easy to drag and drop files into the drives. Highly recommended 
Well, I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $149.. I love mine... The sound really is great, and the price was AWESOME! I use mine for DVD's, my TV's regular sound for all TV I watch, and also as a Tuner to listen to the radio/ CD's in surround sound. Some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers... I don't know if this helps or not, but I will share- I had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and I did NOT put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit. I thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference, so if you have that whine, make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment. Mine does not make any noise on standby, or skip at all either. I am very happy with mine. 
I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar 
The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer. The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem. Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit. I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service 
This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room. Assembly takes about two minutes. The instructions are very clear. The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film. Why then do I give it one star? It skips. Like nobody's business. At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched. But then we put in new disks. No difference. When exactly does it skip? Impossible to tell. Sometimes a little. Sometimes every frame! Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad. Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip. So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back. Save your money! Buy from someone else 
Nice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality. Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it. 
I puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance. The DVD playback is fantastic - you really feel the surround sound - and the speakers work well. It can get pretty loud too. The only minor issue I have is when I'm in "TV" mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low. I've experiemented with all of the modes but can't seem to be able to get them up to the volume I would like. This is not a problem when playing a DVD or using the radio tuner, however. Set up was extremely easy and a complete "no-brainer". Great system for a great price 
this dvd system is sweet the sound system is off the hook its worth your Doller 
This home theater system is great! It was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions. Once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear. Highly recommended for the price you pay 
the item ordered performs well in what it is supposed to do 
Great item for homes lacking phone jacks. Easy to set up.Better than trying to hard wire 
Works great!!! I have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room. This jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cor 
Ok, I got this as gift so I got nothing to lose right! Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle. Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere! On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol! Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go. So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it 
Why would you want this item? Amazon is charging $50 MORE on this item than the 2nd Generation Shuffle! And, according to what I have read, THIS Shuffle isn't very derable. It doesn't even last a year! I don't know about you, but I'LL get a 2nd Generation Shuffle 
The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for. On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties 
One day it just stopped working. I got the dreaded "orange and green flashing lights of death"... the contents of the File space were un-recoverable... and I ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it. Apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that Apple likes to keep hush-hush 
Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods. 
This printer produces 4X6 prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab. The quality is fantastic, and the relatives were in awe. I am very very happy with the printer and the Canon S400 camera I use it with. I now have a portable print studio. Do not confuse this printer with ink jet printers. It uses dye sublimation, a completely different printing process. The result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard, not a piece of paper. You don't put ink in it, so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer. You buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from Canon. (KP-36IP, for example 
This printer was very easy to use. Just pop in the cartridge, paper, and plug in the camera. The camera has to be a certain type of Canon, but there is an available computer cable (I have not gotten it yet), to hook up other cameras. The benefit of using a Canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer, and still print out pictures. These pictures look beautiful, and the colors are true and bright. Printing couldn't be easier and fast. I was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs, press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling. It's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture. Instant gratification 
If you own a Canon digital camera this printer is great. It is portable and makes great prints. People think they are from a photolab. It is also vey easy to use. I have seen other mini printers from Olympus and Sony and they are not as good. They cost more too 
This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices 
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice 
This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
PROS Small Cute Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup. USB 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well. Runs cool. CONS Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them. The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated. Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs). It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer. And I still have 3 more ports. And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub. It does what it says 
lovely. my pictures are so nice an clear.not like the other cards i had where the pictures came out so blurry. i would recommend this card to anyone who needs it. thanks again.cscott rvc, n 
The extendable arm breaks very easily. I had two of them and they both broke within the first month. The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement. Very poor product. Do not buy 
I recently purchased this as a replacement for my Monster Cable. I must say that I am quite impressed. This is the best FM transmitter I have encountered. I live in Seattle. There is a fairly saturated FM dial, and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals. That said, I only have minor problems with interference, the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges. Functionality is pretty much seamless in my car. I drive a 2003 Ford Focus. The 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash CD changer, so accessibility is not an issue. If anyone is in the market for an FM transmitter for their iPod, I highly recommend this one. "That'll do, pig. That'll do. 
Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last. 
I have been using this transmitter with my IPOD photo for a few days. This stuff work flawlessly and the transmission was strong enough. I tune the same radio frequency from another car and the sound still clear enough. If there was an interference, all I have to do just re-setup to the empty channel. This stuff will overpowering the other channel if available. The only drawback for me is once you plug the arm connector to the transmitter, it will hard to re-open again. It might broke the plastic construction if you are not careful. 
First off, the ipod jiggles no matter what you do, secondly, it doesn't stay straight on the power plug, it constantly tilts(the whole thing)...not worth $10 
I tried two different devices before this one, and they simply did not work satisfactorily in a big city with a very crowed FM band. DLO Transpond is excellent, I drive through Sao Paulo, Brazil which is a huge city with almost 20 million habitants and consequently many FM stations in the dial. Occasionally I need to switch station but most of the time the same works fine all day long wherever I have to drive. Mounting was simply, I use the extension arm provided to get a handy and firm location. In short, I am totally satisfied. 
The DLO transpod works perfectly with no static. I was hesitant to purchase this. I thought because it works through the radio, there would be some interference or static. Well, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. I was so pleased with this product, I purchased one for my husband, and my sister and two friends bought one too. For anyone who has an ipod, this is a must have! Another great feature is that the transpod charges your ipod while you are listening to it. I have NEVER needed to charge my ipod. You can set this up any way you want it in your vehicle. It takes up very little space. This product is definitely money well spent, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an ipod 
I bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp. The audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations. No lag while playing my Playstation 2 console... The only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press "SOURCE" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it's annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it's a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space 
Application is dual input from cable TV input and analog PC input, used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation. 1) Audio output stops intermittently a few times a week, requiring power off/on to regain audio. 2) There appears to be no way to disable unused source modes. To switch from computer input to TV input requires one push of the Source button...... but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes - as the TV cycles thru AV, S-Video, Component modes, and finally back to PC mode. A weak design - the unit should recognize which input is enabled - it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes. This is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a TV/PC monitor. Picture quality is acceptable for the application, which is primarily watching news channels while working at PC, or displaying dual PC applications 
I was very surprised at how good the color is on this TV. I've has it for a year and love it and many friends have bought one and liked it as well. It's a great price for a LCD TV. 
While I am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me, I am a little disappointed. I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace). Bose failed me once, shame on them. They failed me twice, shame on me. I'm gonna go with something else 
For those who expect true 5.1 Dolby Surround out of the Bose 3-2-1 system, please look elsewhere. This unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area. You need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised. I bought this system probably a month or two after it came out, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it's still going strong. I owned an apartment and wasn't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand, so this system fit the bill quite nicely. Did I know I wasn't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience? Of course I did. The big drawback to this system is really the lack of Component Video. I only wish it had Component Video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there I was kicking myself... and still kicking myself. For those who complain that it doesn't play all videos, I will say this. I have also had issues with it not playing videos. What I discovered was that it wasn't the DVD's but the transfers or the video type. VCD has issues, SVCD mostly plays and of course every commercial DVD I have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the DVD itself, like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface. Bottom line is that when I keep my DVD's clean, my Bose system is friendly. If you've got bootleg DVD's, don't expect them to play in your Bose DVD, they probably won't work. More to the point, they probably shouldn't work becuase you shouldn't buy bootlegs anyway 
Having owned this system now for a couple of years I have had my ups and downs but overall I am pretty happy with it. For the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers. Yeah! On the negative, I don't really understand why they skimp out on the DVD side of things- I mean my $200 pioneer handles the range of DVD's much better. Of greatest concern for me though has been voice re-production. Voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds, and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem, it doesn't do a very good job. Consequently, it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and DVD's. Also, just a small note, to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud (so if you don't care too much for neighbours that won't be a problem). Overall, my music sounds crisp and I love hearing every little noise in my music, so I still have a smile on my face.  
SELLER'S: For an honest review go to the CORRECT page for the Bose 321 Graphite w/ Accoustimass 3rd module and two satellite speakers. That will have the correct retail rate and draw the true end-buyers/purchasers. This price of $700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here. I hope this helped you in your endeavors and I look forward to honestly/fairly competing with you in the future! BUYER'S: Buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or "mistakes" on the sellers' part in contractual agreements to Amazon customer service. Because if this ad by that company/seller is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system (2 satellite and 1 lrg Acoustimass) you are in for a steal! literally, so get a goin! Lol Disclaimer: this review is an anti-review posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description (which is it?? 2 speakers or 3???) in this advertisement for above mentioned product. Why isn't BOSE listed as a seller?! DOH No slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true 
I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology. But there is a reason this item is discontinued. It locks up when playing certain DVDs. Sometimes after selecting "play movie" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen. Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say "Bad Disc" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing. You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system. Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know. But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule 
I bought this 18 months ago and while I had some problems with the set up, I got help from the store where I bought it. It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject! Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose. That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it. Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)! They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work. There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else! Any recommendations? Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them. I normally don't like having to pay extra for a warranty, but if you insist on getting this product, I'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty 
I live in a small home and a large 5 speaker system with sub-woofer,plus reciever and dvd/cd player was just too much. True, the 3-2-1 doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistels of a lot a less expensive systems, but the size, ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock 
bose 321 is a nice stuff and good for the room. the sound is clear and crisp. a lot better than a usual mini component. no need to set up an elaborate sound system because this will do the trick.handy and easy to use. good quality sound for such a small piece. thou a little expensive but no regrets because its a bose. im a satisfied customer. so far i dont have problems. please dont let me have one 
This charger is really good value for money. This charger shows each battery's status individually and charges them quickly. i did not monitor the time to count the minutes and seconds but it was reasonably fast. Also refresh feature is best. i like the looks and functions of this charger 
We used this charger with a DC inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a Sony DSC-H5 camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges. The 2700mAh battery is great 
Charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking. Charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest 15-minutes charger I used. but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly. The build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side. compare to the one I previously owned. Generally, well worth the money. GOOD BUY! 
You can never ask for more from this product. 2700maH. That's huge. Runs my discman for weeks (I roughly listen 1 hr everyday). The digital display is very good and accurate. The refresh feature is what makes it different from other similar products. Now forget about the "memory" bug in your battery. Given the price, it is worth your while 
Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised. The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair. The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless. 
If you are trying to get a good quality charger, then Sony BCG-34HRMF4 is made for you. Pros: 1] Looks Good 2] Battery Indicator. 3] Can charge single battery/cell at a time. 4] Auto power cut off 5] Also works with 240V in Europe. 6] Sleek and light wiegth 7] Refresh button - works really good to get ur battery life/power back. Cons: 1] Its fast but not that fast. It also depends on the Batteries you are using. 2] If started Refreshing, then will take more time [still its good 
This is the second Wacom tablet I own and the third tablet in general. The other wacom is the 9 x 12. Which, at the time, I thought was the greatest. And the Hyperpen (my first tablet for a starving artist)... well, don't. Don't buy it. Stay away. Horrid thing. Save up and get a small wacom. With the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right. The size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors. And, with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area. The touch stripes are useful but really not necessary. Only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability. The 6 x 11 is just about perfect 
Having the Wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures. It is the best investment I have made lately in my business. It saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other over-use/strain problems related with high mouse useage. I can be much more precise on my work in photoshop! I would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers "must have list" 
This is a great product and company. The install was free of problems and the tutorial on the CD got me up to speed in a couple of minutes 
It's a great item, I'm loving it. It's been veru helpful in my scrapbook photos.. 
The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it 
This product is wonderful. I have had it for about a month and use it with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Corel Painter IX and it still amazes me. In my research, I saw that many people were purchasing the 6x8 size (maybe for price), however, if you have a widescreen format monitor, like myself, you will be much happier with the 6x11. Once you are over the short learning curve, you will find you even use it over your mouse for regular computer use 
Title: Intuos3 Tablet Publisher: Wacom Publish Date: Unknown ISBN/Model #: PTZ631W Reviewer: Robert Saucier Rating: 5 stars In 1997, after buying a new top-of-the-line 450MHz Pentium II system, I splurged on a Wacom ArtZ II tablet. Oh, my! Pressure-sensitive, tilt-sensing, pointer control, assignable function pads; it was Heaven. After a couple of years, every time I tried to use it with my primary graphics application, my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive. I watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but, as technology marched on, my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats. Sadly, I disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away. Lately, I've been feeling the pull once more, that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse. Miraculously, a Wacom Intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped, almost literally, into my lap. Sleek, gun-metal gray, sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen (much like my coveted Pilot G2 pens) AND a mouse! Even better, the Intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities: Adobe Elements 4.0, Corel Painter Essentials 3, and nik Color Efex 2.0 lE. Heaven just got better! The Intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution, over twice that of the Wacom Graphire product line, and, with its USB 2 connection, there's more than enough communication bandwidth, meaning better tablet to application response. One hesitation I have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else. The Intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me. I've used all of my "usual" programs and have had no problems at all. The tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives, a wireless desktop receiver, a card reader, a scanner, and a printer, all riding the same USB bus. The Intuos3 has 8 "chordable" buttons, 4 at each side of the tablet, to which keys, macros, or other actions may be assigned. The default for each group are the usual ALT, CTRL/Command, and Shift, along with "space". The placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet, holding one or more of the buttons, while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand. Being chordable, you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like ALT-CTRL-S or To the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well. The default setting is to scroll or depending on the context. The ends of the strip, in keystroke mode, can be set to playback macros. The pen, with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus AND "eraser," also has a DuoSwitch. The DuoSwitch's two positions may also be programmed. The pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback. With the ergonomic grip, the pen is extremely comfortable to hold. The 5-button mouse, designed to be used by either "righties" or "lefties," is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility, this is more than acceptable. As with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the Intuos3, the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options, although I've yet to find the "fix photo," "illustrate article," or even the "design website" settings. I can see only two very minor changes that I would make to this fantastic product. I would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen. It is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already, this feature would be the feather on the cap to me. The other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the Graphire (and was on the ArtZ II). Sometimes, having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time. For the casual home user, I would recommend the Graphire product line -- this Intuos3 model's SRP of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the Graphire is more affordable. For the pro-consumer or professional, however, whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration, the Intuos3 line is well worth the investment. It's great to be in Heaven again ... 
I'm a cow and like most cows I use Photoshop heavily. All I can say is that I can not believe that I went as long as I did without this tool. Other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes. One thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode. I use a 24" Dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and I was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration. Wacom definitely did their homework. To be honest I found it to not be that useful in 3D Max, but in Photoshop it's a WMD 
Ok, if you have two monitors side by side, or a single wide-screen format, this is the way to go! I use this tablet with the Mac G5, with full functionality, and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen. I have used the smaller tablets from Wacom, and they work very well, but this particular product is designed and constructed VERY WELL and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use! Having the assignable "ExpressKeys" left and or right is really slick for repetitive tasks. This model stands 5/8" high/thick, 10 and 7/8" deep (front to back), and just under 16 and 1/2" wide. Take two late model white Mac keyboards and set them one behind the other, and that is about the footprint this item covers, (width and depth). So, you will need some desk space, or I have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen. Quite comfortable! In any scenario, this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use. Thanks Wacom 
The Sandisk 2GB SD is a high-quality name-brand product. It holds up very well to everyday use. The plastic casing and write-protection button is very solid - not flimsy or cheaply made like some other brands in this price category. In August 2006, I bought two SanDisk 2GB cards (new $30 each) as extra memory for my Palm TX PDA, and they work great for storing pictures, video files, backup data and programs. I also use them every day with a USB adapter for backing up PC files and transferring data to and from home and work. They work flawlessly. Before I bought the SanDisk, I had a bad experience with a Corsair 133x 2GB card (about the same price), which had a little faster read/write speed than the SanDisk, but it was so cheaply made that it started falling apart within 2 months, including the write-protection button which fell off when I plugged it into my SD reader slot (Arrrgghhh!) I have been very pleased with the SanDisk 2GB SD, and at $30 (new), I believe it's the best buy for the money. One web search will show you that this card sells (new) all over the place for more than twice this price. And oh yeah... stay away from "used" cards... who knows where they've been or how long they've been used. For me, it's not worth it to take a chance with my data on a used card. I hope this review helps. The SanDisk 2GB SD (new) is a smart choice 
This card is not too fast but good enough for my camera... Well that means nothing to me, I don't have your camera and I could buy it for other things. There are 65 Reviews as I'm writing this, and nobody has contributed speed tests, not even estimates! The ones that don't mention speed at all might not care, but those who do should at least give approximate read/write timings. The easiest way to do this is by plugging the card into your high-speed card reader (not your camera or other specific device as the device can be limited in speed). Then select a bunch of image files or any other files (at least couple of hundred MB worth of files) and copy them to the card. Time this. Divide the total MB amount by the time (in seconds). And you will get approximate information of this card's Write time! Do the opposite to test the Read time. This won't be 100% exact, but if at least 2 or 3 people do this, we'll get a pretty good idea of the card's Speed capabilities 
The delivery and the product was good. I got what i was expecting 
After i purchased this card, i have travelled a lot and have taken several pictures... it just works perfect with my Canon digital camera. 
So much cheaper than buying a flash mp3 player... I've had this and other similar Sandisk memory cards for up to two years without a problem. Have dropped them repeatedly with no loss of data. Transfer speeds could be quicker for taking photos, but overall, a great buy, especially as it expands the capacity of my Treo 650 to five full length movies or twenty-four cds worth of music. I only wish someone would make a practical case that could hold multiple secure digital cards-they're so compact, I have to be careful not to misplace them. 
I bought 2 of these cards and use them in my Treo. I can fit several movies and tv shows on each card which makes for a quick commute on the bus/train or even a nice getaway over lunch.. 
This SD card is pretty good, and of course, very very cheap. Maybe the speed is a little bit slow comparing with other SD card, but it won't cause too much proble 
It is very good on memory storage. It can keep my photos much more than 800 photos. However, with pretty big memory, my camera is so slow that I have to wait for one miniute before it is ready to take photos 
Fabulous product --- now I can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range. Happy I purchased this one -- very trouble free
